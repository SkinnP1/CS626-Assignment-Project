1,i grew mr burke s lousiana know cities writes  this book like visit home  this murder mystery novel  like  usually n t read murder mystery novels  this book inward struggles dark side humanity well public issues  mr burke puts reluctant hero middle murder captures esscence cajun culture 
0,this third burke s robicheaux books i ve read   opinion  worst  give credit  burke s descriptions ethereal  characterizations  least  dave  clete  vivid make  unfortunately  political rants honk unpredictably obnoxiously throughout books  especially  like amateur tuba player beautiful symphony  i entertained  preached  there times denouements leave much desired  as mystery reader  puzzle important  i make sense  i loose ends tied

1,if read reviews  notice i m big fan gemmels  i love books  none  except  i ever rated  star  the characters fantastic i even became mournful ever died  in novel i m able pick favourite character right begining  story i could decide i liked most the demons brilliantly contrasted another i love way odds stacked goodies  you really feel way  i promise never predict ending this drenai book  yet seperate nadir story line  so n t read link others  simply put  best stories ll ever across 
1,some authors manage completely ruin great characters simply stopping  i think readers genre love get great awe inspiring acts fresh scene heroes  david gemmel manages show readers happens heroes get old gemmel talent creating great scenes  there authors  perhaps describe fight scene detail zeal  david gemmel deliver simple scene make seem like pearl hidden oyster  the action packed book  enough readers like keep us turning pages  i enjoyed character intereaction book  he n t try make love characters  fact characters quite opposite simply put great book  author writes great fantasy  it definately worth picking love fantasy genre

1,defoe written wonderful woman  moll flanders   created book entirely enjoyable outlining exploits life  moll quite remarkable woman time  he covers earlier life crime punishment ensued right later days reformed  she made quite marriages  learned grew  although marriages intrigues undertaken pursuit money  actually without passion generosity  there quite bit moralizing throughout book  totally enjoyable nonetheless moll human defoe created living  breathing heroine realistic  especially   quite accomplishment  especially male author

0,let me start saying story moll flanders fairly exciting one  the story changes venues circumstances often grows dull places  it well written filled beautiful description  however  i never finished book due two crucial criteria  reason  there chapters  i find quite discouraging   without breaks  i often lose spot feel like i m accomplishing anything reason   just like review  every noun capitalized  if found annoying here  imagine pages it i would recommend book casual reader  if re literary scholar  however  dive right  s important work

1,this book left feeling bit disturbed  though i enjoyed  extremely well written  kurt vonengut filled page detail imagery  honestly  i felt cold damp howard campbell physically feeling  vivid   but i never knew what howard campbell really  nazi sympathizer spy  sending secret messages hate filled radio broadcast   did become good pretending really started feel way  hmmm   i guess purpose story  leave guessing  maybe something i n t catch answered question  this book emotional roller coaster reader well  follow mr campbell s ups downs friendships  loves helpful  contact   
1,solid vonnegut the description cover gives n t really story justice this twisted dark love story  involving empty memories dark satire woven throughout  mr vonnegut do not quite  stars  i ve read sh cat s cradle if i new author  d different story however  i know s capable  n t quite best close though  highly recommended 
1,all i say  book changed life  i read mid s  never forgotten s message  you pretend  so  better careful pretend 
1,i generally get around reading book year  i tend buy year i seem hand like jehovas witness copy watchtower all  s biggest waste money  this perhaps finest literature penned english  read  you laugh really think crying 
1,  mother night  books hard put  the main character life playwrite excellently done vonnegut  usual twists  turns  sudden revelations  this book must read

1,vonnegut writers everybody either loves hates   s little middle ground  he s like vanilla coke   mother night  situated right narrow little line  it s book anyone enjoy  even ardent foes indiana s favorite  it third novel   represents sort pre caricature phase ended breakaway success  cat s cradle  two years later  here see vonnegut human  ways  vulnerable switches bombastic humor lets reader see behind curtain of course  characteristic vonnegut still shines  s muted disarming candor love lost stagnation breeds  if n t know anything vonnegut  great place start  if love  book make melt  if hate  well  might least give pause

1,an interesting  almost crazy  ride later years howard campbell  american born  german playwright turned nazi broadcast propogandist  then re turned american spy vonnegut said  humbly  writing  line jokes strung together  there slapstick farce  great fun entertainiment  what saves craziness vonnegut s ability write well noble things love kindness  friendship decency  so laughs thinks feels reads   and almost everything else kurt vonnegut wrote 
1,mother night favorite vonnegut books  along the sirens titan hocus pocus  it different majority works  vonnegut rely obvious comedy  space travel  in account accused nazi criminal  vonnegut lets reader deep within campbell s mind  order allow verdict waver back forth guilty guilty  this brilliant novel  deals issues deeper vonnegut lets  a must vonnegut fans  
1,this deserves modern classic  right slaughterhouse five  the naked dead  catch  it disturbing relentlessly insightful book human condition  a agrees act nazi propagandist wwii order able transmit coded messages allies  but look beyond good intentions  still question side aids  side proclaims profess  side secretly tries aid  as mr vonnegut writes introduction   we pretend  therefore must carful pretend   read  n t see film 
1,this book fantastic  the plot worth price book ending throw loop  i know me the book quick read n t really alot historical facts detailed descriptions  this book different vonnegut book ambiguos  we never find nazi s decided give campbell show oss decided use campbell spy despite book fun read  its funny often hilarious  especially describing aging racists america   i would reccomend book reader age  its  quite simply  good story 
1,in  pretend  careful pretend    what message  what impact book   many people might see weak story  indeed i   underlying message highly important  and indeed  books gets engaging points fast paced story times  lot   action   drama

1,the book arrived soon i ordered  its description accurate price great 
0,i believer loves lewis narnia books  argumentative books  including  mere christianity  often rather lacking basic coherence  the gaps logic often dumbfounding my favorite example lewis s argument accept jesus wise unless accept god  anyone claims god  n t god  barking mad  putting aside issue whether  hisorical jesus  actually made claim  alas  anyone ever taken even cursory look great writers sages throughout history knows minute fount wisdom next absolutely rocker  dostoevsky springs immediately mind and thats worst gap logic book so  looking reasoned defense christianity strongly advised go straight g k chesterton s the everlasting man skip 
0,cs lewis managed chronicles narnia prove mastery clumsy religious allegory  and  mere christianity  tries approach thorny topic god s existence divinity jesus using  logic    reason   it s subtle piece elegant design craftsmanship tractor factory rostok facile arguments bolted together using bold assumptions krazee glue faith  it s amazing anyone could send clunky contraption plough furrows logic reason sow seeds unconditional belief  i read book i think think thing got right title  bang on

0,a friend lent book i reading bible class uc berkeley  i told i understand christianity thought book may help  however  book really makes feel christianity intellegent religion  it insults intellegence presenting arguments matter fact  although book philisophical  tries convince readers conservative christian belief possible explanation world  to achieve goal  showcases philosophies beliefs simplified biased way mocks nonsense whole viewpoint sound stupid  the value i see book shows conservative christians thinking  you get sense coming  however  interested christianity depth  check books like st augustine s confessions 
0,though lewis often described christianity s best thinkers writers  book  actually three books combined  support description  while easy read  book contains nothing overly simple reasoning  faulty logic  double speak  unsupported  unsupportable  conclusions  this book avoid unless lesson write easy read  intellectually dishonest  book religion

1,there never another hollywood debut quite like barbra streisand s funny girl  probably never  everyone knew could sing beautifully  film proved actress  great  streisand proves true star  hilarious film s uproarious opening s absolutely heart breaking dramitic  she picked well deserved oscar work here the rest cast good  omar sharif especially suave role nicky arnstein   production values high  music great  direction lively  story touching but else  streisand s versatile extremely likeable performance holds whole film together  watch laugh  watch cry  watch entertained  a classic 
1,this introduction barbras holds  today  just great film  wonderful music terrific costumes 
1,i recently rewatched funny girl first time perhaps twenty years  and though i still think fine film i charmed i earlier days  maybe i ve read much real fanny brice nick arnstein found sanitized arnstein s life story broadway musical film quite closely adapted  for whatever reason i find omar sharif s portrayal handsome gambler nick breathtaking viewing i actually found accent annoying  at rate film still must see musical lovers like interest entertainment history though viewer aware great deal license taken retelling bittersweet love story  and streisand course young full powers star making role fanny still seems positively tailor made voice  looks screen presence 
1,funny girl old fashioned musical telling old fashioned story  the real life star fanny brice  played barbra streisand  the songs fantastic  especially my man don  rain parade  costumes full life color  omar shariff dashing nick arnstein  gambler husband  walter pidgeon good folrenz ziegfeld  anne francis small part fanny  showgirl friend  personally  i would wanted role little larger 
1,they weren t sure wanted movie   she s odd looking   even ugly times   story tells barb submit extensive test film front columbia executives   it really vehicle barbra  she dominates film completely cast challanges bit  even  good looking film directed master william wyler  musical scenes directed herbert ross  though barbra s fanny brice abnormally ambitous  still manages us feel  like  admire     it really must drama musical lovers 
1,by time barbra made funny girl  movie debut   already broadway singing diva  thankfully  forever immortalized cellioud fanny brice  funny girl funny girl  with funny girl got belt  barbra belt  multiple show stopping numbers including  people     do n t rain my parade  exhilerating  my man   she sang  acted charmed movie goers lined make funny girl box office smash  then well deserved oscar best actress  way go girl  you deserved praise got funny girl  what performance  a must have dvd classic musicals collectors and or barbra fans

1,another excellent book david sedaris  i could n t put i finished  anyone truly understands humor could way dissapointed book  the hilarious stories family give personal look life  while stories amusing  time re able see much truly cares family  despite visible flaws  the humor writing matched  definitely enjoyable read 
1,before heading america i wanted read something entertaining heavy  i picked david sedaris  dress your family in denim corduroy  i think many stories published esquire  gq  the new yorker so i read several  however  make less funny enjoyable second time around  in fact  i enjoyed collection much i basically finished reading day  forcing pick another book journey  sedaris never fails biting  savage  satirical  accurate  uproariously funny stories  there s lot relate since writes families petty concerns human condition  greed  jealous  envy  pride  vanity  etc   i think s something everyone relate least laugh 
1,i took book work read customers laughing hard people passing giving odd looks  this great book  i would not say characterizes  normal american life    normal  anyway   who knows   sedaris brilliant  i n t wait read books s written 
1,i m huge fan david sedaris  any writer makes almost pee pants every ten minutes always holds special place heart  so i saw coming new book  i totally excited although n t disappoint describing extremely weird idiosyncracies  i found n t rolling floor funny previous books  there moments though  my particular favorite tries stick sister middle road exact revenge mother  you n t find stuff like normally  if read sedaris  definetely buy  least support smoking habit   if n t  try picking books first  sedaris borderline insane  bluntness refreshing say least  and thought family nuts  
0,people might even find intersting  maybe i overdosed family stories much funnier first two books  i feel well run dry  i would classify sedaris writer books people dont really like reading   or like easy stuff hip think hip read bridget jones type books  even alain botton much creative time would better satisfingly spent reading julian barnes  michael cunningham  anne tyler  jane smiley  chekhov s  john cheever s john updikes stories 
0,let start saying david sedaris favourite writers  i anticipating new book quite time  sadly say  i terribly disappointed  previous efforts  naked   me talk pretty    caused laugh loud inappropriate places  often  even repeated readings  with exception  six eight black   christmas another country  funny  i could muster smile half essays  several stories downright unappealing  especially  chicken henhouse    girl next   both underlying theme relating fear accused pedophila  both left feeling kind creepy  if first effort  perhaps i would forgiving  all s bad book  i expected better  i m still fan    
1,i impressed book  overall  i n t find funny  me talk     however  i found solid  the stories overall seemed tighter  sedaris talent blatantly honest portraying harsh honesty would make people wince  he often portrays negative way makes reader feel underdog sense loyalty  my favorite essay  me talk      you ca n t kill the rooster   his  rooster  essays book disappoint  this book really gave strong sense family  his writing relatable feel family could idiosyncrises  drama humor  you definitely enjoy book 
0,tried reading  made   pages  m pretty sure s bad sign  seem recall mr sedaris writing mother s bedpan something  impression instantly got  beep beep  pretentious young writer peddling so called bad childhood experiences for fame  money and sympathy   guess  mr sedaris  n t give  expletive deleted  so called bad childhood  millions people bad childhoods n t play sympathy card  check augusten burrough s books  manage humor touching moments without kind pretentious style

1,i really skeptical i first bought refill system hp cartridge  i tried  i followed instructions carefully presto  my cartridge filled working perfectly i used buy new cartridges  i switched remanufactured cartridges office supply stores  i would use remanufactured ones send local pharmacy store offered refill services   finally  i got fed up buying cartridges pharmacy place kept telling cartridge failed work  i got easy use refill system one big tip  refill often  n t refill hits empty  if start seeing printouts looking faded  signs empty cartridge   stop printing refill immediately  once cartridge runs dry  risk severe damage cartridge may cause failure work properly even refill  preventative maintenance key  every pages

0,i must agree schroedinger poorly written book  it seems novices ve seen two quantum physics texts lives fall smooth talking style griffiths  do n t fall  for example  section angular momentum spin worst i ve ever read  griffiths gets reader lost heap math without taking time describe picture behind   i m complaining level math book  failure communicating physical insight feeling quantum phenomena   even small book paul davies better written insightful griffiths my personal recommendations feynman lectures physics  volume iii  introduction quantum theory david park  even griffiths acknowledges text park excellent book   after two may hit shankar sakurai   as i said  book davies pretty good  
1,although book comprehensive  extremely good preparing students advanced course quantum mechanics  it easy reading  would great personal studying well  the chapters well organized  writing clear  problems well written  it still favorite quantum books  i think people learning quantum mechanics first start book go difficult ones 
1,after reading reviews excellent book  i would comment exercises reduced short work use mathematica run integrations  etc 
1,this great introduction quantum mechanics right doses math  physics good prose  it title says  introductory text people curious qm  griffths avoid controversial issues physical interpretation theory  part book appeal even non technical reader   his treatment topics always illuminating gives reader sensation understanding he she told maybe professor griffths would consider next up to date extended edition elementary particle book and or new text quantum field theory 
0,there several things i dislike book  the first overall treatment subject matter  the explanations incomplete sometimes left wondering equation follows another  griffiths introduces symbols notations without giving formal definition  as result  reading actual text usually help comes solving difficult problems  it infuriating look problem three hours still absolutely clue go solving  i problem difficult problems hours  i would like spend time actually working problem  instead staring  wondering start notation means author never defined  not recommended 
0,the book good parts  many flaws grant anything higher star  griffiths leaves many important steps  sometimes leaving problems covering  some topics covered briefly help this book seems popular among students informal writing style  cautious  many professionals i talked agree good book start learning qm  there many good books consider getting  choice  
0,i first saw book graduate student  some fellow students used book undergraduate text  with due respect said fellow students  barely ability articulate simple statements quantum mechanics  if re goal basic understanding machinary principles quantum mechanics  buy either liboff landau that said  i could see book could uses  if youa  understand linear algebra b  understand differential equations c  fond memoriesrd grade math d  would like impress friends uncertainty principle then buy book 
0,this worst book i ever used throughout college  a person quantum mechanics would understand using book  it provide enough examples explanation  certain topics discussed detail topics discussed  where background information  this book needs discontinued 
0,this text much like griffith s intro electrodynamics  if n t need learn anything  simple answer basic questions  buy book  if  however  taking class quantum mechanics  n t waste money  griffith brings interesting questions without ever answering  he offers assistance solving demanding problems would aid learning process  if re majoring physics stay away griffith whole  rholf much better publisher writer  check texts re serious education 
1,it well explained written language university level students able comprehend  there plenty examples illustrate problems theories  suitable junior senior physics science studnets 
0,this book worst texts i read subject quantum mechanics  griffiths presents subject glib manner presenting easiest material chapter leaving student drown problems without clue proceed  if ever need teach quantum mechanics  use feynman lectures 
1,this well written  beautifully done text beginners  though brilliant book like dicke wittke  sparked every page  alas  out of print   brings message  besides usual topics  i particularly liked treatment adiabatic processes berry phase  best i textbooks  the exercises effective  vary routine tough  i ve least slightly strains  wording  laws electromagnetism  but i liked teach   better  students loved  i wish i text like i fought old schiff  centuries ago 
1,david griffiths concentrates classic important qm proplems  schrodinger equation  finite square well  delta function potential  hydrogen atom  spin  etc  he touch qm  side line  issues  thus students efforts efficient  griffiths develops subject balanced easy understand way  his book could home studied without assistance instructor  certainly true many qm texts  the exercises well selected appropriate  many implicit explicit answers provided  along qm claude cohen tannoudji  i would rate best choices beginning student  while cohen tannoudji comprehensive elegant  griffiths basic focused 
1,i hate books put things difficult really  this book  it gives reader clear  consistent readable introduction quantum mechanics whithout usual pooha bigtalk griffiths precise  overly detailed opinion huge didact  he wrote introduction electrodynamics i found quality 
0,what uninspired  leaden  workmanlike book  quantum numbers  turn math handle crank answers  although supposed elementary book  mind numbing math many contemporary physics majors handle  much less discussion concepts need  if putting dead back cover friendly  book friendly  goswami s book  sadly print  much better motivation  n t much grind math  i wish book quantum would break mold try interesting today s students  churn old calculations old systems  harmonic oscillator  hydrogen atom  blah blah   it could sections quantum computing  laser trapping   this book 
0,do n t fooled informal style text  griffiths bad habit leaving many important results exercises  briskly jumps many difficult steps  he n t even provide plausability argument schroedinger equation  i know s necessary  would n t hurt provide steps schroedinger arrived famous equation  his exercises lousy little effect reinforcing material  a much better book  i  principles quantum mechanics  i  shankar  i  quantum mechanics  i  cohen tannoudji in short  griffiths  text many holes   it s shame book excellent  i  introduction electrodynamics  i   
0,i n t understand mr griffiths  undergraduate physics books popular  the low intellectual level writing discourage advanced students  yet physics watered n t learn much anyways  his books read like  physics for dummies  series griffiths  quantum mechanics book continues tradition  he introduces schroedinger s equation first page without giving traditional  plausibility arguments   he bypasses discussion old quantum theory  bohr s correspondence principle bohr summerfeld quantization conditions   he gives watered introduction dirac formalism fails adequately explain dirac s measurement theory important concepts simultaneous eigenkets non commuting observables there innumerable superior qm books undergraduate level  save money forget griffiths

1,the author wanted show lost innocence  i agree author boys innocent beginning time goes bye soon changes  the author best handled symbolism  for example  conch represented authority piggy s glasses represented nearsightedness  these symbols helped understand book  the book n t believable i n t think bunch boys ranging ages  really survive island  i think author n t piggy simon cruel way  if i choice i would ve let live i would ve ralph jack become friends again overall  i thought book good 
1,the sequence events throughout story well designed way golding s description abilities  sure  sometimes become annoying lose place lot  n t understand s going s  yet  still good  the book  though  within greater whole  well written believeable piece  some happened could happen really n t believable  yet  well golding described actually seeing  helped get effect real  also  none us really know would happen got stranded island  so n t know true untrue whole actions situation  some people might agree i said  everyone interprets things differently  i think

0,this movie  short  terrible  the storyline filled holes n t even close following original epic written long ago the actors almost seemed ashamed taking part f movie production  simply christopher lambert wield sword n t make right part warrior great beowulf meant  rhona mitra waste character  as gotz otto  out characters written epic poem two original names used  the rest changed omited unnecessarily the creature came grendel cheap even silly say least  the rest special effects second rate actors the scene grendel s mother drawn sad if see movie absolutely nothing great epic beowulf buy otherwise save money something better 
0,after reading beowulf i curious great epic could translated genres  part makes poem great language  it s chant like use alliteration  caesura compound wording makes beautifully nuanced reading  moreover  story essential parts themes keep reader intrigued  the film adaptation  however  none this i disappointed find besides ignoring  movie created ludicrous plot twists weakly contrived love interest far fetched psychological melodrama  to treat fundamentally christian pagan poem way near sacrilige

0,i bought this for almost bucks  it worked fine first  after four months it died on me  do i trashed it  it was good for the time being  i gave it less stars for the lack of life  i did not use it every day  i have really long thick curly hair and it was easy and quick to use  instead of using my iron on the ironing board  even that really works on steam setting and my hair straightens much faster the roots would stay curly without a hair appliance i would only recommend this product for a short term solution or a twenty dollar blow dryer with a comb will last you much longer and you can get the comb as a replacement in beauty stores

0,i kinda disapointed film hardcore punk sometimes represent beatiful life  but film sad  to see musicians talk many people fought much cooler rest punk  punk freedom hardcore became prison  the conformity tried escape became 
0,the film american hardcore  never mentioned seminal hardcore legends reagan youth  warzone angry samoans  the dead kennedys  misfits  husker du   seconds suicidal tendencies briefly mentioned way given due  much running time documentary focuses california  boston dc scenes  but cover cali depth without delving deep dead kennedys  the film completely disjointed rhyme reason move california boston back california dc briefly new york  i know intention good product subpar heinously omits bands gotten minutes contributions important underground scene  not recommended 
0,fortunately i rented neflix buy  i would recommend anyone knows anything interest american hardcore buy cd  first  impossible document history genre american music without mentioning focusing somewhat dead kennedys  dk important  important  black flag  this mess avoided 
0,i agree  reviews say movie basically disjointed collection clips  not anything bands like the misfits dead kennedys    movie disgrace  and canadian i offense fact use joey keithley source lot interview material  mention doa canadian band  not part american hardcore scene  the movie really disapointment 
1, ve part punk harcore scene years  documentary every newcommer needs see  great started  highly recommend anyone intersted understanding favorite band came  negative thought movie ends abruptly  inmportant hardcore bands mentioned dont believe scene  died   movie obviously focuses history hardcore would nice see second generation bands came  overall  loved 
0,they left way much   i mean kept going circles bands  plus dont mention alot bands big influence scene back day  could way better 
0,too much boston      straight edge nod boston s scene didntreally amount much  not enough la not even single dk mention     cmon
1,i fan hardcore music  documentary sure makes wish i part club the general message  peak hardcore moment time suburban kids created musical movement never duplicated what s great see camaraderie existed bands underground nature followings the great juxtaposition violence music  endearing feelings created people involved the look hardcore scene presented various interviews different musicians masterfully done even n t like music  give watch 
0,an ok attempt explaining really happened  most concert footage pretty unsatisfying someone  bad brains depicted well keith morris always entertaining  the movie title references years i really sure gang green concert footage  there mention dead kennedys  social distortion misfits seemed strange 
1,this decent documentary focusing origins centers hardcore scene s biggest best  the story unfolds starting california  spending much time  eventually breaks across country regional areas  unfortunately  quite bit focus smaller less known bands  omissions details misfits  husker midwest influential bands  however  choppyness film soley comes amount material try cram  hours  the bonus features nice  good job bad brains black flag stuff  be all punk hardcore knowledge  this film definately catch spirit movement  definately worth look 
0,great book  awesome topic  engaging interviews cool live footage   movie disappointing  maybe s disjointed never put various scenes context  especially chronological context   maybe s nearly every interviewee said thing  fans hardcore punk losers outcasts  true    scene reaction oppressive climate earlys  including fleetwood mac  disco   coke snorting hollywood types   parts made cringe  interviews guys like keith morris  reveal old age inarticulate burnouts   i agree posts well  dks  misfits  husker du   it s like hardcore dummies  since movie never scratches surface never presents material coherent manner  even dummies n t smarter topic watching  hopefully  someone right day 
0,two star rating live footage alone  waaaaay many douchebags interviewed  idiots burnouts like bruce loose  springa  vinnie stigma jimmy gestapo make embarrassed fan independent music general  jack grisham biggest offender   huh huh  i m cool edgy i pissed passed out girl    that s fault film though  people idiots back  historically accurate  i n t believe short shrift midwest got  best bands came region  oh well  rent footage  oh  hr looks really old 
1,this great entertaining view us hardcore  for us lived s fun nostalgic  we knew music scene something special time   nice see given s due credit 
1,if enjoy good old days pure hardcore punk  movie enjoyable good bringing back  interview best include clips best bands playing live i caught singing along clips wondering happened true art punk  ca n t wait  punk s not dead  please meantime 
1,compared book  film really glosses things leaves lot things  i still think s worth checking  the fact documentary devoted exclusivelys hardcore makes happy  at least someone making effort document s late i wish someone would in depth definitive document hardcore s early years  this gets job done  could done much better  as i said  lot things left overall  interviews kind choppy  still get great interviews all  i d still say s decent introduction hardcore  especially people n t already know anything  s worth dvd collection show people  etc  after  pretty compelling story
