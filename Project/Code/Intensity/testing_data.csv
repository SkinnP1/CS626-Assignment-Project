3,  aiding abetting  muriel spark s trademark lightness deftness style  it n t deepest books  lacks poignancy best work  still sparkles  as muriel spark groupies know  lifelong fascination theme wrong person  murderer s point view  victim s point view  course  s always wrong person  murdered mistake  s almost happened young woman  i wonder reason true crime story appealed  i see echoes evelyn waugh book  meant praise  criticism  i miss undercurrent supernatural  especially sinister characters may may demons  characterizes best work  for reading muriel spark first time  i recommend favorite books   a far cry from kensington   you n t disappointed 
2,a vividly imagined might infamous lucky lucan  wanted murder  paris body double  settled overpriced psychotherapy former fake stigmatic ultimately ended sealing fate unexpected  unbelievable  way  although clever places  witty spots  i found book quick read primarily i wanted finished quickly  the characters brittle unsympathetic  the scenes artificial  the book flowed like swift stream  confident even cocky places  lacking kind depth makes dive swim 
2,i long fan muriel spark s  truly enjoying humor style  i liked autobiography well  but book great disappointment  the characters shallow  particular  dr wolf cardboard scarcely believable  there certain sense haste  events barely sketched  quickly brought conclusion  without going detail  a thin book indeed  would probably received much less attention author reputation 
3,i big muriel spark fan i know characters bit quirky conversation little surreal  that said  too much way  it came stilted  the main characters shallow  i saw noted reviews  book somewhat repetitive  i stick  pretty short n t much time  i brit teenager time crime  i remember remember  upper class  entitlement thing last throess  still  so so read author s usual standard

2,comes someone knew nothing legend lord lucan  still  opening story intrigued  however  book constantly repeating details shares us crime lord lucan s disappearance  felt book incomplete  key word repetitive  it s bore  pass   last two sentences need capitalization

1,for whatever reason deplorable bootleg pulled market  bootleg vendor ozit sued yet  if hear real  legitimate  officially released bat chain puller  please buy edition zappa family trust releasing february  do n t say n t warned shoddy ripoff 
5,despite protestations others  i personally love cover artwork fact finally hear supposedly tape don sent uk promoter roger eagle something like bat chain puler sounded  thios album raw energetic work captain magic band  definitely worth buying

1,guess expect much cd days  hear good songs good music  sadly disappointed cd  predictable boring save cash 
2,this cd n t too bad time i wish n t bought  i think singer said  let s see ruin record whining like country singer emotionally    and realllly bad way  oddly enough  absolute best song guys ever put n t featured either cd s   sweet summer  besides fact missing gem song  s nothing like first cd  nothing quite like cathy pop rhythms do n t stop cd  just kinda bland soft rock  i recommend downloading sweet summer best song far perhaps possibly buying first cd  n t waste time

4,weyse s   symphonies sound similar middle symphonies mozart  none rise greatness mozart s last six symphonies  enjoyable  graceful minuets dramatic finales  the royal danish orchestra michael schonwandt never misses step  well groomed mannered performances  perhaps best analogy i draw weyse mozart ferdinand ries beethoven 
2,aside tracks  namely memorable airship theme others  cd n t much novelty  something add collection  but look way  s uematsu  really  n t much go wrong

1,the acting bad  especially supporting characters  the actors n t helped awful dialog  the plot rediculous  though intentional  the low budget special effects silly  good way  in short  n t waste money stinker

2,one bushing fits doesnt  i chose make fit   will implode seeing brass squeak caboose better shutting 
1,i pleased i got parts quickly removing replace bushings pins i discovered two identical packages contained incorrect bushing  this incorrect part caused job twice long since i stop make bushing  maybe next time i ll make bushings bother parts made china

2,it since i heard jokes standup show  but i find dvd funny i expected it yes  o connolly unpredictable   robin williams  umpredictable  it seems rambles around  goes tangent forgets talking  jokes lose momentum something mentioned producers put lot effort cd  there  chapters  identify main themes show  for foreign speakers hearing impaired  closed captions  there extras  nothing  it s dvd says  play   go   hopefully helps decision 
1,billy connolly  live new york poor recording comedic talent artistically professionally  the stage set looks drab poorly lit  much like amateur would first chance recording finger puppets kindergarten class  the comedian s appearance matches set  leaving grey hair standing stepped shower  his comedy material seems impromptu  digressions never establishes  the roll  comedy bits  stories subjects  throughout comedy act  to frank  i fell asleep   way dvd decided use dvd beverage coaster instead i originally purchased dvd based upon samples material i ve heard satellite radio  i believe far better recordings artist besides dvd title 
1,unlike billy connolly dvds  failed offend catholics  muslims  women  gays  schoolteachers  foreigners good english  society  my wife  children local priest offended big yin offering this suprising clydeside comedian no taboo  regime comedy the reason offense taken simple dvds usa work uk oh yes took yonks deliver girls work got bit spooked packaging frankfurt airport fingerpost st helens still hun it nice box though

4,this give casual listener songs may never heard well old hank standards  confused the complete hank williams boxed set  for reason songs recorded  others  included  if important  great value less   the quality recording excellent packaging  check sets proper records great value eddy s song
3,during season excellent books college sports  shulman bowen s game life  murray sperber s beer  circus   duderstadt comes something dud  sorry   he calls reform college sports guy  president university michigan  tolerated special academic program  sports management  jocks academic problems sheltered  it really hard seriously background like  it s found religion  reform college sports good luck  i suppose critic big time college sports congratulated taking unpopular stand book little far late

4,these flakes  often powdery  better priced  even   oz  anything available near metropolitan area i live  used everything possible i got sick taste  i sprinkle hint cheesy taste b1 nutrition 
4,this nutritional yeast stuff find bulk bins many health food stores  the upside n t pawed zillion shoppers canister comes much sturdier easier store pantry flimsy plastic bags found bulk food aisles the reason i gave four stars instead five  small flake  nutritional yeast instead  large flake  i prefer  plus  although good  cheesy  flavor great using making vegan dishes topping popcorn  slightly bitter flavor experience  brands nutritional yeast n t seem 
5,blends easily  has mild taste  i put scoop nutritional yeast breakfast blender shakes  water  powdered milk frozen berries fruit  sweetener stevia   gives great nutritional boost  b vitamins great  nerves  work day begins i like protein  have taking yeast years  weeks get used taste i began  since i stirred milk  with fruit little sweetener  tastes really good

2,the taste i expected  i expected taste good i n t like flavor  i mixed pesto i normally use parmesan  it ruined pesto  not big fan cheese replacement  however  i m using nutritional supplement home made bread  flavor n t bread  so nutrition s good  good taste 
3,we  family vegetarian i thought could use natural vitamins brewers yeast contain  it hard add finished food even harder remember add cooking stage  the taste texture distinct hard disguise traditional foods taste 
2,not sure   working well popcorn   surely taste like cheese substitute  did dissolve hot water yet use broth drink   maybe way go far  impressed probably not buy

4,there lot disagreement topic book discusses  i thankful ra torrey great job presenting baptism holy spirit works based scripture teaches he really excellent job explaining following topics  what baptism does  how baptism obtained  refilling holy spirit  how spiritual power lostgiven confusion discussion doctrine  i think essential christians investigate topic decide believe  torrey s book excellent starting point seek learn 
2,this video ok  i give d maybe c  shaq s comedy series really good good others 
3,apart monique bit character comedians bringing flavor stage ok not something need rush buy 
2,i love comedy  particular video  opinion  overplayed use foul language cursing  cussin  there cursing real jokes  i mostly disappointed host  mo nique  the best comedian series far paul mooney  corey holcomb bringingnd place  the others ok  opinion 
1,monique bit much  didnt really enjoy mic  loved paul mooney piece way short  and last comedian corey funny  but i wouldnt recommend anyone else buy  if buying hear paul mooney s piece better waiting new stand comes next month  monique ruined dvd 
1,well starters monique s stand always involve male bashing looks i understand comedians garbage well  except paul mooney   this far sorriest shaquille o neal comedy video production  i definitely think video funny

3,yes okay  i ve seen better selections  it boils personal taste  if i nothing better would getting better review  i think i ve spent productive hours 
2,do n t like movies  description inadequate i n t way know type movies 
1,the cover dvd shows tarzan standing lion  the movie gordon scott featured scene n t even five movies  this definitely portrayed  i looking gordon scott movies  color   black white movies featured several  tarzans   only gordon scott  movie pictured cover dvd  this birthday gift someone looking gordon scott tarzan movies years  i thought i finally found  perfect  gift    not

1,i have k  n  car  years  yes increase gas mileage ruined maf sensor  years  i try cleaning w maf sensor cleaner helped temporarly ended getting new maf i ll probably go high flow filter w out oil next time joe
3,i agree tanya  i found book offers lot useful information  effectively hidden american public  but book would much effective editorialized allowed reader  decide  think oil industry i somewhat forgive author conclusion hydrogen fuel cells offer lot potential  given book written  however  given sizable barriers author cites fact plug in electric cars mentioned  i wanted see real data support case  such data nonexistent all told  i n t think best primer industry regardless political stance  i found  the rough guide energy crisis  much fact driven  though broader scope  there number books topic i encourage look elsewhere reading book 
5,1 pages beautiful  black white illustrations quality parchment paper  these coloring books i turn im ready something different color  personally speaking  i find fun  great change pace  i use almost medium terrific results  far less time  i prefer using tombow markers water applied  i get traslucent watercolor effect  back either felt marker  soft colored pencil  crayola crayons  hit hot iron melt wax s paper retaining bold yet translucent colors   i like buckling effect gives  lot s fun color   great projects kids adults alike  these designs great crafters 
4,at first i disappointed purchase  speaking seller  i reprized opinion business  the book slipped past quality control  making ammends  i get keep book i purchased  although i hoped suffice get percentage next purchace  thank custumer orientedrackham fairy tale stained glass coloring book  dover coloring book 
5,you definitely see pool middle  stick head branches    i absolutely loooooooove tree  it beautiful came box almost perfect  n t even fluffed branches yet looks wonderful  there many lights   one thing though  lights led n t soft yellow glow  instead s kind ice blue glow  like ice branches sparkly diamonds  so interested soft yellow glow  n t get tree  other s really bright  lights whole room  very nice tree  would buy 
1,i believe al ristori well respected fisherman normally shares valuable information cut chase manner but book fails live reputation it definitely  complete guide saltwater fishing   almost information presented book cookie cutter generic information easily found net free this book clearly labor love al merely put well know bank coin     disappointed process   
2,i totally missed point novel  maybe i need professor explain satire i get  i kept waiting story tell something society  never  after reading reviews  i led believe i totally missed boat  did i really 
5,candide is one the best love stories of all times  the book made me laugh  cry  hate  but most all love and see that true love will always find it true end  i was captured by all the characters  and places in this wonderful book  candide forbidden love to madame congande royalty to this commoner  candide  his quest to forget and yet be united to his most beloved  professor pengloss out look on life  that whatever happens in life is meant to be that way  sets forth the ideology  that we have no control over our destiny   compare that with congonde s military brother that believed that one can set and conquer ones destiny candide shipwrecked experience in eldorado was just great  showing that utopia and unity exist somewhere  but alas candide chosen course was to leave this place of perfect peace and unity and to seek forever his true peace and unity  his beloved madame congonde this is a must read book short and sweet i rate this book a true classichenry
2,this book never made print past eighteenth century  it sublety  monty python much better job getting point across without typical french bitterness
2,call philistine   candide  confuse enlighten  yes  i know story deliberately far fetched  almost surreal  still failed make impact even considering work context  absurdity travel far my sad brief review  candide  less meaningful today time writing  no  i found meaning life voltaire 
3,good stuff  m big fan classics  call classic   however  read sitting  personal record   although  must mention  paper due book later today might influence m reading time   s witty  funny  makes think  ask book  
4,read college english class  m much reader classics  surprised much like book  incredible use satire wit although  say  know would n t gotten much n t class taking  still found story voltaire s implications quite enjoyable 
5,when i started short book  i expected drone fests  however i pleasantly surprised find story gripping  satire comical devious  time well spent  i even read sections book younger siblings ages   paid attention great detail  i would highly recommend book classic reason 
4,i finished reading candide advanced placement senior english class  suprisingly  i actually enjoyed  having toiled many long  hard books troughout year  hilarious  short  easy to read book relief  i loved satire  voltaire constantly poking fun people ideas  times  i laughed loud way describes things  although best book i ve ever read  i definitely recommend 
5,i owned book quite awhile put reading  fearing would dull scholarly  i wonderful surprise  his philosophy makes lot sense puts forth simple story accessible almost everyone  many  many times i laughed loud  it fun well enlightening  the term  sixes sevens  used  etymology expression  the violence expressed absurd way  though know awful things happen 
2,candide may something day  modern reader marginally versed interestedth century france  i found reading rather dull   before i get comments i m stupid  i would like point although i sometimes like read classics fun  career focus always sciences  like satires i ve read  candide seemed heavy handed flat  the philosophy optimism silly  absurd things happen  cue another character stands symbols real personality  this i n t read satire often i gave two stars rather i recognize may potentially get chuckle ridiculous situations  someone well acquainted particular philosophies may find voltaire s criticism entertaining  and took day read  i suppose mark favor well 
3,start saying like voltaire much n t understand work overshadow  alphabet wit   get hold little book well worth time  far amusing intelligible candide  voltaire could funny really n t lot humour candide  thought candide bit boring times   not demolish argument best possible worlds  matter limitaions arguments complex  book deals none  still adore voltaire 
3,this book moderately entertaining fictional standpoint  however  maybe i shallow  i see philosophical genius frequently exalted work  i felt conclusion great let events led  perhaps viewed lense relevant time written profound 
5,everyone like story different reasons  it s easily read  toss phrase  i  frequent reader voltaire  think     alternatively  read and think  how strikingly funny  how incredibly relevant remains day  how possible challenge blind optimism yet wallow complete despair self pity  above  i found accessible work philosophy  ahem  i mean   i  frequent reader voltaire  think rather accessible work philosophy    
4,i picked book bookshop near ground zero  and suprise heavy story caused anguish read  i thought story told quick straight forward way fun educational  i agree really book ponder morals voltaire tries preach  book would n t entertaining  nice lite read  i recommend anyone age i think i know book taught many schools  hint anti semitism 
2,i disliked book strongly  if new style english brought meanings plain words would much better it took reading somethings   times understand real meaning  sometimes still n t make sense  i find weird story way back time really close lot stories jerry springer show to review would like old english literature  thats 
2,well  list time  maybe i expected much  i think probably bit taste  perhaps  i get satire   i get satirized   maybe i right frame mind day i reread it it short easily done 
2,i found book interesting entertaining  however i attempted write paper school  publisher information translator  i suggest version book students planning use papers 
4,this first attempt classic literature  i say interesting  well thought  dowright good  i loved descriptions  overall story  it gave new appreciation literature  short read  finished day half christopher berry
4,this hilarious rompth century world voltaire knew  this book provided make fun intellectuals day  cannibals eat jesuits  politics europe social mores elite  his characters include noble candide combines good heart reliance gilgamesh like helpers order succeed  his hero worship dr pangloss  rasputin like philosopher  later martin  bailed situations perhaps importantly lesser  cacambo saved life  all fantastic adventures candide experienced designed reunite true love cunegonde many years later  upton sinclair wrote  candide  like  utopian socialist fantasy novel  metropolis i reminded reading novel 
5,book pretty good  kind weird good  thought wasnt satire lit teacher said interpret  dont makes look like regular book would read 
5,i saw show chicago brilliant  the story honest heart felt  harvey magnificent job turning show cliched  gay  play 
3,pros   a film decent interesting background scenesb  creative monstersc  occasionally high frame rate action sequencescons   disjointed story telling going hunting infected hunting possessed connectionb  a failure connect flat charactersc  besides final battle  enough memorable visuals unfold beforehand in summary like works yoshiaki kawajiri sure miss film adds darker side anime aesthetic  though film sub par wicked city momments given honor rental 
3,komada koshigaya biologist battling humans infected virus turns demons one cool twist komada infected virus buts seems able fight virus enough keep human emotions intact sometimes transforms demon  helps koshigaya alot sence scientist battling demons overall pretty good idea simple plot the picture quality o k  dolby  sounded like pro logic go ahead pick n t dissapointed  notice anime last

2,this story group children left survive virus  hence series title  fire us   virus baby speak  killed human population some parts story interesting  one older kids  hunter  spends great deal time searching food old stores houses  the dialogue kids  however  tedious boring  it difficult believe children would acting way main characters story if read really good survival stories  try reading philbrick s last book universe robert swindells  brother land 
4,this book amazing the way author made sad exciting  the book made read even  but adults ones instead kids  the book could ve better sad exciting 
5,as adult loves children s fantasy survival novels  real page turner  it sounds morbid say i enjoyed  book  i n t think author s intent  i felt gloom sense foreboding dread entire time  it s gritty  real  immersing  even heartbreaking times consider story kids would grow develop without adults world  it reminiscent lord flies red dawn  little bit stephen king s the stand  thrown good measure  n t derivative these i must say style writing different engaging  two authors great voice  style  prose flows right along  impressive without obtrusive  i m excited reading rest series

4,dvd grainy  story deviate text somewhat  the packaging nicer richardson  hound baskervilles   i would still say granada version jeremy brett better two 
2,i suspect re garwood fan enjoy novel  to  novels similar  with ransom  takes reader yet highlands bit mystery  adventure  clan loyalty  romance  actually  romance aspect debatable b c attraction not romance far i m concerned garwood s characters  merely changes names books  i m saying dislikable  redundant  other reviewers boast garwood s best highlander romance  true  i interested reading others  it n t awful  old stuff 
2,i always liked julie garwood  roses   but book pretty lame  it echoes past style  vastly inferior  the first chapters confusing i checked see pages missing book  i tried hard like  many times read  brodick  yes judith  gillian  yes brodick  ian  yes ramsey  did ms garwood need filler  no talks way  i quite disappointed  read anyway 
1,this book promotes everything woman  stupid submissive  i sad gillian  i totally repulsed broderick  possessive rude pig  i bored book reaks day time soap  know going happen pages advance   i sorry  ms garwood ideal love surely seems like abuse  i truely sad women still find books like exciting interesting 
2,i read first pages book  i couldnt keep characters  i did read first book  the secret   maybe would easier keep i  either way  way confusing 
1,possibly worst book i ever read   history good being english term  pa paddle backside  really something modern english person would say let alone someone supposedly born reign king richard  it grated badly rest left cold  i love historical romances fiction please make effort get time period even remotely correct 
1,my aunt persuaded read book  i big fan romance i gave try  did book change mind geanre  no  really  the characters seem undeveloped  author told us upfront thought felt rather letting convey actions  brodick rude primitive  all comes mind talks  gruffly   word used times describe  i bothered count   as poor gillian  irritating even talk  to wrap  not interesting read   sorry gulie garwood  
4,this first book garwood i ever read  she intriguing way ending almost every chapter liners compels reader read  in chapter carries reader emotional climax racing back reality devastating line i definitely read works  would highly recommend 
5,i really loved book  when i read secret i thought characters brodrick ramsey would great another book  i m glad used  ransom great story wonderful heroes villans i loved hate 
5,once again julie garwood has written a book where i ca n t put it down  all i want to do is read  read  read  i feel that i am being taken back in time and that i am actually a part of the story  a third party  of course  ransom was a fun loving book with old characters returned from the secret  and they have a major role  not just a fly by night mention 
3,many points story  away dropping many characters books i garwood fan  characters large drop minor characters 
5,the ransom book julie garwood truely riviting characters life  i book paper well kendal book  favorite books far  i read ransom  times cover cover  everytime read capture true essense characters  i would love see younger generation books spring life  i seem get enough julie s  characters  ian  brodrick  ramsey patrick wives  i would love see story unfold more thank stories truley inspirational  a devoted fan 
4,i liked book  the characters enjoyable plot interesting  it little predictable though  
2,pleasant reading material  league julie garwood books i read  a good  much excitement 
5,i say i read ms garwood s books far favorite  i read several times still love every time 
5,i must admit  s since ms garwood written really truly good story  the characters well developed plot complicated enough predictably boring  she first  still  favorite romance author  this i could not put  i finished day  anyone loves historicals  definitely must read   
4,this another great book garwood  i admit  though  beginning kind confusing many characters  but  stick  falls place turns another great read like others  i m fan 
1,gillian claimed brodick s bride spark curiousity  he tricked marriage claim heart  what brodick n t know order claim heart  give  he show cared this truly heartstopping romance  i found i could n t put  it s brave  stubborn young gillian key finding king john s beloved jeweled box  key toughest hilander lord  brodick sinclair s heart
5,i love julie garwood s historical romance novels  especially ones highlands  reading book like catching old friends book the secret  if n t read the secret read first read ransom familiar characters  you fall love brodick gruff nature see pussycat  i wish ramsey bridgid s story bit longer  either way i would definitely recommend book read 
5,i huge fan julie garwood  i read every single book  but ransom deffinitely favourite  why i loved book  first  heroine weak  silly girl  she strong way behaves holds pain amazing  second  i feel love brodick gillian every time i read book  i assure  i read book  times already   besides  every single dialog means something i never got bored i reading book  the third thing deffinitely plain romance  people intrigues real conflicts pulling reader  there always something happening book never get bored  i would like say little i didnt like book even reason     loved   
5,i loved story    if like reread stories added  it lack miss anything  i came away book smile   come spring    the wedding  seemed lack depth i ve expect julie garwood i hoping praying see old julie back evidence  it wonderful  now i would like read nicholas clare s story  saving grace   
2,seriously  thought book deserved five stars  this first julie garwood book last  i enjoy dialogue characters  seriously  pages dialogue heroine six year old  the characters superficial amount dialogue way overkill  if n t told book set scotland n t frequently throw word  laird  i would idea  there culture  historical authenticity   i agree another review said read like someone s first novel  bad  i ventured outside normal genre historical fiction i got  i m giving two stars n t horrible  definitely cliche boring 
1,i n t read julie garwood  years  i enjoy  lion s lady  the bride  even  the secret   but  nothing changed historical novels  still flaky almost child like heroines  this long ridicules story  sorry julie  i grown historical novels  i still think talented writer  contemporary novels bad  sorry   
1,the kindle version pages order  incredibly frustrating  luckily i print version could figure going  i informed amazon n t buy digital version s fixed 
5,to ms garwood  i every book ever written absolutely delighted find favorite characters book  this book filled love laughter i had read cover cover  sad finally close book vivid personalities  should inclined allow characters fall love third book  i would thrilled 
5,i m people says would n t caught dead romance novel  imagine surprise friend loaned told mystery  knows i love i finally relized romance  julie garwood lovingly developes characters  interests  involves excties reader tells wonderful story  i ran right bought  prequel    the secret  wherein meet maitland clan many  ransom s  characters  my note ms garwood  please  please   us home gillian buchannan places people  keep us touch sinclairs maitlands  a trilolgy would joy  
4,i ll skip synopsis since many reviews already thoughtfully provided    after reading the secret  i knew i pick sequel  brodick interesting character  i feel though book dulled brodick s personality  throughout book  i kept hoping julie garwood would show facets brodick s character  also  i hoping would provide details ramsey found love  the brief glimpses see ramsey bridgit scene repeat  it d better took ramsey s story make another novel  it would much appealing  i m saying n t great love story  it lacks finer points novels 
4,now  people think historical romances  would n t necessarily wrong lumped harlequin romance genre  but well written historical romance hr future reference  beautiful thing  i never read hr sexual content  first comment i get i tell i m reading genre  the sexual content least interests   a well written hr explores much  it usually study period norms includes dress  habits  transport  architecture  literature  art  lifestyle  fashions  speech  vocabulary  historical facts characters loosely loosely based fiction  etc    julie garwood captures features characters ransom  she truly refreshing dashing knight princess in need of rescue theme    www ramblingsofbookworms blogspot com
2,i weakness julie garwood books  repurchased book kindle format buying original version many years ago  while formatting errors  gap content starting location  it appears several pages missing  extremely annoying  returning book 
4,i think favorite parts story involve different clans work together   i feel like never got see fabled buchanan spartans  though  bummer me sweet story half heroines half heroes  couple surprises highlanders  predictably  clueless feelings i think stories charming i perhaps need space reading n t feel similar still  good story  involving fun leaves  awww       finally      
3,this sequel the secret  pretty good i liked the secret  better  ransom  fast read ends bit abruptly  the author could developed ramsey s romance separate novel  that would justified charming personality a new reader would find novel neat read earlier novels like saving grace the secret  n t stand good chance 
3,i great fan julie garwood like books except this one  this book made really angry the heroine gillian backbone  how could know getting married  god s sake     and hero brodick push around lot  value opinions  did even ask wants marry  now stretching things little far but fair  plot book really good  and book stop reading garwood s books 
4,i always loved julie garwood s books always waiting something new  ransom best books  still good  she exceptional writer seems hard top s already done  the characters brodick gillian seemed missing something  they n t seem like well suited characters novels  i actually interested ramsey gillian really think deserved book  that would great story  i think 
5,it wonderful  i could hardly wait get home read  i thrilled find happend judith frances catherine  ms garwood favorite author  this truly ms garwoods finest books 
4,this actually two romances  although gillian brodick romance takes center stage  bridgid ramsey relationship develops margins  but n t mind like reader would liked little history  i would liked little detail period  the novel s real strength really moves along   really feel like adventure characters  while novels see predictable conclusion horizon  really keeps guessing  i really could n t guess things going  what fun  the characters likable  brodick wins compassion rough edges overall  enjoyable read i found hard put  i read well evening night   
4,i held completely enthralled first half book  loved setting s description  i loved heroine wee lad  took wing  my problems   n t enough love scenes  arrived late story   fact author decided throw another couple mix  without fully fleshing story  i think ms garwood stuck main protagonists left couple another book
4,ramsay sinclair brodick buchanon  make reappearance new novel heroes  both lairds  must discover plots harm ramsay s young brother  in process meet two remarkable women disrupt lives teach love  fun read  lot action  adventure ludicrous dialogue feisty women oh so stubborn suitors  book keeps turning pages  however   aside fact characters fall love quickly keep track  book great read exception weak ending  ms garwood  made women appear weak weepy  words far cry indomitable characters  a better attempt could made keep characters true form 
2,i looking forward reading another great book julie garwood  i got book flat characters n t make feel anything way books  maybe i n t read books n t expected much new i would liked book better  the bottom line i sick heriones getting lost sense direction  and wrings hands together i think i ll scream  miss garwood needs start give heros heriones new personalities stop share traits act alike  the reason i give star story  characters 
5,good story wish would continue another story line  love book next follow
2,this book harder get  i found little plodding contrived  the historical content language poor  i prefer read historical novels least attempt keep language characteristics time  this  i found gillian little weak succumbing brodick s wishes getting caught trouble whenever n t  some central characters  little boys initial start trouble gillian s sister christen  dealt satisfaction  it almost like created  forgotten brought back could wrapped up while i n t say bad book  somewhat disappointing  be prepared suspend belief get plodding moments manage enjoy book part  i n t 
1,beware    no text speech option  amazon wonderful refunded cost book  amazon great customer service  i contacted author publisher voice option matter 
3,i every book julie garwood ever written  i puzzled  sometimes  book  appears lost zest writing  using format wording prior stories  your price however  makes good buy  within novel learn old friends  works  it worth reading  i would n t rush pay full price second time 
5,i read books i think fantastic writer  ransom far best books  no body else compare  
5,ransom wonderful  a compelling plot characters life  i laughed i cried i laughed  garwood best weaving touching story  i highly recommend book 
4,gillian summoned murdered father child determine location stolen treasure  as tries find long lost sister may treasure  gillian turns scottish chieftain brodick  as tries help find treasure save uncle  unwittingly marries brodick  decided simply wants  tradition people well english born gillian  his strength bravery win  however  two england clear father s restore family s legacy this well spun  although highlanders little edgy rough  gillian keeps changing flimsy damsel distress fighting  serious wound enduring heroine  i liked pair many cohorts  not believable story many respects  entertaining 
1,if ve read anything else  n t get book  the information so general could applied anything  the book lists quick explanations happen  information respond ll experience  additionally  frightening statements book letting know author expert subject baby rearing  i exasperated read thought babies usually placed backseat car  i think everyone knows only place put baby car  though  i m afraid unknowledgeable people read book think s ok things put baby front seat car if ve read anything else  n t need book  in fact  n t read anything else  still n t need book  do n t waste time money 
3,i sorta expecting creamy smooth trippy ride  i got another  standard  frenchy hip hop comp  i loved dj cam stuff  kid loco somewhat along lines  kinda bored s predictability   you ll like n t heard enough french hip  trip  hop 
3,kid loco s fame based skills turntables  picked barely two years ago  production console  hence  amazing mixing skills latest volume excellent dj kicks  series  new kid loco pieces disappointing   the real virtue cd selection tempo tracks  underworld jazzanova  future pilot a k a bloomington s lisa germano  jazz post rock experimentation  kid loco s set s electronica genera 
3,although kid loco several great   singles good remixes person choose next dj kicks series  this cd offers fair overview ever evolving nujazz brokenbeat sound eminating british underground sadly skimming surface  although offer tasty musical morsels journey lead far previous contribution set example eclecticism theivery corporation  good buy casual beathead  if tastes require bit average fare aim innovative sounds jazznova compost records crew steal show collection top recent complilation future sounds of jazz vol  
4,i compare cross  kruder  dorfmeister vs dj cam s mixed cd   lil  theivery corp flavor  it n t surprise much   n t put sleep either   
3,this book looks zhensheng  propaganda soldier rolled cultural revolution  when i bought i thought look china used military information  particularly command information  case  it s still good book well illustrated great photos footnote cultural revolution anything else 
3,although kurt masur done fine job elevating new york philharmonic back first rank world renowned orchestras  far obvious  judging lackluster recording  these rimsky korsakov pieces played technical perfection  lack warmth enthusiasm i heard teldec recorded new york philharmonic performances  notably brahms symphony cycle dvorak sth symphony  only capriccio espagnol passionate performance  falls short definitive philips recording rotterdam philharmonic david zinman s baton  as scheherazade  compelling  definitive performances vienna philharmonic orchestra conducted either andre previn seiji ozawa  recorded philips  worth owning 
4,i agree valuable addition small library books working mothers  but heads  bound packet book  it photocopied type cover looks like printed standard laser printer double spaced times new roman font  publishers  someone work author get shiny new updated version please 
5,that cutest baby cover i ve ever seen whole life  it s time successful lawyer found way structure career around family 
3,great value money  supposed  if use polarizer alot photography get high hoya polarizer 
2,as child lived yakima valley  some summer afternoons father would buy vegetables japanese farmer  my father  normally outgoing  reserved deferrential  dad explained farmer successful engineer  lost everything forced go  camp   tragedy great waste  i ve haunted guiet farmer ever since  enthusiasm i began stubborn twig  story japanese family s american experience stubborn twig well researched chock full details yasui family  reading story compelling  it s  it s repetitious  tedious slow  difficult read  the last pages  third generation  mix biography sociologist psycho babble  so read stubborn twig  because s important story  american story much teach us  n t forgotten 
3,anticipated accounting japanese america time   had touched treatment i lived southern california time   preteen   experienced air raid sirens search lights   as well losing best friend concentration camp the book definitely historical accounting affect family   but i found overly discriptive repetitive style lacking stories   even little glimpses stores  orchards went higher education  guess i hoped would  my book club discussing tomorrow night home several echoed thoughts   should interesting discussion 
1,the subject matter interesting research obviously thorough reading another matter  i afraid i could n t keep making plow  it surprises oregon reads selection  you would truly determined reader already get endless detail absence warmth color writing 
4,enlightening book even though winner long run short term fluctuations large  great section bankroll requirements 
3,while reading book forces think  excellent  however i found annoayed mason s comments alot says semi controversial seems try make everything controversial  
2,unrelated stock footage  annoying repetitive sound effects galore  filler  inane sensationalized commentary  filler   floats boat give ridiculous excuse documentary video whirl  otherwise  avoid like plague 
2,this n t worth reading  sadly  the plot pretty well thought  dialogue characters really underdeveloped 
4,the story young christopher chant grows magic inheritance  to christopher landscape beyond bedroom leads multiple worlds seems normal  it takes time adults realise access worlds  longer still christopher understand barriers magic full extent powers  this book conceptually vast  yet fast paced adventure mystery fantasy story  i greatly enjoyed book  i read sitting  look forward reading rest series 
5,if fantasy  adventure  humor   read the lives christopher chant  i copy would highly reccomend everyone  if read book enjoyed  read witch week  charmed life  the magicians caprona  everything else written diana wynne jones 
1,i every workout like challenge  the workout i got video pushing fast forward button puts   minute break every set  there  workouts workout  minutes leave breaks  please waste money please  i sending back  i never ever done bad workout  it really ridiculous ever got released 
1,this dvd waste money  i brought dvd based  stars reviews  reviewers must lisa s friends associates  there instructions variations levels  the dvd says many reps beginners  intermediate  advance   cues levels  there consideration learning curve alternate ways certain routines  there way many breaks short workout routine  i purchases dvd intense workout home i unable go gym  invest another kettlebell workout  lisa making hand fist dvd buyers expense

3,i bought dvd reviews  i new kettlebell workouts i rely product reviews  i would agree great job instructing use kettlebell correctly important injury occur done improperly  that said  tone monotone pace quite slow  she  reps beginner n t allow time  i think max need stop rest  the rest periods way long i usually hop treadmill ab crunches  it good workout i think needs bumped excitable zone 
4,i viewed number kettlebell wo s  especially female instructors  most boring  aerobic nature use light bells  this instructional video beginning  emphasizing form always  i admit rest periods longer re using lighter bell weight ll thankful  she gives rundown beginning  intermediate advanced reps rest  it s way start program  doubt 
3,i m thrilled dvd  s instructional actual workout  good  i kettelbell beginner  moves explained well  i guess i expected something different  i ve bought the firm s workout instead  oh well  
1,i exercise dvd junkie years  kettlebell dvds  although i like exercises presented  i issues form  i know personal experience  n t form correct  cause injury parts body i knees  also  re advanced  working without instruction  beginner workout  normally  trainers either let beginners know time continue advanced exercisers  lisa stops working beginners level  leaves still working  hopefully  finishing time next exercise  i pick good exercises n t use dvd often i would liked  i sending  resell  road 
2,the title s great  cover great  instructions mostly great   there s mention time warm cool  grab kettlebell get i guess  the breaks exercises  weird  uninformative    well  i know enough   second break  yeah   minutes nothing timer   since breaks never addressed manner whatsoever  i see people set sitting would n t exactly healthy  i really wanted love  i think shortcomings outweigh good points  least  i m selling back amazon 
4,i drawn dvd title  it great workout  cardio strength  lisa communicated times check see i impressed lot  being new exercising  i sure expect workout  lisa s introduction properly use bells great workout  i started using lb  weight  even though recommends lbs  women  the workouts long enough feel  long interfere daily life  i impatiently awaiting second dvd  the thing negative i say i wish i would known weights recommended purchasing  overall  exercised great really work different muscles used regular free weights  there  workouts  upper  lower circuit leave feeling like i got great workout 
1,i purchased dvd hoping complete kettlebell workout  this video  she  different segments  workouts   you would  feel worked kettlebell  the exercises short repetitions breaks exercises way long  the instructor states really feeling cardio  i really bored feeling sweat cardio  save time money skip kettlebell dvd 
3,i got mail yesterday i super excited thinking going amazing previous posts  and overall  i guess  ok  three workouts row  i did i agree people complained resting  moves another two minute rest period   you begin feel like instructional video real workout begins  never happens 
1,i n t understand dvd n t released yet received many reviews all great  has dvd released elsewhere 
2,i n t expecting much i rented dvd blockbuster  i right to it takes place antarctica  none actors look like cold outside  cgi ridiculously cheesy  typical syfy movie   far many closeups actors  faces outside shots  clearly attempt conceal fact movie set  spoiler alert  worst  robot hitler  cgi imagine nothing happened movie surprised bit  clear see dominique swain s jake busey s careers circled drain least decade ago the reason i gave film two stars instead one premise film attracted  nazis trying restart third reich  insert place  it s good mindless laughs  other  n t waste time 
3,for remember  they saved hitler s brain    movie many ways far superior  good movie watch back turn brain pudding  i time time  the movie far far worse  abraham lincoln vs zombies   
1,what say movie  terrible  wooden  hack acting  bad uneven lighting  terrible cgi special effects  hitler s over acting head bad cgi robotic body  nazi ufo  hack job rip off ofiron sky frankly  special features   actually interesting movie  not re super interesting  but thee features pre production  cast  location main production  each   minutes long and s commentary track but special features hardly salvage stink burger overall  i ll rate pass   i might pick iron sky point see s better  what so ever  one hope  but general premise hokey begin  i m holding much hope either  o 
2,wow  truly many plot lines put single movie  we start creationth reich escaping ss troops scientists  then get zombie super troopers  forced abortion cure  nazi spaceship  robo hitler  etc   do n t pay   movie  includes shipping  it funny moments  many  the special effects n t bad  least n t rocket string fire cracker tail  the actors mostly supporting actors tossed leading roles  like co leading roles 
3,some cgi bit shabby  overall enjoyed  it portrayed horrors experiments humans quite well interesting ideas  i n t get bored watching beginning many suggested  i feel given s budget restraints fell short better  i definitely bought far worse good enough rewatch occasionally 
2,this dvd compilation short excerpts christmas themed veggietales videos  some  songs  n t even complete songs  portion another video singing  a lot cutting pasting different scenes together make  complete  song  not sure seconds musical number called song  portions seem simply cut mid sentence  there traditional christmas songs  sing a long  kids familiar previously released veggietales christmas videos  my daughter loves traditional veggietales videos lost interest within minutes  the dvd  traditional christmas songs simply play music scroll words across screen karaoke style still background  disappointed product veggietales 
5,love  i watching vt since college i m still love  my loves watching vt sing a longs car  perfect christmas season 
5,the gorgeous illustrations caught eye i picked book first time  what wonderful story  kipling way writing flows makes reading story loud pleasure hear words 
5,the book s focus carefully explaining quantum field theory  starting classical field theories  ie  harmonic chain  greiner goes discussnd quantization spin    spin fields  the results applied derive perturbation expansion interacting fields  the last sections quantization path integrals well written  contains details  sakurai  throughout  many  sometimes tedious   instructive examples presented lots authors assume understood already 
1,i deeply disappointed thoroughly frustrated perplexing redundant complications book  it true author  apart form fertile textbook writer  thorough approach comes derivations mathematical explanations  however   obscures physics contained  the author insists thorough mathematical explanation without reference intuition  making topic mathematical derivations physics  the mathematics complicated  tedious  he leave anything done reader  turning learning process effort understanding author thinks thinks understand topic 
4,well  looking synopsis series  look disk this probably faovrite animes  s time brought usa well important notes  this series dvds anime series dvds released every month  the doll comes set feminine features far accentuated  i think mile long legs great    mile long legs  just get regular dvd save spot 
1,i thought product would really handy camping  but owning couple days  i accidentally tipped took  the lantern would work  i sent away new bulb  fix problem this well thought product offers many handy features  unfortunately  typical black decker quality  n t expect last long even slightest jarring  it could nice emergency item case power blackout  i would recommend trying anywhere trip bound break 
5,i bought backup power company data center  it handy couple times works great  we used radio power utlity much features work well enough  i happy black decker lantern would recommend

4,first  i start  rita cockney  cockneys east end london  southeast  rita scouser  like the beatles  comes liverpool  northwest  just wanted clear  i watched english lesson school  walters caine give two finest performances respective careers  the story might predictable  s best things  anything willy russell gets vote  anyway  maureen lipman fab 
3,educating rita kick  wonderful performance julie walters heart  michael caine   perfectly cast poet long since turned bottle  watching two play another good fun  breathe life pat writing  when story wanders follow either character world  minor characters much less well rounded   she loutish cockney husband family  intellectual friends bring wine parties  surprised   if understand basic outline plot  cockney young woman trying raise charmingly spirited fashion  professor cups finds upstart refreshing  n t going surprised story goes  educating rita handle likely turns grace  though  lets concentrate appreciating acting  the movie s watchable good heart 
3,this movie features fine performances appealing characters  unfortunately  script mess  it begins promisingly story tough lower class girl comes educated previously bored literature professor  but peters  prof rita go separate ways soon  prof drunk tears writings hops plane australia i suppose meant happy ending even though nothing resolved  rita get educated  n t much fun happens re busy trying follow overlong  twisted screenplay  needed good rewrite

1,i read  jim boy  freshman english course summer reading thought horrible choice  it substance easy read  although apparently disagree  good choice anyone four years old 
3,well written sweet  rather slow  some characters somewhat difficult relate  rendering decisions actions puzzling 
4,jim the boy slight  sweet  told voice true childhood  perhaps important lesson word  father  countless meanings  important  while may exactly  great american novel   i enjoyed tony earley s simple story depression era southern boyhood immensely  it ageless appeal span generations  well done   tim bazzett  author love  war  polio reed city boy trilogy 
4,jim boy tony earley sweet novel set north carolina late s  unlike books set south recent memory  though  book n t describe abused young dysfunctional family rather great strength although jim s father matter days born  jim raised mother three uncles never married  throughout book   earn livelihood farming  teach jim life s greatest lessons  from learning field confronting firends devestating illness seeing grandfather never knew old lays dying  readers journey along jim experiences life tenth eleventh birthday reminiscent equally lyrical style found plainsong kent haruf  book pleasant read summer s day 
5,this book spiritual nourishment young soul  it patiently impeccably crafted fine piece simple furniture  made without glue  nails  embellishment  smooth beautiful without false unnecessary move  very authors today restraint  finesse  wisdom 
5,this book restore human heart andantimaterialism polemical works world  it isabout dignity faith  sure hand  deceptively simple  buy  treasure  share  
4,the readers call children s fiction  missing point  novel homage books  like the yearling   remind us life good  counters trend life as angst  remember reading novels made feel good  probably since grade school  right  this book n t kids  d miss symbolism subtlety  remond loved reading first place  even cover art made smile 
5,tony early tells story jim straight forward simplicity forget  fact  reading book  you feel heat sun boy s shoulders spends day uncles corn field  feel yearning know father died week born  i could go  i n t top early  go read book  i doubt i ll read better year 
1,for reason i thought novel adults although retrospect looking cover told otherwise  set south  north carolina  story jim never knew father  the guy died heart attack  widow remained faithful  never considering remarriage  however  jim love support three unmarried  bachelor   uncles  they live farm  sort coming of age story  quite possibly adolescents might like  but dull  dull read 
5,probably better short character novels written recent time mr  early caught feelings  time people part nc way  i think  ever done  the wonderful relationships boy  mother uncles close truly caring family could ever be read book 
3,so book took day read  awesome i n t lot time month  it simple story i m sure discuss book club  i guess ll see  worth read  definately g rated read kids 
1,this book recommended co worker  i often love read recommendations others  experience i cautious  this book quite simply boring books i ve ever read  its simple minded prose irritated point distraction  i grateful distraction though  prose mind numbing  the chapters could well titled   jim almost meets ty cobb     jim climbs a tree     jim gets a baseball bat   titles would sum every piece action contained  the characters lifeless virtually indistinguishable 
1,jim boy terribly overrated  cast cardboard characters wooden tone  apparently many critics n t know distinguish spare  basic prose dumbed down bad writing  the author probably laughing way bank  especially sequel published  i ll let fall pass  god forbid movie forthcoming 
3,i bought book part book of the month club started read put pages thinking i could never make  then days later i picked finished  it slowest reads i ever read horrible ending  it sort ends much told  but reedeming quality relationships jim relatives  if would received star 
1,this like first try writing  over used plot  short chapters  small vocabulary  typical charachters  this book shows writing skills whatsoever  look title   jim boy   very original yet dialogues freaked       jim said      uncle coran said      said jim      uncle zeno said the word  said  probably greatest number synonyms  earley never used word the plot  oh sweet  typical plot i seen many times  nothing special  no twists  a plain  dull  stupid plot  just another boy without parent depression i n t even say much book  s nothing  if i n t read book school  i would never read beyongth page 
1,this novel might ok children  grown ups s overly idealized  put mildly  fantasy depression era southern life  i kept expecting andy opie walking  carrying fishing poles  least something funny might happened  way  but earnest  plodding book unbelievably good world actually kind insult way southern people really liveds  black white  what author thinking 
3,a big fan tony earley s short stories  i could hardly wait first novel  but i disappointed  though certainly fine book  felt little thin  like stringing together short stories novel  even  pleasant read  and i like tony earley much i feel terrible giving better review  i sure next book awesome 
4,jim boy tony earley wonderful novel   beautifully written  poetic without overblown contrived  without preachy  i recommend highly 
3,  jim boy  alright read however i think i expecting something written adults i felt book geared towards adolescents adult readers  it really good story line  however  n t really make brain work much reading  what i really liked book simplistic lifestyle described  somewhat similar late grandfather  so  nice little fictional peak like grandfather growing time period 
3,jim boy highly recommended i could n t wait read  unfortunately i felt i gone fine restaurant eat gourmet meal discovered fast food plate  there certainly moments made reading book worthwhile i came away hungry 
2,this pleasant  rather hokey coming of age seems addressed kids  grownups  i n t understand n t marketed children s book  really little hold adult reader s interest  the plot familiar sentimental  writing clear  uncluttered  plain interesting right  buy school age  father 
3,i appreciate tony earley s craft  simple  yet keen prose  masterfully guided  yet  jim boy novel lofty  sentimentalized ideals outweigh ultimately obscure characters  what resonated reading book unrecognizable jim real boy 
4,life great depression harsh  we see eyes ten year old  boy  jim  yet simplistic rigors farm life lend strength  discipline  tenacity little boy coming age aliceville  north carolina  his widowed mother three endearing uncles help jim turning points life courage  the illness friend  coming electricity  marriage proposal mother receives expands world  adventures different local begin anew  through eyes  remember children  easily identify perceptions  touching engaging

3,touted  the greatest dectective story ever written   tangled story unraveling mysterious death richard iii s nephews  do i  i n t think 
2,for like english history twist mystery love novella  the daughter of time josephine tey  this mystery novel deals lot english history old kings stuff  whic something i n t mesh  on scale ten i would rate book three  the reading bit hard  i often found counting pages i finished  though i usually love mystery  definitely disappointment countless levels  the book written well i think i tad bit older wiser english history i may enjoyed  overall i think i would personally give book two thumbs 
3,this book assigned class part summer assignment  my teacher assigned book illustrate history distorted teach us interpret historical documents textbooks  i felt fictional aspect extremely boring repetitive 
3,this book clever well written  i first read age sixteen i found totally convincing  yes  yes  course richard nice  course innocent  it n t year later i read real history books subject i realised book sound history  a bedridden police inspector decides richard must innocent likes  that seems extremely dangerous supposition start  if possible tell person guilty innocent merely looking  could away trial jury altogethere  yes  m lud  s innocent  look   richard iii usurped throne nephews  imprisoned tower  happened dissapear  whoops  mislaid  just coincidence i n t think  read the princes tower  alison weir re interested learning  probably  really happened 
3,it unique idea digging historical crime accused murderer king richard discovering truth factual records reports people living time well written personally i could n t work lot enthusiasm it honestly  americans passing familiarity english royalty even less interwoven families unless familiar people care book becomes tedious quickly now whether george washington really chopped cherry tree whether really wheeping willow cousin framed arborcide maybe i could worked interest i n t mean belittle murder princes n t parallel crime history i could compared to so unless british history buff i would give pass 
2,well written  boring containing bad conclusions  the whole story hinges laid up detective thinking painting someone s makes look innocent murder  what   come  give agatha christie 
3,as early modern historian  well  student history  i give book  stars  but reader  i give five stars  my first year university dominated studies the wars roses richard iii  english history  a friend gave copy ms tey s book got thinking bad rap richard iii got  i since delved deeper mystery  least far resources university western australia s library allow   lot fantastic collection history resources   decided richard iii n t as bad made  the daughter time entertaining thought provoking fiction  i reccommend amatuer historians  it opens eyes bias history 
5,i read  the daughter time  adolescent  joined richard iii society twenties  wandered around bosworth field thirty  found derek jacobi s recording book last year listened many times since  hearing well narrated book previously embraced reading unique pleasure  the opposite loving book  hating movie  i sorry derek jacobi recorded inspector grant single book  his inspector grant much different stephen thorne s  could never mistaken  stephen thorne s brilliant 
3,this n t much novel  author s characters flat interchangeable  pale point invisibility beside information provided richard iii  richard reason read book  forget novel  read document exploring history richard iii possible interpretations historical records king s reign  just n t expect anyone book richard iii  follow plot  s none  but  s still worth reading re history buff  especially interested richard iii 
3,interesting historical review nasty legend associated richard  told eyes recuperating detective hospital  a bit complex places  overall succeeds well rehabilitating richard 
5,do n t know i missed josephine tey years  this unusual  well written mystery  very definitely work time  adam grant detective time place  but well worth read 
5,i particular fan history british monarchy mysteries   daughter time  intensely intellectual read  albeit fiction  this story passive reader  randomly visits different points time   present  past invokes series questions ultimatley never answered  the intiguing element supposition history s account king richard iii flawed  either purposeful acts opposed  mere consequence events   daughter time  quite difficult follow times best read fully alert  nice hot tea coffee help  not recommended junior readers unless mystery forte   story severely lacking action although quite adventurous  see unravel mystery  possible  read  spring moon  bette bao lord refreshing look opposite world political spectrum 
3,i read book recently second time mystery discussion group hoping find better second time around  the characters enjoyable story earth shattering book s reputation leads believe  i trying another book author i enjoy style  can someone tell called  the daughter time   
4,dynamic uncomplicated story keeps unraveling speed avalanche set unexpected surroundings  hospital   story evolves around investigationand subsequent discovery true reason behind murders two princes the writing style engaging  full interesting fact witty comedic nuances make oblivious time takes finish book  the author gets heart matter without painting unnecessary surroundings  it s well written  entertaining book i recommend afternoon kill by simon cleveland
3,this  mystery  story involves debunking bad reputation king richard iii england  the writing  set up  characters awkward believable  but  evidence  king richard iii unfairly maligned history  especially thomas more william shakespeare  becomes compelling spite serious shortcomings novel  the recent discovery consider remains real richard iii makes story much interesting would otherwise  i found delving english history researching richard iii society  members arguing richard deserves rehabilitated  for reason alone  novel worth reading 
5,this   must reads entire history detective fiction  it s book responsible popularizing revisionist narrative life richard iii  and s insightful study way history recorded suit interests prejudices historians  including  sainted thomas more   taken woodshed 
5,i marginal interest richard iii book compelling drawn search richard got reputation i fan josephine tey  late  richard  unusual detective story characters well differentiated read 
3,this novel apparently well loved although s clever  s certainly great  first  unless re fan british history  ll hate novel  if like action mysteries  ll hate novel  it s intellectual s mystery tey good writer novel best 
4,i ordered two copies daughter time gifts  they arrived promptly good condition 
4,i think readers knowledgeable british history even fun reading book  although i confuse richards  edwards elizabeths lords ladies  i still think wonderful story  the case convincingly presented  i even vivid dream i arguing richard iii s innoncence 
3,an enjoyable book  i m sure i would liked even i working knowledge english history  the story based around solving mystery  murders attributed richard iii  it easy engaging read 
5,could n t resist simon  garfunkel reference this easily best mysteries i ever read  believe i lot reading  while admittedly sometimes gets little difficult follow times  i found whole premise different intriguing mysteries i read kept going  my first thought surprising authors n t really tried duplicate type story  i think anything would short  it s like hollywood trying remake classics follow storyline  never works   there  it s wonderful life    daughter time   i looking forward reading another tey novel 
1,i found book historically inacurate books wars roses ever written  tey uses shield  historical fiction  writes dabbler history period  without serious consideration key players  she maligns good reputation sir thomas more  makes ridiculous assumptions motives stand close academic scrutiny  in addition bases detectives entire investigation portrait totally unauthenticated  i found dismissal historians offensive overall lack scholarship depressing  read book must  go get alison weir s  the princes tower  accurate view period 
1,the pro richard effluvium getting rather overwhelming  think actually history book  i ll recommend another book real scholar  the princes tower  alison weir 
1,i great difficulties years reading book  after finally reading cover cover  opinion improved  chief virtue length  mercifully short   it mostly boring interest chiefly students famous tower london murders  analyzes   this book owes reputation chiefly rave review greatest mystery genre reviewers  late anthony boucher  gave  for  i dissented greatly 
2,the overrated book mystery genre attempt fuse mystery genre history genre  the mixture work  and tey s conclusions date 
1,almost one half way so called mystery  i put  perhaps british whether richard iii killed nephews  there seems engaging historical mysteries  and use research device tell mystery  it simply work  perhaps could written history book instead  i n t get  also  i doubt i read anything else tey 
1,this book required summer reading book  it seemed like took entire summer finish  it took long time get  i confused many times novel  not recommended unless re challenge 
1,this book boring book i ever read  i mean  see guy broken leg  s trying solve mystery occurs decades ago  what s point 
3,patience virtue  and ll need quite large amount re read book  for first pages  story rather slow majority time  true  interesting bits  short  however  first pages   re history buff  re quite ride  ms tey explores every aspect richard iii s case murder two nephews  her reccuring theme fallibility evidence persecution innocence strongly present novel  includes rather  quirky  ending less  straightforward  readers quite enjoy 
5,different approach might happend castle richard iii ruled england you become detective conclusions  i looked books richard iii ever since josephine tey introduced  thank j t   
3,i m ricardian  i n t think richard nephews  neither i think book classic  it rather simple premise  tey seems completely set upon raising richard iii sort divine pedestal  the guy flaws  he responsible beheading people  king  he favorite characters history  tey tries    falls flat  carradine got nerves well  sorry if admittedly romanticized  far interesting  book richard iii  i would wholeheartedly suggest  the sunne splendour   it finely crafted novel sharon kay penman goes show indeed possible richard iii brute will shakespeare makes  penman stays well within historical boundaries  reasearch almost without boundaries  
4,this book recommended family discussion whether richard iii guilty killing two nephews  i expected book biography  presented fiction form inspector student looking mystery richard iii inspector bedridden  the dialogue book inspector student  research british museum  the student brings research information back bedridden inspector  there good points made book casts doubt general history s portrait richard iii evil uncle  although book well written make interesting points  i help wonder whether information fiction way tey presented story  tey shows alternate theories may happened princes tower 
1,this book worst book    shakespeare    ever read high school career  it goes murder really n t matter guy n t even get bed 
5,the format  whodunnit  admirably suited josephine tey s critical look reign richard iii  ambition henry vii  fact s winner writes history comes accepted fact  whether  indeed  factual  this book excellent companion read thomas more s  history richard iii   puts new term working vocabulary   tonypandy    shows thomas more  intended  interest future employment henry vii life henry viii  too bad image richard iii cover image described book  would better put new cover edition   s objection

1,update   hp sent replacement printer charge  my printer thing many others reported   worked fine stopped feeding paper  it seems clear  carefully inspecting poking without disassembling  roller initially feeds paper n t apply enough pressure  i kept thinking something must broken  i think bad design hp something  my plan call  point dozens dozens complaints on line urge replace darn thing something works 
1,after month  paper lift tray  hp knows problem i called service  they showed clean paper puller wheel  it works  a little dust  wheel gets traction  stay away printer 
1,it looks great  lcd screen media card slots nice touch but good n t paper print any thing out   i able get paper using exclusive hp paperand one paper time works some times my first hp printer last  i run ink darn thing  rather thanburning bucks ink i would buy lexmark 
3,this is an old review may may valid today  i now recommend install drivers machine select custom installation deselect drivers best results  it requires sometimes clean ink resevoir area distilled water since old ink builds lumps  the ink seems water soluble best use water alcohol clean ink installing new cartridges  hp like usa high tech industrial places seem much control instead installing really need try install everything  the internet stuff machine aggressive would always cause troubles i learned install drivers must select custom installation right start given choices but i still say much manipulation going us ignoramouses 
1,i use recommended paper machine couple weeks began noticing problem printing  everytime i print page  machine fails feed paper  i manually hold paper machine grab pull print  it s waste time waste money

3,classic  s really funny way combined cartoons people believably really cool  you see
1,the dvd used revealed broken would play displeasing  they rerun item never shipped working dvd
1,i ordered video granddaughter  movies ordered amazon i never knew could view region   i guess i lucky odering videos  i never knew region   i upset i n t even return video  you people sell videos able watched dvd players waste time money  i sure i buy videos amazon i faithful customer 
4,yep  i m cartoon fanatic  especially depicted hanna barbera filmation rankin bass simpsons what said  film lot cartoon lover  bugs bunny mickey mouse actually scene  a comic duel donald daffy duck  looney tunes meets disney crew  this animationphile s dream true  however  character roger way silly  stupid  lacking appeal  imagine jerry lewis cartoon rabbit get idea  a bit overdone aspect  but business jessica rabbit amusing well robert hoskins character  interacts quite well cartoons no mean feat actor  overall  s moments  cartoon freaks love ending   kind thing i watch twice 
1,this favorite movies ever  s moment i n t believe toons humans interacting   version censored version film  they cut parts without consent director  reason  i beg buy version  wait correct bowdlerization masterpiece
2,i loved film ever since first made  dvd really justice despite called special edition   contains single extra feature  the widescreen format anamorphic  means mpeg aspect ratio   picture resolution viewable area lower  the quality film print used poor contains scratches white speckling  the film bits edited  i suppose could say contains negative number special features  i e  normal features taken  this shocking misuse format dvd standard contains possibility optional scenes shielded young viewers  n t used  i doubt long next version comes  collector s special edition  whatever call  advice would wait 
1,as reviewers noted  ground breaking  hilarious  one of a kind movie  it deserves everyone s dvd collection  even collection consists two dvds  it deserves five  even six  stars    i urge wait another dvd version  two reasons  first  ever film deserved extras  s who framed roger rabbit   get none over priced dvd  second  movie trimmed scant seconds  grounds poor taste offending scenes   critical thing  it is censored  strike small blow ability decide  avoid dvd  wait   ll show unadulterated version point near future 
1,caveat emptor  dvd release contains censored version movie  different previous laserdisc vhs releases  it apparently altered without director s approval 
4,i huge fan roger rabbit  it great ordering products company  not i get piece still origional stuff inside  i definately order company again  thank

4,this movie timeless classic  jessica rabbit still hottest actress cinama day  excluding alyson hannigan linda cardellini  christopher lloyde shows true gritt 
5,this dvd enjoyed movie came nearly years ago  it offers inside story behind scenes production animation  it bad n t make sequel roger rabbit  bob hoskins wonderful film  still  good entertainment everyone 
3,the content film question  its blend live action animation unprecedented day   space jam  p p p please   while plot choppy cliche  acting animation direction  animation great richard willaims  makes great film the dvd much desired film notes  director s commentary  trailers  i especially hoping see deleted scene eddie valiant breaks jessica s dressing room get knocked bouncer early dreadful encounter toontown shown cbs airing film  animation edited redone several places  disney really needs realize truly film gem stop placing back burners achievements  its truly innovative anything ve done recent years fell formula saccharine characterization 
3,this disk formatted sort way play  american  dvd players  was n t aware fact i purchased i least able view macbook  still good quality disk  i ll hang  it childhood favs 
3,one film s adult moments jessica rabbit cut eisner s disney battle make empty uncontroversial familial fluff  it shocking scene made film seriously   anymore  i could see taking kid s version mentioned  enthusiast s disc edited  thanks lot disney  learn play scissors   history i appreciate getting full wide screen package  they given deleted scenes  brought back original frames full scenes  like customers expect  it s like since vhs release   extras crammed onto disc anyway  beyond  great dvd fine extras  you may wait better edition deleted scenes  
3,as probably know  who framed roger rabbit  great movie  unfortunately  dvd version offers zero extras  no cut scenes  no feature commentary  no making  featurette  and no trailer  back cover clearly states trailer disc   is n t kind law blatant false advertising  the picture sound quality good  owners dvd players deserve bare bones copy movie  especially s cinematic special effects achievement caliber 
3,the bottom line  the special effects nifty i guess chinatown esque plot kinda fun  gimmick ran stale first half hour i wanted bit fall back hoskins  growling christopher lloyd s scenery chewing  i see everyone else loves  i especially enthused 
3,movie great loved minutes image bad

3,i bought book intention developing solid  base  understanding ancient egyptian history  in respect  i  part  disappointed  if already basic understanding topic  good book quick  review    s bit stuffy lay person starting  it s short excitement  long dry facts  i like feel like  armchair indiana jones  i read history books  book n t much convey feeling 
2,the egyptians  ancient peoples places  reference using pictures drawings  it almost cyril n t put effort book  slap history could find  he skipped many things put basics  yet good guide basic knowledge monuments  kings  good place find ancient cities egypt 
3,pros  attractive color pretty much described fit old chairs cons  the material sturdy  the cloth pockets butterfly chair iron inserts cover double thickness i expect hold well  i weigh pounds i sat chair  cover stretched sagged 
1,whatever  the demonstrating slightest amount talent singer  used o l d along bass player plotkin  they stuck knew  the singing shrieking best described excrutiating  music redeeming features  i ve nothing detuning detuning far makes guitar sound poorly tuned badly played  to s extreme extreme s sake  like making sound plain crap primary objective  mission accomplished   
1,this bootleg  there legal releases much better sound quality  buy grooving kingston  hip o records   completer wailers parts    jad records  african herbsman  trojan records  instead 
4,race mars hard categorize  i would describe science based drama it presents scenario promising ideas technologies successful expedition mars played 
4,i loved realistic  almost documentary  movie  i liked way production joinned together sort problems could spected crew  i recomend 
4,naked apes pond life best shriekback project since oil gold far better crafted dancing years sacred city  though barry andrews martyn barker two original shriekers carl marsh dave andrews much missed since bowing oil gold  exciting  melodic  deeply textured multirhythmic return form  missed ardent casual shriekback fan  definitely worth splurging import  s unlikely ever domestic  all time best  jam science  never released cd  hello  is anyone working

3,  super mario bros   may little video game  lot fun  bob hoskins john leguizamo play mario luigi respectively  they re brooklyn plumbers stumble upon parallel universe containing evolved versions dinosaurs  the leader new dimension koopa  played charisma dennis hopper  koopa search meteorite piece merge two dimensions allow rule earth  this enjoyable film part  though disappointments  biggest s almost nothing like game  but contains quite laughs good moments pleasure kids  while dvd contains special features  makes great collectible item 
3,for game fans  movie  bob hoskins firm hero tries best  but movie far left field  for movie fan funny way looking things  
2,just stick video games  whether old new  this film fails many levels  s exciting engaging real video game  s smart entertaining film  not even dennis hopper save  fans original super mario bros definitely disappointed lack excitement  lack real connection game film  as matter fact  n t even look like actual mario brothers adaptation  many things movie connected original games   it looks like completely different fantasy film elements video games added  i never actually played super mario bros i n t exactly hate film  but still  entire movie flat  dull  uninteresting  if absolutely love nintendo  stay away super mario bros movie  nothing film works grade  d
1,ok  i m going get movie s lack similarities video games  movie plain sucks  i n t see anybody age twelve enjoy piece know  come  movie horrible acting  dreadfully bad story  hilariously  unfunny jokes  i think people gave movie five stars really need professional help  cause star far generous  i m saying media incarnations mario sucked  cartoons actually pretty good  but movie  opinion caused chain cartoons 
1,this movie screwed kind ways it even like video game even cartoon for example  king kopa look like supposed storyline seem like written  year old i wonder director drugs making called movie to people didnt see movie  need regret it its bad perfect shown mst3k 
5,i use film recorded vidio recorded regreting  i bought dvd  the quality exellent widescreen s shame s dvd extra s s stil class film time favourates  it s based video game mario luigi tryinhg save princess daisy another dimention diosaurs still alive trying get back earth  i m glad yoshi  it reminds game super mario world it s well worth getting mario fan

4,this movie rock solid    better games   this movie worth buying buy today else ll suffer cutsie princess movies 
1,some video game movies great  others horrid  super mario brothers goes beyond horrid  it seems though nothing thought writing script movie resemble game nintendo anyway  if slapped different changed names characters i think movie could received  stars rather  there nothing value movie i strongly suggest stay far away unless looking something put sleep insomnia 
1,how much dennis hopper get paid appear stinkbomb   i really respected dennis hopper  space truckers  im surprised made pos  if asking  movie n t that bad     m telling you yes it can    it probably worse even imagine  happened capt lou  i know garbage  bob hoskin s career went right toilet   where this tape belongs   ps  wonder s print   no one wanted it  
1,this mario i thought would good i   wrong  very wrong 
3,this cute fun movie came still  a great movie watch kids simply enjoy rewatching adults 
3,forgetting  nothing like games  actually ok movie  the best part little tiney walking bob omb movie  it really stole scene  but watch movie wacky plumbers make way dimension dinosaur creatures   the movie need see  it s best vidoe gmae movies actually  amongst horrible  street fighter  tomb raider  mortal kombat movies  
3,well  start  i confess i bad movie officionado  watching bad movies beloved hobby  so i heard mario bros live action movie dvd  i decided give shot  i bought copy  popped dvd player sat back my first impression movie would painful  very painful  however  film progressed  i realized acting good  special effects convincing enough  storyline    fun  it n t braveheart  far worse films  worse live action video game conversions  at worst  s watchable  at best  ll laughing 
4,not much i say except movie often riffed wrong reasons yes  movie indeed flawed many respects  but time  lot great set pieces  music  good dialogue  good cg animatronics  scene using joe satroni music it s fun movie  worth riffing hate  fun movie appreciate exactly supposed  fun ride 
3,my children  boy girl   got hooked super mario wii s super mario galaxy i bought movie surprise  they loved liked see yoshi characters imagined  they watched  do n t get wrong  considered good movie adults stretch imagination watch kids see eyes  worth time investment  good fun 
3,it has some action it s very adventurous and fun to watch the two actors play the perfect part for this movie buy this movie 
3,i think people really expect go watch movie large video game connection  sadly little  but i admit film still fun watch  s time special effects n t bad 
3,the plot strange yet interesting  mario louigi powers  jump wear special shoes 
3,at movie daisy says ll never believe  well leave us hangin happened make another movie  if never advertised  what going 
2,the following excerpted actual interview bob hoskins  star super mario bros  guardian   so  s worst job ve done   hoskins   super mario bros   guardian   what biggest disappointment   hoskins   super mario bros   guardian   if could edit past  would change   hoskins   i would n t super mario bros   do n t mince words  bob   really feel super mario bros  
2,i saw movie last night impressed  i m going say n t  realistic    s meant  i mean  jeez  look game  i say i wish common game   much changed  opinion  luigi young guy  moustache    toad kind hippie  goombas shrunken head dinos  i suppose people would expect things similar original  like d expect movie based book similar  i got impression writer director really n t familiar game  maybe s many changes  in case  always tough story media another  seems efforts often fall short mark 
1,i big fan super mario brothers  video game tv show  i high hope movie  boy waste time  this movie sure give super mario brothers bad  if n t seen movie  i envy  nothing like game show  it never made  period 
5,i liked movie quite bit  i felt funny  special effects quite nice  it doens t deserve bad reviews s getting  i highly recommmend 
3,i recently saw movie first time  verys  full faces recognize  unique extreme  weird  entertaining 
3,let s facts s weird moments continual adaptations games tv shows common trend much  the exception adaptations lot looser in case  super mario bros makes unique adjustment stretches game series different world tone  given s since i ve seen watching first time  i find movie fairly decent character moments  time  i find wondering mixed concepts game together came this it s best movie world  s fun 
3,i like this movie alot   its fun  funny  and so old school    well like as old school as i can get  its great for kids or people who like stupid funny or dig the nintendo era 
3,i actually liked film found fairly entertaining  i know going go watch film says mario  well except names  film relation mario whatsoever  but general film pretty entertaining bit cheesy dont expect much depth film seems targeted towards young children  so i give zero stars mario material  stars rest film  i recommend renting film rather buying 
1, m gunna lie  good movie  game titles would made much better story  if chose kirby  maybe  could made million jokes wierd blob evil penguin  could action dark matter battle  make movie  instead dumb mario movies  kirby king dedede beat mario luigi mile 
1,there nothing good i say movie there absolutely nothing remotely entertaining it if main characters n t go names mario  luigi  d lost nothing resembles video game s based  n t bad thing neccessarily     except nothing resembles kind story the acting bad  perhaps purpose     cares  it s amusing slightest the movie boring  in minutes  ll gouge eyes   super mario bros    movie  proven damage brain cells upon viewing in koopa shell  n t waste time movie  do n t even look cover  do n t even read review  just try pretend  movie  n t exist 
4,i know people dislike video game movies  especially old video game movies  smb much fun pass  all characters hilarious special effects pretty good old movie  the continuity plot well done well  bunch special effects gun shots i remember watching movie first time i seven eight loving  when i saw dvd years later i knew i buy  i still laugh whole time  for someone grew game revoltion  i still original nintendo system  movie nostaglic funny  i really recommend 
4,why people absolutely clobbering movie  i n t know  as guess  i would say title makes think video games  aboslutely nothing like video games  warned outset  however  unlike many others  get around fact completely ordinary mario universe  ll rewarded find great movie quite interesting story  i dock star expectations issue  this business  mario bros   title  otherwise highly recommended  
3,well seem see peopel witwhe love hate first saw disney channel    years agothe key thsi movie games muchits got sucky effectsits director problay drugsand id like add aperfect b movie style movieit doenst games justice  games storyline sav eteh princess  dont get wrong tehre kick ass gamesbut movie speacil kind drunken charm dont knock rented stolen lol
3,i got say though movie n t anything artistic value  certainly good movie watch  i ve witness every super mario bros piece merchandising entertainment ever  seeing movie seeing related games realistic setting really intriguing  right i m looking good place buy 
1,this movie typifies lazy  expensive  misguided hollywood misfires last years  bargain blade runner with more neon sets  poorly realized characters jarring tonal shifts  is kids  is adults  a comedy  thriller  sci fi  who knows  who cares   even completely ignore video game origins  movie fouls miserably   movie work intelligible entertainment  the movie feels like poorly directed stage play  everyone pitching last row  campy quotable enough memorable for think overlooked gem  i direct climax  koopa basically stands spot walkway minutes  clichéd  cartoonish  action  unfolds recycled sets around him another movie tries everything succeeds boring mildly nauseating  only watch sheer curiosity 
3,i may video game lover  i love movie  this far not best video game based movie  i enjoyed  mostly see i point dumbest  corny parts plot onscreen  i loved  still love  original super mario bros game nes  movie sort mockery  the weak plot impressive cast n t work  it may great stars  namely bob hoskins   even great actor could n t save movie   bad  a little funny  definately corny  first time see  probably n t hold anyone s interest long  a better video game turned movie would tomb raider  final fantasy  the wizard  like super mario  n t disappoint buying movie  just play game 
5,this fraken amazingi nearly fillied daiper heard song anesthetizeamazingly filmed awesome sound best prog rock dvd i seencheerskev

3,i enjoyed  in the heart of the sea  pages  first   book basic stranded survival story  once survivors rescued  philbrick loses storytelling ability  characters stumble confusing mismash  even philbrick s writing gets worse last pages  several sentences towards book simply incomprehensible 
5,this compelling story kept interested last page  nathanial philbrick told i ever wanted know whaling earlyth century tragedy essex  the actual sinking ship sperm whale stunning enough  survival crew members even remarkable  i would recommend book anyone

1,it s intriguing  the scriptures us really n t accurate maybe rethink christian really means  however  book uses little substantiation assertions  preferring  evidently  controversial rather thoughtful  if really questions  holy  bible  please read bart d ehrman s misquoting jesus  the author s creditials real  proofs relatively clear  message useable  the bible human document application lives  my advice  continue seeker truth   n t bother buying book

2,this film shot beautifully i liked way actors allowed meander around character sort  make movie  went along  unfortunately movie made  about    last days  kurt cobain  this movie accurate falls short paying any kind tribute memory kurt  it distorts memory thing sad  i enjoy quiet scenes mood shots  s neat reflective film actually comedic times away reference might kurt cobain  i mute volume scene character tries sing play like kurt  other  like i said i like way film shot made would enjoyed something supposedly kurt cobain  any way  s i say 
1,i say i pretty big kurt fan  i excited movie came i felt might actually pretty good  the good thing i say movie actor looked semi like kurt  thats   it def  bummer i pull   i really cant understand cant leave alone   hes great artist great band  the legend left rest peace   kurt s probably turning grave  if ever read anything would know would wanted   all word  waste money time  
1,this movie horrible  do n t waste money buying even renting  come   minutes staring something  nothing  or  minutes watching grass blowing wind  art  sucked horribly 
1,absolute worst movie i ever seen  i never write movie reviews bad hopelessly boring i felt obligated say something     heres movie  guy stumbles around house mumbling dress shotgun   treated full boyz2men video tv   guy stumbles around sits greenhouse mumble mumble   silence camera focused bush  mins   guys drunk friends house guy plays song  guys kiss lay eachother bed   guy makes mac cheese   guy greenhouse    awesome movie   makes watch dude wheres car
1,this movie poor  very poor  it seems like art student got ahold idea movie kurt   went town  idea  this movie no dialog  i kid  no dialog  i understand trying   show  strife    pain  kurt went addiction  movie draws hours   plot  and kurt cobain novice idea hell going movie 
1,this movie worst boring movie michael pitt s i seen  the story totally dull boring hardly serious sensible dialogue  only strange shots pitt alone talking interacting minute two characters  there hardly suspense spice movie  just downright boring  do waste money time flick  ai n t worth  pitt done much better roles  best work  funny games 
1,this movie seems like exploitation idea kurt cobain s last days may like  in  boring  long  slow  completely ridiculous 
2,unfortunately supposed inspiration last days kurt cobains life  leave jackass sold everything kurt cobain n t  let alone story told someone never  merely movie someone watched  the doors  many times  what waste  another person selling mighty dollar trying make film career  i d recommend buying album nirvana know true singer shadows 
4,welllll  i say this movie  different   good  different  if true kurt cobain nirvana fan  ll learn appreciate  it hurts see kurt might gone   i hope not   movie  quiet   he doenst say much  the  song  scene  emotional part  pitt definately played good role   i recommend you watch it only re true fan  otherwise  dont waste time  wont find interesting 
1,one worst films i ve ever misfortune sitting  actually i turned hour   i n t know i waited long  kurt interesting enigmatic person  movie made pay respect give something behind the scenes look  this movie basically shows kurt wasted heroin addict nothing offer say  lazy film making  terrible camera work  seriously rent movie reading review blame  literally worst movies ever wasted film 
2,sadly  gus van sant stopped directing movies  instead become supervisor filming  in dvd supplemental documentary  cast goes wonderful get creative work without script  they rave much loved improvisation great creating work art  in  n t create anything nauseating bore i turned subtitles i could understand  blake  muttering  n t worth reading i turned back   the film tries offer insight kurt cobain like character i fail see watching make macaroni cheese crawl around floor five minutes mumble unitelligable monologues offers audience anything  get over yourself gus start making real films instead trying pass garbage art  
1,bad movie   watch ll dissapointed   buy ll wasting money  if recommend anti christ 
4,i live seattle i cant see anyone could ever talk crap dear ol kurt put  he nicest guy cared people himself i saw nirvana concert oct phx  az i used live i saw kurt play sing perfect without flaw it hurts anyone could ever talk kurt like nothing rated  where hell fool  nirvana changed whole world ther say talent if wasnt nirvana  kurt ther would lame bandwagon pearl jam 
2,i caught movie ago playing still playing theater  i saddened dissapointing turned  i m sorry  michael pitt wrong choice play kurt cobain  even inspired famous late musician   the trouble  i n t think anyone could really play kurt  i suppose people movie  kim gordan sonic youth director gus van sant  actually knew kurt alive  know something i n t obviously  regardless mis casting  opinion  film terribly slow ultimately kind pointless  we already know s going  like  elephant   director asks keep attention spans going satisfy obsession real life tragic outcomes  i admire van sant s lofty goal create piece cinema attribute hero kurt  falls short 
2,i n t make mind  awful movie watch  reality probably quite close truth last days kill likely  there suprises  meaningful insights  if gus van sant trying guess last days addicted  depressed may like   depressing  dull  meaningless  lonely  succeeded  its unlikely anyone would enjoy film  maybe n t supposed    
1,gus van zant really ashamed producing film  visually  sure  great looking  however  vision kurt cobain character nothing stumbling mumbling half wit personality reason screen  this movie insult real cobain  nirvana  nirvana fans  avoid this movie at all costs  it garbage absolutely business even mentioned breath nirvana  cobain  music general 
1,last days easily worst movie i seen since eight heads duffle bag  from start finish  disjointed scene entirely long  in fact  i watched last minutes movex speed n t miss thing  van sant establish kind connection characters  you n t really even know blake troubled musician  says synopsis  half way movie  spend time watching mope around house  appears  drug induced stupor  but really n t know s wrong s interesting watch i high hopes movie  especially watching making special features section  complete waste time 
2,tears anger tears anger is i think kurt deserves respect boring movie i hoping near future  one director would thecourage make film based tom grant s investigation watch courtney and kurt instead  dont waste ur money justice kurt  miss love 
1,i never compelled review anything i watched movie last days yesterday evening  the movie absolutely nothing  the character supposed cobain mumbled  walked around  passed entire movie  it awful complete waste time  i seriously angry watching  i stayed watch  how crap ever make 
1,would n t nice _not kurt gone kim gordon  he could ve member family  how cool would kim gordon thurston moore parents  kurt could sat floor surrounded kittens  making drawings sperm embryos crayons this indulgent pile might well nothing  instead ol  gus decided cash kurts  real question   everyone else 
1,whether movie based kurt cobain still boring horrendous film i ever seen  in fact  i could watch nothing happened  sorry gus career gone wirh bang 
1,do n t waste time watching movie  it s time life i never get back  my thought   could thoroughly embarrassed something incredibly useless public consumption  unless re obsessed curt cobain would watch anything remotely  n t bother 
1,because first time watch undoubtly last well  overall i believed i going watching movie loosely based life kurt cobain leading death instead i  graced  blake  kurt  sitting creek  sitting lake  sitting  half time re looking still object characters screen  there plot somewhere mumbling might miss  not mention n t much dialogue begin with i would n t recommend movie nirvana kurt cobain fans this movie bored tears  i barely finished 
1,this movie far worst i ever seen  i fast forward  painfully  you would better constipated  sitting throne comic book instead watching load garbage eastcoast phil tcbrn 
2,first i would like say i love nirvana s music i every cd  i really hated movie  kurt would really disappointed someone even made movie would probably pissed sucked  he extreamly talented musician deserves remembered way better way decided portray  i beleive kill murdered  kim gordon sonic youth  good band  recently stated beleives kurt murdered  the fact though gus van sant made terrible movie  anyone trying force beleiving like movie n t cheat know bad could really enjoy  even big fan kurt van sant bad  if nothing else kurt tried teach us n t try force like horrible movie kurt van sant  i hope helped someone thanks zack
1,ok  i must say i huge fan nirvana kurt s work  film     interesting re willing watch nothing  this film kurt s last days  terrible thing watch fan get absolutely nothing  most music movie terrible choice  part movie liked scene ghost climbs body  this movie n t hold interest  wandering  mumbling  eating  avoiding  how could make film kurt cobain  made grunge  terrible  i must say i n t think fan nirvana watch this also movie says  in memory ofkurt cobain196this movie memory kurt 
2,maybe kurt cobain spent  last days  mean good film  this another stylish psuedo intellectual art house film  gus van sant quickly becoming like stephen sodenberg  a guy trying make cool artsy flicks seem really deep meaning niave watcher   like sodenberg  anyone even bothers tread deep analysis film apt feel cheated tricked  gus van sant even attempts lift whole significance grunge scene movie seems contrived silly  like looking significance everything none  just buy another nirvana album  do n t even bother 
1,brilliant cinematography fails mend meditation last days kurt cobain  it s frustrating experience rewarding  ultimately leaves empty 
2,as others commented  dreary humdrum  last days  feels authentic  sad  typical hollywood rendering  i suppose art sheer guts make portrayal bleak  real  but said  invest minutes s time story  actually protagonists  in case  n t set up  reason  in fact  i found actively disliking  even loathing characters    when came  i n t anymore  if really cobain became like  death n t tragedy  it blessing postscript  would nice see sant make movie identifies real human beings rather drugged characatures last days my own private idaho  those folks    let  we n t need 
2,film  last days  watch wonder  unsure ever make shelf back player  
1,this worst movie i ever seen  i continually watch i falling asleep  boring  uninteresting  bias  completely horrible reason i watched true love kurt cobain  i would even give star i choice

5,this wonderful wealth curriculum parents interested teaching preschoolers  it wonderful christian resources i highly recommend 
2,i love chekhov  review nothing value writing  it s dover thrift edition  two thirds way book  around p  chekhov ends  kubla khan  random poem begins  i n t book i ve forgotten poem   it s bizarre  i m missing three stories fourth  i m sure freak mistake copies n t flaw  particular book n t quite useful i hoped  unless i read  kubla khan   
3,a good instroduction chekhov  put terrible editing amusing failures english  this whole series runs gamut  the old translations well enough give good picture chekhov sbest stories  hopefully whetting appetite 
3,great   short stories  if like sort thing  ll happy   ll bogged incredibly long russian names bored recurring themes poor peasants  harsh life  etc  not great introduction chekhov  read re fan
3,this decent harness money nearly good fully adjustable leather harness  the quality ok not junk certainly premium item either  downsides compared leather harness  walked off hence replacement    designed flat heads  the top loop really short sits high head  feels like wants slide head i tilted forward    the top strap adjust   swivel side straps twists reps scrapes    chain kinda small both links distance  if afford  i suggest getting better leather iron mind strap  otherwise work ok  n t expect much 
2,the i shipped junk  it broke first time i put pounds  one straps hangs past ear tore right  one pictures shows guy two red olympic plates thing  the red plates kilos  s pounds  frankly  i would n t trust hardware thing much weight  it broke way i still use  ll good long i m putting pounds  i m going keep using  however  i i d trade better

3,well built  i wish top strap adjustable  i rigged chin strap full range flexions 
2,product recieved n t look nothing like photo shown  it s full nylon quick link n t even fit chain  it n t even close fitting 
3,this basically genre novel written literary master  faulkner uses experimental technique bad effect give weight story fact undrmines  the race relations angle often expressed charles gavin actually best part book
2,i read read works faulkner  i m innocent student on positive  faulkner create good imagery two scenes graveyard  i like never tries explain  let s reader figure  the symbolism ok re sort thing on negative  he must written drunk editor  publisher adoring public make great allowance  william faulkner   the sentences run on  change subjects midstream simply make sense  the dialogue narrative except quotes surrounding thus since everyone talks  much characterization  the plot simple mystery depends timing  coincidence  stupidity unbelievable if fame author  book would forgotton 
2,why faulkner considered classic writer  who sets standards  intruder dust prime example fail english comp  his run sentences dull  unispiring  two pages long  it s exhausting  if read long sentences  read kerouac  ditch faulkner  
2,as sophomore high school nearly years ago  i terrible experience book  the plot confusing complicated tough vocabulary grammar  in version i borrowed school   long sentence   i m pretty sure  around  pages x size pages  recently  i tried pick  convinced wife  liked reading faulkner  i found slightly easier  real improvement  i believe problem stems something douglas adams said   i m trying literate  literary   i get feeling faulkner trying create literature artform  rather try convey story masses i appreciate many people love story  literary masterpiece  i say i think good 
1,this story difficult stories i read thus far  i supposed summarize story english majors course  sentences long tangled  i keep losing track character talked  i read reread story  still difficulty summarizing story  the excruciatingly long paragraphs makes difficult follow  use caution reading story 
1,i going freshmen high school  this book summer reading list i began read s flow totally lost me in the dust    i stupid  fact i top percentile kids grade across u s after write characters list traits believe i grasp chunks novel  o well yeah  n t even try book 
1,i ve read faulkner  required  voluntarily  still yet figure fuss  yes weave story  good grief  imagine ego thinks turn story incomprehensible  right i m reading bio jay parini trying decipher faulkner code i ll let know i  i guess i ve read much flannery o conner  brilliant  consider faulkner bit precious  slam must   a light august  good  i m reading short stories wonderful  please  present future authors  try engage reader  send him her away frustrated 
1,i eleventh grade advanced placement  ap  english first book i ever read made learn another language  this writer respect readers continously confusing run on sentences distracting word placement  furthermore  respect  laws  language  put keep disgrace novel ever happening  i never read another william faulkner novel  made feel like intelligence stripped  in plain  american  understandable english  this book stinks 
1,i finshed reading sophomore honors class  i sure i never voluntarily read faulkner ever  throughout novel  use punctaution  apostrophe  sentences run long whole page  the first hundred pages require attention a tale two cities  narration gets worse  it s faulkner n t appeal reach person  and make matters worse  book notes anywhere  save essays  help understand  and n t read voluntarily    good luck hope made sparknotes intruder dust 
1,i am currently reading this book as a mandatory outside reading book for myth grade english class  i am on chapter three and i still have no idea of what is going on exactly  faulkner s use of wording is extremely confusing and does not capture the reader at all along with reading the book we have to complete a project explaining the plot and main themes  how can i do this if i do n t understand the book itself  this book is said to be a great peice of american literature but i disagree completely i think it s really bad 
2,thanks stream of conscious narrative  book leans toward incomprehensible side faulkner s canon  despite simple plot often feels would suited short story dragged fit necessary length full length book  when add blatant preachiness  aside inciting event  predictable storyline  book ends work worth 
2,this novel n t rank faulkner s classic work dozens reviews tell  basic problem difficulty writing mystery  plot driven story  prose often gibberish 
4,panned critics written strictly make money  i still find story compelling faulkner s treatment excellent 
2,i bought reviewth round taking boards  on areas i well versed  i found number errors  i verified sources  this makes worry accuracy topics i need help  i found similar problems online questions after  i bought new edition swanson s reviewswanson s family medicine reviewwhich thankfully seem suffer problems 
3,there many mistakes new edition  several questions pre test even correct answer option  there email given questions concerns  functioning email address  least point  i thought maybe way get corrections way make contact  if corrections become available  book valuable  also  website offered exist  least yet  claims january    there many errors  well written easy fun read  great coverage topics boards but makes nervous i might pick mistakes  learn wrong things 
2,the back cover states  thoroughly updated s fourth edition   not true  the differencerd edition three clinical problem sets backrd edition  pages  replaced set additional questions called maintenance certification primer  pages   in first pages may questions changed  editions i n t found yet  even chapter   pictorial atlas  unchanged  and i suspect true  online practice exams  bottom line  buyrd edition used   save   still  book ok fp boards swanson s 
4,i thought book great review test saw much material test  however  test bank week exam i wanted questions  that disappointing  i test questions aafp website helpful provided cme credit well addendum  i got scores today  i rocked boards  i endedth percentile  i attended course  i felt book really put top  it great esoterica boards  my beef i could gain access online questions  mine cd  log onto website number provided front book  the week exam website completely  i ended needing  stress right boards  good luck buy book   
4,i tried board review courses  cd roms board review books past  this hits important subjects ll find actual exam format similar exam  i would recommend plan using future exam recertifications 
3,this good starting point board reviews  it reminds topics brush  for price  lot cheaper spending money time review courses  however  material way date  references answers date backs  medicine changes rapidly acceptable  i studied laptop side i could look current recommendations certain conditions medication usage  etc  but i work could easily looked information i access time spit new edition  
1,this book quite long  lackluster coverage major  features  several errors  i found trying use reference guide becuase size  digging around useful information almost always futile  other books series seem tighter coherent overlong book 
1,this book worst tutorial illustrator book  it n t explain  not good book new illustrator like i 
4,this great cd  repin great player  justice compositions  the lalo wonderfull  although last movement totaly clean  style great great listen  the chausson enough tension  overdone reverbration obvious  the ravel strong  n t beat heifetz version 
5,there tendency write musicians bond fluff provocative way dress like young people girls aware sexuality i hear music professionals music seriously i often listen dvd work i n t watch concert i run program background i something else screen i enjoy performance much a definite recommend 
4,overall  i find dvd quite enjoyable  duel     dallas     bond theme    alexander great    victory  simply blew away  however  time  compositions n t quite work  over orchestrated  it overall interesting though  four violinists talented 
5,i heard bond nephew i fall love group  they bond heart fascination violin music  this new concept violin performance  i recommend dvd  enjoy music see passion performance girls  i buy new violin  my children see play violin  dance sing  i going buy bond presentation  it good choice vivian
5,ever since i started playing violin  people raving orchestra band called bond  i borrowed friend paulina s dvd royal albert hall concert i loved every minute  i recommend people love violin would enjoy watching girls play electric orchestra instruments 
2,good celtic woman hanley westenra   i would say half good  i say great talent  artistically   wrong managed  stopped watching 
4,what s love  four beautiful women playing beautiful music  my criticism s way short  i d imagine ll coming new dvd soon  i d definitely buy 
5,good quality music great show  lively modern mix classical rock music  if like electrified classical music like 
5,the music goes melodramatic exciting  the performance interesting  the four lady musicians attractive  the dvd beautiful picture  what else ask  the bad thing time sound instruments  ladies drowned background music still  make classical music sound exciting  contemporary 
4,although i n t place finger  i feel lacked something give five star rating  the concert entertaining  the ladies extremely sexy talented  if like style music group  i would still recommend 
2,the time i attempted watch concert immediately watching  miracle  girls band  concerts dvd odd reason   i able pieces eject dvd  while  miracle  showed girls band class act exhibiting skillful musicianship  elegance femininity  bond came across like goofy teenage girls lacking class  elegance femininity  ok  skillful musicians  good enough 
1,listen  the   understand one star rating  the overture  admittedly  little cheesy  nothing deserves treatment bond give it classical instruments need dance beat electrification cool  listen anything band apocalyptica  even godspeed you  black emperor  use celli   music pushes boundaries traditional classical music  well  without resorting electronic beats scantily clad women if must order  order apocalyptica s  cult   purposes comparison 
3,this dvd live concert  at least   although  gifted string performers actually playing music front live audience royal albert hall  music track superimposed top live performance  makes concert feel sound like music video  there song played  live  experience alone  i still rated dvd  stars  it enjoyable entertaining watch bond anyhow  just understand full live concert experience paying 
1,i purchased bosch tka two months ago s nothing trouble  to begin  feels cheap  plastic moving parts feel like re fall moment  often  but worse  unless careful unit  coffee kitchen counter carafe coffee brewed  it s fun clean mess  i called bosch customer service treated rudely  complaining i referred outside service agent quite pleasant deal far  they ve offered pay ship unit re sending completely new unit  hopefully new function better  although i m holding breath given poor design overall

3,i enjoyed anne perry s books many years  slaves left rather cold  the journey several characters make america beginning civil war seems unreal  perhaps i southerner whose great grandfathers fought sides great divide  i think  though  lack shame consequences yr old girl s running away much older  even crossing ocean becoming involved soldiers  greater cause dissatisfaction  where s outraged mother  where conversations concerning ruination lack future prospects due sullied reputation  why union officer even think sending back home  the book seems hurried perry sounds depth 
3,quite keeping series  good character development a good read  usual anne perry  one actually feel quality life attitudes prevalent

2,not stronger entries series  slaves of obsession suffers many set pieces enough emotional complexity usually found series  far much time spent philosophical battle union confederate issues  battles better detailed many works  enough developing strong narrative  the trip america monk hester recapture american runaway english teen charge murder relatively ridiculous serves opportunity perry showcase hester s nursing ability  it s interesting scene  really fills pages move narrative forward  even mystery s solution resolution left less satisfied  perfunctory ending pedestrian entry series

1,the dvd unwatchable sound intermittent positively worst purchase i ever made amazoni suspect dvd pirate copy
1,i read reviews elsewhere sounded positive  honestly film awful  my friend i seriously discussed leaving first minutes  somthing i never done   decided stick hope would get better  it  marginally  i ended wishing i walked first place wasted time   stupid lines pointless  plot   it insulting hawaiians trans gender people not funny  truly  i like drew barrymore  adam sandler playing character brain head  chemistry actors      rent the wedding singer instead  do n t waste your time and money  age film immature  and age bored 
2,i expecting lot movie i got it s basically girl lost short term memory auto moblie accident guy tries get fall love  yadda  yadda  yadda   there lot jokes fell flat backs  movie  awhile really begins annoy you the acting nothing great diolouge flat out horrible sandler n t give good performance barrymore okay basically  s repeatitive movie delivers lame jokes thing every ten minutes if re looking good movie  look elsewhere this lame  unfunny  boring stupid movie  save money something worthwhile 
1,once funny stuff previews  this could funny movie  n t  do n t bother 
1,can adam get much worse  this naturally bad stupid movie  adam sandler needs give  funny anymore  all play type character movies  do n t buy film  anymore adam sandler movies 
3,not bad movie  nearly funny  pretty much funniest parts commercials  suprisingly  and parts funny  carbon copy s funny scenes sandler movies  it s fun recognize line movies  s entire scenes   gets old fast  it gets old seeing people stupid movies  it s cool see cameo  s always loosers  if i could avoided seeing  i would  kind disapointment  dan aykroyd minor role  the thing good mentions kallahan auto parts  movie tommy boy  company trying forcefully takeover tommy kallahan i miss happy gillmore  
4,adam sandler plays guy giveup love meets drew barrymore whohas short term memory loss  forgetseverything next day  rememberanything happened tragicmoment life messed brain 
3,i quite disappointed  stealing idea  memento  humour  i thought great funny  at  i found plot flat  the cool though well  movie done make girlfriend cry  sandler still plays kind characters usual maybe softer lines  drew barrimore course hot hot hot well  something simply  is weak script  direction edition fantastic either  to conclude i say s still good entertainment bad movie it s sure not best sandler movie certainly greatest comedy 
3,this movie combines themes  groundhog day    memento  make romantic comedy woman never remembers prior day  falls love anyway  adam sandler drew barrymore terrific jobs leads  supporting cast excellent  the problem movie  s big  adam sandler s motivation continuing pursue ms barrymore discovering ailment  underlying sickly feeling continuously taking advantage brain damaged woman  even though movie well done every level escape fact  ultimately seriously undermines romance comedy 
5,just watching previews  i knew good movie  little i know i wrong  this best movie watch boyfriend girlfriend  it s classic adam sandler comedy along drew barrymore charm 
4,adam sandler  typically vulgar  careless person  expressed totally different side acting abilities film  instead playing entirely comedic role  sandler loving  caring developed relationship beautiful woman  drew barrymore  barrymore well  playing part gorgeous young lady plagued occurrence car accident  beautiful job portraying character  she falls love sandler  car wreck causes relive single day life  causing forget meeting sandler  once sandler figures handicap  desperately tries conjure way help remember relationship preserve love feel  i highly recommend movie  it worth seeing multiple times cdawg
5,i saw previews tv movie finally talked husband renting   he usually pick movies usually kick em up types blow em up ones   my husband rented  movies night   token  chick flick     he put watching first night  second night watched movie way long  we moved movie came away absolutely  love   my husband even admit  movie    us movie   this movie really fun watch takes journey involves many emotions  look good film 
5,adam s drew b make bangup team movie  drew beautiful quite innocent soul  it satisfying  yet surprising ending  a good twist it s refreshing watch comedy characters have character  makes uplifting viewing drew b s character wakes every morning thinking s father s birthday    day auto accident injured memory adam sandler falls figures way live happily ever after heartwarming hilarious 
4,every time i watch movie  makes feel good   it proves love find way  although sometimes takes genius figure way  i loved romantic parts movie  especially idea first kiss  drew barrymore got experience short term memory problem it could better without crude humor relationship adam sandler s character drew barrymore s charactor reason enough watch movie the ending never fails give chills it s heartwarming terrific 
4,yes adam always play role every movie i knew going  overall i found movie cute sweet  i thought drew berrymore s character great  wonderful job i thought comedic timing great i thought doug  lucy s brother  played sean astin  funny  i thought sean astin extremely funny role rob schiender funny  always playing weird bizarre your character scares roles got bit annoying  overall though i thought movie really good perfect movie see date 
5,this best movie i seen long time  i dont know made watch times already  i far sick  i seen  times theatres i waited  months day released buy  n t yet seen  watch  better yet buy  wont dissapointed  i promise matter many times watch  still great first time     
2,after  the wedding singer   sandler barrymore reunite screen deliver somewhat promising ultimately average romantic comedy  remember guy pearce s character  memento   well   first dates  drew barrymore plays lucy  girl loses recent memory morning  virtually living routine endlessly  adam sandler s character falls love dares conquer attention everyday  cute  touching  anyway  movie ends repetitive  slow  empty especially unfunny  mixing drama comedy yet failing suceed  the directing nothing special either  performances characters flat  fortunately  flick still presents entertainment value  it s complete disaster  but much better movies around  bernardo bertolucci s  the dreamers  michel gondry s  eternal sunshine spotless mind     watchable equally forgettable 
1,there much raunch movie trying pass humor and give break  sandler  town  banging tourists evry chance gets  yuk  oh wait  he gets totally reformed overnight becomes selfless  committed  sacrificial willing wait forever enjoy lifelong relationship woman forgets every day  sure  maybe would virgin looking true love would beliveable and boob  ass  homo  vomit  sex jokes plain mindless talentless   sure still love years lets go sex nauseating  how would like said say wedding vows  preacher  looking fat wife  it s funny  it s tasteless tacky the good thing movie 
1,i enjoyed the wedding singer  i honestly  i thought sandler barrymore good chemistry  script entertaining  good jokes   refrained corny  slow boring  now lets first dates  lets good chemistry  happened  god knows    entertaining script  boo  bum vomit gags go far   good jokes  this film  ok  s bad  lets say  mr deeds little nicky  massive disapointment  it came across like last minute idea sandler buddies vacationing hawaii though  ah hell  lets version groundhog day pass movie  do favour  you watch a nice romantic comedy    rent when harry met sally  wit crass wins everytime 
3,i watched movie twice  i got laughs  adam sandler nothing like jim carrey  funny  good job serenading lucy  drew barrymore  movie  another unfunny moment movie gay guy wanting make love henry roth  homosexuality funny  found every day sundayth cop gave ticket  soundtrack  really sounded stupid  mostly bob marley no doubt  i said  no doubt sucks  adam sandler listening crap  going hard time getting laid 
2,this worst adam sandler movies  this rental worth buying 
3,this comedy starring adam sandler drew barrymore  always annoying rob schneider   drew plays woman loses memory morning wakes  adam gets try day make fall love   the acting pretty good  movie s funny moments  really stupid  cute  comedy 
3,i really love movie n t stop watching again however  i little disappointed quality blu ray version  felt like s dvd quality 
4,to much love  try get loved fall love every single day   i say  it s told sandler s performance  
5,adam sandler drew barrymore give memorable performances funny romantic comedy  do n t worry guys n t total chick flick kinda  this movie shot beautiful state hawaii  of course sandman makes movie worth buying 
3,this review going say anything n t said adam sandler movies  i believe fitting  seeing sandler n t given us anything new since billy madison  do n t get wrong  movie funny moments  coupled really  really cute love story lead ridiculous conflict  eventually resolved upon sandler ends woman dreams  of course  sums every sandler movie  i think  memento  twist story kind interesting  so  i n t say bad movie  s  could get story sandler s movies  i realize review pointless  i m bored feel like criticizing something   viva internet 
3,bought gift  the person bought enjoys sara evans music  they requested cd i bought 
4,sad regular dvd special features blu ray version  loved watching music videos regular dvd  blah good
5,husband i went see movie  great laughs  love adam sandler drew barrymore wedding singer loved much movie 
3,imagine bobby goldsboro song honey   know  a tearjerker loving young couple  puppy woman   well imagine instead lyrics went something like he flirt changed ways  lovely changed  she special girl  could n t remember anything   heck  she car accident  sad  say  her father paints garage white everyday th october paper  time  she always thinks s sunday  husband stranger  every morning   well  s first dates yet  screen  s quite nice story  side characters act fool quite entertaining  s memorable  heartfelt goofy poster lets  about six ten 
1,i thought would fun bring along movies set hawaii family trip  what disappointment missed half movie bc item sent substandard 
3,characters like second tom make laugh  cry  listen  they add light film make speed like big tornado whirling away hawai movie takes place  it starts like regular romantic comedy turnes something wonderful  adam sandlers movie keeps dating n t fingd right person goes cafe  there sees pretty  cheerful drew barrymore  he falls love instantley  but finds memory problem n t remember next day  and goes series efforts make remember  the movies really predictebel i m getting bit tired kind movies  adam sandler talented plays much person  it s like movies long movie  but i n t resist watching first dates  but resist 
4,i n t say much reviewers n t already said  this movie freaking hilarious scenes  favorite adam sadnler s character diner fake crying acting n t know read  wailing moaning sobbing catch attention girl wants 
4,i usually despise adam sandler  i find brand humor cheesy distasteful  however  i must confess movie captured  drew barrymore extremely charming  probably along ever after  the soundtrack  uses mostly songss covered current artists conveys perfectly nature movie  rob schneider  another person i n t stand actually extremely funny  and sandler great  measurate endearing  even scatological jokes work  this great  enjoyable date movie  fall love  if  stars couple sandler s routines irritated little bit movie surprisingly good  rent buy 
4,the first semi serious movie seen played adam sandler co stars drew barrymore watching movie found better expected movie outragesly funny bad rather sad side added story enough make cry  the movie humour adams previuos movies funny none less the movie starts adams character going girls dumping soon afternoon finds visiting calm ocean side restaurant meets lucy  drew barrymore  day day would fall love think appropriate method live life best possibly can  combination witty desgusting characters makes movie enjoyable watch original humour previous adam sandler movies enjoyable would highly recommend watching movie 
4,i n t bore plot movie i assume idea s ve far  i found film stood quite well romantic comedy  it delightfully funny bit sad times  like life   i surprised reviewers taken film seriously disturbed critical events portrayed  it s film s meant entertain  it great job  terrific on screen chemistry sandler  although i n t stand films  barrymore 
3,fast foward firstmin movie actually becomes watchable  ever gets good  that advice  heed ll well 
2,i made mistake going movie the wedding singer mind  i loved movie  begin live  what shame waste time  appealed year old mainly inane liners oftenraw comments  what size walrus  member anything movie attempt add filler otherwise dull overplayed plot 
3,maybe writers film amnesia ms barrymore s character  they forgot put comedy film  the film moments  way warrant rental  it none hysterical sandler ve enjoy 
2,i n t know  movie disturbed  perhaps concept film  or imagining happening happening drew barrymore s character  whatever  kept enjoying movie  i really find sweet cute funny way  it odd  i know people experience awful form memory loss   makes good dramatic film  not romantic comedy  i mean  i understand people would wish make light situation make romantic whatnot   n t work  and parts supposed funny  really n t  it kind desperate actually 
3,adam sandler s movies oh goofy  his idea humor annoyhing times  however  intermixed childish behavior true love oh beautiful  and sandler show vulnerable side fortunately movie relatively short long depth  nonetheless  characters kind amusing  if mood something overly ellaborate light hearted  flick fit bill

5,vanessa definitely changed shows incredible cd  i havent taken cd player yet  it quite different first  similar time  the songs deeper darker  apparent later disc  the content real  nothing fake pretentious  this calm cd moody well i saw vanessa concert joe s pub   getta chance i recommend going check out  shes unbelievable if like vanessa s whole debut miles  i think ll love cd well  you expect material always true industry garbage  if truly appreciate piano real vocals true talent  listen  
3,vanessa carlton fav performers  i enjoyst song white houses  rest album quite dark sound last however  fan  i recommend add collection 
4,what commercial  do n t silly  great work talented artist still needs grow bit 
3,somehow i managed find used copy actual release date  prompting curses indie store clerk  cd wanting     n t ask made happy the album fun  most songs enjoyable pop way  the lyrics feel shallow  feel innocent   even re innocent subjects  and thankfully music usually manages match innocent tone  it s definately meant serious album   harmonium  probably fling cd   sort enjoyable certain season life moved pulled nostaligic purposes  it n t  however  endearing classic 
4,  harmonium  obviously great album it shows difference debut album  be not nobody   music ranges private radio   poppy  hilary duff like sound dancing moonlight sort fling   who s to say  offers deeper message  falling love young age the best songs album without doubt  c est lae vie     this is life      the wreckage     papa   whether like avril lavigne maroon  album 
4,i waiting cd quite time  worth wait  i think first single  white houses  awesome song  video fun  she talented  growth artist shown cd last  in opinion  still room growth though  continues develop artist  very much worth buying listening overall 
2,sounds like ashlee simpson nice pianos  maybe went ballet school
1,carlton thinks damn profound  oooooo came self important pseudo intellectual album names ever  be not nobody  be not nobody  try  be educated   this girl shallow child  shows daft music  just drop like steinbeck song n t make smart  worldly  here s cookie  shut go play even narcissistic pseudo intellectual boyfriend johnny third eye blind  these two cut lame ass hipster mold find coffee shop berkeley  pontificating genius never realizing special matter people tell  you real  intelligent  music  try john lennon tori amos  listening carlton s lyrical drivel like grading freshmen philosophy paper  s trite irrelevant 
1,one worst vocalists today  i n t think irritating  singer  ms carlton  thankfully latest cd bombed hopefully i n t subjected pre school like vocals 
5,will always nessaholic forever  love album first album there seems extra track european version album  its called  streets   favourite tracks white houses  whos say  afterglow  san francisco  private radio streets

1,she s featured time warner cable commercials west tennessee  her voice actually quite irritating fact promoting cd manner huge turn off

1,right  admit  n t get  never heard irritating commercial started airing times day  keep remote handy n t hear bland  uninspired  amateurish rendition great stones song  cd fluff  s emotion   dad studio

1,you must joking  clay aiken looks like fairy  dresses like fairy  talks like fairy  he looks like made clay  ha  ha  voice right awful  cd mess  he definitely product poor american tv given oppurtunity put another wretched album  blah 
2,let start saying i formally educated music  unfortunately  i exact criticism clay many  including simon   he s got huge voice  lacks emotion  he hit high notes  voice richness  obvious clay knows nothing sings  song stylists able show voices make audience feel time  that s sort thing separates wayne newton s bruce springsteen s   or kelly clarkson s sheryl crowe s  mr aiken n t  screaming notes singing  s plain screaming  and s reason voted number two number american idol  it s enough hit notes  make feel   i feel song saying  otherwise  seeing hearing perform worth price charged 
3,i began watching american idol coworker raved clay  i continued watch voice beautiful heartbreaking  i waited cd thank heaven i listened clips first internet i knew buy it his glorious voice changed bland  ordinary  sounds like every pop star voice songs average  i afraid rca would him on show  clay kind voice music secondary  meaning n t sang  wanted hear voice  on cd songs matter since voice average n t like songs reason buy listen song clips buying 
2,just reminder clay  succeed business respected singer performer suggest work w best composers musical arrangers business i someone like david foster mind  dianne warren even jim brickman i n t see talent go waste think boy  deserve best work w best business

1,i m sorry every claymate clay aiken n t really type  he s annoying  whiny  meaningful  it seems like hes marketingth graders mom  invisible not meaningful love song  pure pop  if listen meaningful male vocals  i would suggest coldplay  keane  alexi murdoch i think clay aiken good voice broadway theater  produces top pop album  s wasting talent 
1,while clay great voice album total bore  every song sounds exactly i glad i listened album n t waste money  there two good songs album i already puke hearing 
4,dear amazonians  i think clay aiken strong addition popular music scene  the combination youthful good looks agile voice make great pop musician on technical note though  reason four star rating  song  when you say you love me   hear clay clear voice two minute forty three second mark   cd player   this minor technicality though i sure clay overcome future releases  all in all  i think clay aiken talented artist improve time go clay  take   daniel

5,i concerned clay s ability enter pop world  given songs fell love ai  my concerns eliminated second i pushed play  amazing album  captures many talents  without overdoing  i instantly captivated lyrics  melodies  absolutely love song no    highly recommend add family s collections 
2,it obvious clay aiken talent fooling  he definitely talented pop stars right  however  people producing album poor job showcasing talent clay aiken holds  every song album sounds  the emotions portrayed clay diverse  every emotion fits either category  i singing pain    we going get pain   the truth album painful enough actually listen  the song less than quality debut worth listening title track   measure of a man   this song realm  actually worthwhile message in summation  talent  album  maybe next time  clay 
3,c mon clay  know better cd  i calendar marked big release date  could n t wait hear vocals i d sincerely impressed american idol competition  the vocals  songs wimpy  i ve thought thought word description  s close i get  wimpy  songs sound alike  seem whining someone left behind there cuts display clay s amazing talent  whole  seems particular thought went choices material  hopefully  clay bigger star pick choose record  selections better  some best performances shed shy boy personna  made us rock roll   remember red leather jacket     would i buy  yes  i still impressed talent  would i buy second cd contained samekind bland selections  no  sorry  
3,after read reviews site  i wishing i could respond cd kind enthusiasm others  unfortunately  determined i love cd  i sadly disappointed  someone made decision going turn clay something s  pop star  instead letting  amazing voice  if hear clay s talent showcased  buy  bridge over troubled water  single  if re looking album artist beautiful voice producer really knows s  i would highly recommend josh groban

3,the guy sing however material picked could better  sounds like s group chicago sound reason  no real strong love songs  bridge troubled water isnt neither on the wings of love  those songs i think would made cd somewhat better  i dont dislike  may grow thou 
3,if think voice heard show re wrong  somebody turned beautiful voice bland  ordinary sounds like pop singer  on top songs bland ordinary voice sound  on american idol show clay kind voice music secondary  meaning n t singing wanted hear voice  on cd need like songs reason buy it i gave  stars since average rating strictly average cd  if clay sung way sang show would n t enough stars sky rate it get ai christmas cd  sings  first noel  show voice  beautiful

5,i love album  in order  favorites  touch  measure a man  no more sad songs  i will survive you invisible  in opinion  showcase voice best 
2,i like clay  but i thrill cd  rueben seem impressive
4,clay the voice awesome gift  the studio production sound  clay s voice comes despite over production cd  this over production sound  say  music    make many cds  i would love hear sing simplistic background music  letting voice carry songs  pure clay  i wonder type cd neil sedaka would  still might   produce clay  yes  i looking forward complete clay rendition  solitaire   all  great cd  especially first  i admire morality greatly appreciate cd i listen anyone w o concern lyrics  thanks  clay    i look forward next cd   next   next    
5,wow this cd is amazing  i would buy of them because they re so good  i love clay aiken  this cd blew me away  wow  what a voice 
5,this cd definitely secures clay place music industry  he strong vocals  would make think s music business much longer american idol tv  clay singer future  keep watching  already good  likely get better 
4,i ll admit clay aiken sing  there s doubt  but question everyone s mind  simon cowell s second season american idol  the search superstar  aiken really voice pop music  i agree cowell  his voice tends broadway musicals actual top chart topping  his debut solid  though  i think ve second season  distinct voice  measure of a man measures   
2,i really wanted enjoy cd  many times i listened     i cant  yes  clay good voice  i hear emotion  maybe better choice songs voice would help  i feel  time  mature rounded performer 
1,i n t much clay ai  ruben  matter   i got cd anyway since really good voice  well  couple good songs cd   invisible   although lyrics weird   i invisible i could watch room      no more sad songs   chorus  i survived   overall  though  i n t really cd  if fan show  ll definitely like album 
2,invisible song cd good  wife loves clay  i always tell won t around long neither american idol as far easy listening goes pleasing enough don t look rock roll 
1,god  actually gets zero stars    anyone listen schlock     clay aiken sounds exactly like backstreet crossed whitney houston  cd full sorry sounding pop hooks soppy balladry absolutely aweful  good pop hooks ballads  get simon garfunkle instead  feel like soppy balladry get david bowie s  hunky dory    make sure pass true piece crap album   seriously  sucks really really bad
1,without studio trickery  would community college musicals  the make over n t either  i would n t spend money i d give away given  what new lows america s talent standards slip 
2,do n t belive hype   good tracks  single bridge over troubled water  he talented cd baaad  what happened  i loved show  song choices lame say least  maybe next better  better burn buy 
2,i disappointed first cd clay  there still nothing wrong voice  i admired beginning appearance american idol  but songs effort rather ordinary  downright boring  i would enjoyed covers older modern standards  effort made  bridge over troubled waters   he deserves better management   his voice talent deserves far better team behind  i hope future outings material capabilities 
1,who buys listens stuff   i got cd gift must say i disappointed hear america likes  his voice sounds average  broadway musical  outstanding  my bet thank american idol sells albums 
2,having watched clay really get deep singing american idol  i expected much delivers cd  the arrangements weak  singing shallow  songs sound  for person depth range songs  poor compilation  i vastly disappointed 
3,i enjoyed rubens clays tv performances equally  they something different offer  unfortunatelly clay got stuck greatest composers album  yes catchy fun tunes  something clay deserves  he needs songs average pop radio hits  clay voice better quality songs  although i enjoy listening album i say rushed intended clay perform  on hand rubens cd prety close perfection i time post review would say    stars  i hope next album clay get lucky get right composer songs 
1,clay aiken worst singers ever american idol  the songs debut cd predictible sleep inducing  even william hung capable making better cd drab garbage  with boring singles like  invisible    the way   i n t understand americans could make guy star  please  clay  insist making music  least decency nice gay anthem like  i will survive    ymca   
4,after waiting patiently clay s premier cd i fairly please results although i fond recording sound  i think better job could done bring fabulous voice  plus  could mixed bit  all basic theme out tracks  i liked  songs  not crazy i survived you  perfect day touch  my favorite ones invisable  i carry you no more sad songs besides this night i really think sings better live  s talent  i think cd pretty good  i hoping would included solitaire  hopefully  furture cd  all  i would recomend 
4,love singing hate singing  way top stopping

2,i feel clay s incredible range  far better  this cd unimaginative bland  i m returning unopened  sorry  clay  better luck next time 
3,clay aiken incredible voice  performance mesmerizing  but clay s voice overwhelmed backup singers instrumentation  voice certainly star production  secondary feature also  songs cd sound like pop music  i d like hear mature choices next cd  josh groban  
3,i n t big fan clay ai friend played album i bought next day  clay s voice n t sound wierd broadway recorded i really enjoy songs  invisible best song album closely followed measure sad songs  the album get bit samey listen whole thing overall good album hopefully ll get bit variety next album 
3,after listening cd  i little disappointed  i think songs flat n t allow clay optimize tremendous voice range  i think probably rushed  i wish  bridge over troubled waters  included well 
2,obviously people voted clay aiken based incredible covers good songs competition  teenager would n t familiar alot songs re often classic oldies  but reason decided make put cd full kind songs teenagers probably go nothing like sung win votes gain oppurtunity make cd first place  so i lost i n t understand  i hope next cd wider musical range 
1,i huge clay fanatic throughout ai hype  i fell love voice personality dashing good looks  however  cd disappointed  the voice i fell love  live  voice  i n t like  studio  voice much  i like   songs cd  makes sad give bad review  i looking forward cd since may 
4,i ve looking forward hearing album months  i love  clay sounds wonderful  shine  perfect day  measure man probably well written well developed far production writing album  lighter  pop material like run me touch incredibly sensual full yearning  i could hear run me movie soundtrack  there specific production moments lame that seem riffing  try fit s n t quite work  happens invisible touch  overall  i really  really love album i think harder rock  alternative music listeners would  several songs appeal alternative audience people get past fact clay n t write  sure sing hell  i m thrilled rca found balance american idol clay recording artist clay  love it 
4,o k  maybe i getting old  i always rock roll girl  give stones zeppelin manilow diamond day  way   but kid rocks   i reuben fan first american idol glance  clay song selection  poise incredible voice  this album would better stronger producing team  hey  good first effort  rock  clay  
4,five stars clay  three rca clay s debut album problem single   s overproduced  overpackaged  he sounds boy band pop star ish  nasal y head voice full throated chesty like sounds demos  on hand  song choices good go well together  there integrity album  i think right proud  overall  though  i think s live in person performer studio performer  he gets energy audiences  singing gift them hopefully clay find way integrate love music teaching  the next mr rogers  i d gladly enroll school clay 
5,clay aiken amazing god given gift  all songs well done decent songs  they nice lyrics way would offend anyone  as mother small children  i would recommend everyone  clay s phenomenal voice i could listen every day  ever since getting cd last thursday  he amazing range diversity  do favor buy

4,clay s awesome  s gon get better  next album prove m sure  hopefully show little voice  maybe throw acappela songs  would great  anyway like clay ll like  even n t like yet might listening
2,the enduring criticism  commercial pop  music time producers get done electronica multiple tracking  singer gets lost shuffle  such case  the clay aiken dazzling talent soaring high notes loved american idol buried  production  album becomes another many literally  anybody  could sung  i guess ll wait s proven sell enough  commercial mainstream    risk    broadway  album  sing hard to sing oldies became famous ai love clay  album 
4,some reviewer posted people saying negative things critiquing album due cnn s comments  clay perfect record company great album i find going back orginal a i tapes i hear sing songs like  everlasting love    botw  hear amazing range  thats 
5,i love cd could n t wait  i loved clay s voice first ai tryout  it seems anything sings becomes beautiful song  i listened first cd much family ready kick  they glad i playing new  this cd great songs age listen  i wish would stop putting many back singers  loud music back  we hear clay  we n t anything loud n t hear beautiful voice s  he stong voice  n t need stuff many singers use  make sound good  he class i love forever 
1,for compare ruben clay  comparison  ruben b c true talent  while clay  made   ruben still ruben  i listened clay s first  songs turn  while sing peoples songs well hold tune album  i extremely disappointed  would buy cd 
1,give break  i see fuss  i listened cd although clay sings well  songs boring ballads sound  i agree negative reviews media  this album nothing get excited i sure would n t waste money  you ll get money josh groban s new cd 
1,clay aiken stinks  he manufactured pop star  whose facial expressions american idol made look constipated  these songs cliched over sung  let s hope ruben s effort better sentimental rubbish
1,okay  clay aiken may dork person  fact matter runner american idol sing  s it when i saw american idol  i disgusted  clay sings cheesy awful ballads make hit  mute  button remote  what s even disgusting god awful wardrobe  the fact many teenage girls love clay makes vomit    this music nerds  get real    
5,i rooted clay throughout american idol  knew cd would amazing  i listened cd disappointed bit  his voice beautiful  songs well written  great job clay  thankyou sharing incredible talents world 
4,first let say i listen types music   i really liked clay american idol i decided give new cd try   it really seems like studio guys changed clay s voice little bit cd   he definitely sounded better tv   it s kinda weird   all songs perfectly written great meaning music top notch still seems like voice mesh blend music   does anyone else get feeling   anyway   i guess diehard clay fan pick   if   defintely listen buy   
5,this cd really reflects artist  every track excellent  if clay fan  i highly recommend cd  if n t yet fan  hearing 
5,love clay  love incredible voice  love cd  each time i listen  i new favorite  some songs inspire  make dance  make feel good  as fan old standards  easy listening  etc  future album covers would nice  in fact  i believe i would happy hear clay sing every song ever written

5,i love this cd  a very refreshing and unique sound from the newest superstar in the music industry 
3,ok  i rock fan fan pop  i think first cd clay songs utilize obviously gifted voice great effect  songs audience surely identify  there traces beatles  fleetwood mac  elton john songs  my complaint drum mix could little stronger songs maybe give little  pop   that said  opening song  invisible  perfect pop  means i n t get head  with clay going life rush make cd  i think fine effort   stars good rating  
4,i love clay  loved ai  i think loads talent  i bought cd day came  initially i liked thought songs sounded  then i listened       s car  work  home  i love cd  clay fine job songs  although i hoping stronger songs  vocally  cd great example clay s style personality  i looking forward buying ruben studdard s cd comparing cd i enjoy best  oh  i read liner notes clay s cd saw danielle broisebois sings background vocals couple clay s songs  terrific encouraged buy danielle s older cd  arrive all over you  i m enjoying vocals well 
5,i buy two copies cd  car work i n t stop listening  clay s voice wonderful never faulters  i n t stopped listening since initially released  i n t wait second 
1,why world record mess  he better american idol material crap  ugh save money

2,this album terrible  he took chances  forget hype album  i wish old napster business save buying album  i liked american idol album media push promote real winner reuben terrible  go reuben  no clay
1,not good album  many songs put sleep half time  right boring  in opinion  darren hayes much interesting compared clay  if good cd get something else  isnt worth time money 
1,while clay aiken amazing talent singing  s album better suites middle aged america instead younger   poppy  audience  i get irritated seeing people compare ruben clay  they two totally different genres 
2,i disappointed album hearing clay s beautiful voice american idol  it s like producers trying force clay pop mold  i kept listening waiting clay really let loose belt song  did n t happen  maybe next album clay clay 
4,clay aiken makes stunning debut first album measure man   this cd sold copies first week release usa  s easy see  clay s vocals heard believed  his version neil sedaka classic solitaire  amazing  makes song  other stand outs the way   invisible   run me   perfect day  title track measure man   you n t go wrong album 
1, i love clay   rocked ai my problem song  invisible   lyrics  if i invisible  would watch room   stalkers of the world unite    does anyone else find song deeply disturbing i  he s got great voice tho  he needs think songs s singing recording   i mean seriously  
5,perfection  the whole family loves cd  you dont need skip button cd 
5,i think clay s cd absolutely great  i listen every day  i would like make point clay bashers ruben studdards  fans  you better watch out  if intentionally trying bash clays  cd lower ratings  prepare ruben s cd comes  clay s fans far number rubens  fans push comes shove    what s saying what goes around  comes around   grow  toys go home  oh way clay s cd great despite rude comments 
2,during run  american idol   i like  riveted show week week clay aiken s astonishing voice  on show  sang excelled variety musical genres  however   measure man   producers done clay disservice giving mediocre ballads sing  i kept hoping least uptempo song  funky song  even funny song  display clay s amazing range playful personality  i guess i ll wait concert dvd get full fledged dose clay rival ai performances  cd n t deliver 
3,i huge clay fan  first cd purchase  years  i extremely disappointed cd really show fantastic voice  clay s voice meant hit home  these  safe  songs  safe cd clay  not songs  exception  this night   show ability capture  the songs catchy sure  many enjoy  i expecting  i guess   
4,i love clay aiken s voice  i voted american idol think     win  his talent partially wasted cd  some songs weak  i would love hear sing elton john johnny mathis songs  good  having bought cd  i hope gets better producers next time  he superstar given mediocre song list cd 
4,to jaan uhelszki  amazon editorial reviewer  have ever heard n sync backstreet boys  interpetation  solitaire   hm     
2,i love clay s voice i bought album i buy next  i think album overproduced songs sound  i hope clay s next album brings personal meaning songs  let s voice  i m still huge fan  i think producers missed mark unfortunately 
3,i waited great anticipation clay aiken s first cd  while i fear people behind making clay would corner narrow music genre i really n t   light pop   i held hope would music imspirational voice  well  thank god voice  fact i simply get enough  i would probably listen album  i still love hold hope next better 
5,amazon  thank rushing cd  arrived yesterday i listened constantly carefully  way  repeating song several times  find i tear away listen next  love album  think clay reviewed best talk show comment   progression improvement  previously sung  and  i thought perfection before what beautiful tribute dad s memory  the songs definitely similar  yet could stand alone  and song amazingly lovingly offered  each song makes listener feel special now i know brits yelled prince charles princess diana leaving hospital prince william s birth   do  give us another   the only way improve songs would see clay perform  live  video  guest appearane  suit  stripes  sweats  would n t matter 
2,i looking forward clay s first full cd  wow  disappointment    bland excitement tracks  only   cheap trick  his glow sure dimming best  this night best repeated album   he could much better   whahhhhh guess i expected much 
3,i think clay best voices i ve heard long time  cd n t i expecting  i suppose i hoping broadway feel  album much pop ballad cd  dare i say   sappy  do n t get wrong  sometimes i like sappy  overdone  i still love clay  i hope next album little experimental 
1,stop buying clay s fame      this cd definitely  stars  l  ike someone said earlier  read musiccritics reviews purchase whoever bought copies thiscd fool idiot  actually would make whole called  clay nation  purchasing multiple copies sick campaign buy clay fame  where trust histalent  please leave alone purchase cd theway normal fans would buy favorite artist see happens  you hurting  making think s franklyit s embarrassing  to see strutting stooping straining switching mike hand hand trying work feeling songs  lol  s big jokein house  we actually party laughing guy i love justin timberlake  beyonce others  purchase two copies cd totally rediculous  stop buying clays way top  leave him alone    
1,i big clay aiken fan anxiously awaited full cd  unfortunately  cd i expected  apparently  rushed job none songs really appeal  the cd bland  uninspiring totally i expected  i expected hopefully next cd better 
2,i think s shame enormous talent like clay aiken pigeon hold making album like  measure of a man   aiken s voice soaring wonderous throughout disc  lyrics arrangements track  excluding  this is the night  title track  downright insipid  think backstreet boys go broadway  clive davis  album s head producer bonafide hitmaker  even hang head shame allowing drivel sold aiken s fans  from interviews i ve read seen tv featuring  clay seems like decent human  voice mealt heart  but  i strongly advice serious music lovers avoid disc wait something mature stronger musically clay aiken vocal wonder 
5,this excellent c d  it s great helping relax my favourite songs  measure man    the way   as people said  s real american idol  the bad thing c d n t put kinda upbeat version invisible but s good s music beginning  invisible  though i would like get christmas c d clay sings  the first nol   i heard preview website sounds really good  i m obsesed clay     
4,i would make sound like board defend clay aiken wanted say comparing josh groban like comparing apples oranges  josh groban fine powerful voice s trained voice study years  clay s natural gift proven versatile singer total entertainer  sing anything given make own i josh groban fan i much wonder much clay effortless renditions it seemed ridiculous compare pop singer neo classic style like josh groban  would compare celine dion charlotte church andrea bocelli 
5,at first i disappointed song i familiar this is the night     now  i love them all   this album great i find humming songs time   i would venture guess run to me become classic    around long  long time   also  anyone comment clay s looks  he darling    if anyone watched radio music awards tonight  oct  looked appearance characters    appreciate attractive guy    he sweetie   ready another album  clay   hope working next  maybe next mixture old new    already anxiously awaiting next album    clay appeals age groups   i teenager  i buy three albums     two gifts    anyone buys measure man disappointed    it truly great   
4,i seen final episode us idols starred clay reuben  after seeing capable episode i really stood behind  although i bit hesitant n t stand that much i purchased ablum  surprise s really good  clay brilliant singer  i like songs cd i would recommend re buy cd someone fan idols show  loves pop  clay s cd n t disappoint 
5,double platinum awarded good morning america clive davis rca     wow    so well deserved    great cd clay aiken      i love songs  well done    you hear clays voice beautifully  i happy clay  getting listen measure of a man day long    i highly recomend cd    
5,beautiful album   clay measures up  could finaly seeing change music industry  i think time bring back music thats sex  drugs  singers potty mouths  clays nice young does nt drink  smoke swear  a good role model kids  he s afraid express faith god faith plays big role life  clay hearts millions beautiful voice  novemberth is clays birthday  happy birthday clay       we love you  
4,at first i bit disappointed  but i listened cd many times find really good tracks  clay s fan base diverse producers trying something everyone cd  therefore  bound fan likes better others  i hope next cd include great songs clay al  like solitary  buttercup  etc  i find clay s voice powerfully moving entertaining cd i n t wait next 
5,the true clay fans love cd  it songs apeal country pop fans well people love power ballad  this cd shows clays diversity true power voice  it showcases ability put much emotion song make cry  one warning though put cd player n t able stop playing  if indication clay i n t wait next cd  it amazing debut cd 
4,clay done great job   pretty nice  pop songs  he seems comfort zone song  stylist   a couple songs sound digitized synthesized odd sound  song   would good cher  country singer  as real fan voice  i wish better songs  the songs neither hip  un hip   just middle of of road vanilla songs   probably catalog limited   on balance  least  good  listen over and over songs  showcase voice talent 
2,clay true talent   i sure grow  mature great singer  but cd full pop fluff   show stopping numbers found   clay pop star   westend broadway show delivering show stopping number number  and reviewer said   even  solitaire  n t included  pop song show true range talent    as american idol creators   re slowing seeing winners fade oblivion   even clay says new cd effort invisible   
5,clay awesome performer inspiration family  made special education teacher thank love clay eventhough n t know   
5,this cd fantastic  he awesome voice  i impressed way sang songs got excited  clay  clay really  and going win music sales cd favorites time 
2,simon fuller done  taken average mediocre talent turned media made powerhouse hometown glory over promoted love ballads  as former idol stars kelly clarkson  runner up ironically better selling album  justin guarini  aiken s album filled rare uptempo ballad  medium tempo moody ballads crooning slow colorless ballads  even linear notes all too predictable  thanking family god  sure make middle aged housewife grandma swoon overall  aiken s  measure man  undeniably shows aspiring talent work  denying voice   lack creative inspiration even anything box perhaps shows aiken n t actually measured could quite yet if re aging house wife grandparent ll absolutely love cd  musical taste whatsoever ll avoid completely 
3,the album overproduced lacks clarity focus clay s live performances american idol  the record producer watered beautiful voice sound like boy pop stars drowned overdone background vocals orchestration  the reason buy album give shot another chance 
5,if really know experts say  read review clay s album billboard com music reviewer cites album the best album   does n t get better   i m expert  i love listening anything clay sings  do wish though producers album included solitaire  along couple classics  this voice angel   right material soar beyond heavens  looking forward next album 
5,i highly recommend album any clay aiken fan  i watched clay day  entered room simon  randy paula  declared  american idol   in opinion  is american idol  i could wait album released i not disappointed  the first three songs wonderful   one favorites  measure man   title song cd  this first album i predict next even better  congratulations  clay  release first album  i look forward watching soar thru charts 
4,personally  i find reviews site clay haters arguing clay fans  vice versa  what i think needs done  step back  look cd different way do like cd  obviously hate clay  s way re going like cd s  if love clay  n t going hate it look like  this cd clay  he puts message  personality  voice music  if like  like  if n t  n t  do n t biased either way  look middle point  we n t getting anywhere arguing clay fans  buy cd  you ll adore it clay haters  n t  you ll dispise 
5,i could wait buy cd well worth wait  i listened dozen time love songs  even though cd rushed i think great  means next cd even better 
1,yes  question clay s talent  that s given  however  album n t show  his singles fabulous disappoint us album  you n t even tell song ends next begins  it s stuff  c mon now give songs capable delivering spine tingling sensations 
2,i m big american idol fan i bought cd  but obsessed hard clay aiken   disappointed  i think accentuate twang go country audience  this cd nothing schmaltzy  drab  mediocre  so n t listen raves without realizing clay s nutty fans think s second coming 
1,i m sorry teen enjoy lispy southern high school reject like em think s crap   n t get wrong  appreciate forms music clay ok singing voice style belongs broadway musical   would best sandra dee grease m sure   s funny like show  
1,sorry clay  i kept open mind   cd corny  wimpy collection out dated pop  clay stayed red haired  freckle faced   eyed christian singer  they turned blonde  spiky haired howdy doody  my friends i say      clay no way       
1,this cd hurrendous  ruben so much better  want good cd  check soulful 
5,a cd i listen without skipping any songs  i like  true  much departure would expect ai clay aiken  beginning long successful recording performing career clay  many us disenfranchised long music industry  is industry paying attention  have heard us loud enough  we soul beauty back music  we someone n t spewing filth profanity children  and someone conscience beyond making money  clay answered requests  this money well spent   favorite  the way   ca n t wait hear clay movie soundtracks see solo tours 
4,i love clay since i first saw american idol  what i mean  love  i love voice  personality  stage presence   i think importantly  values  his album good  solid first effort  but  i hate say     s missing something  it s definitely well produced  voice beautiful always  but i think s lacking songwriting  alot songs sounded  n t different i thought would ve hearing mainstream pop last several years  i defintely listen album  especially work day  but i think clay s team better next time around  and  heck  solitaire    i heard going album  looking forward hearing long version  nowhere found    
5,this cd way higher expectations  i n t quit listening  clay s voice shines  s overproduction    it s clay  and s fell love  i d recommend cd best friend  little sister  grandmother  definitely something ages 
5,one best cds heard long time  far surpasses ai performances  this cd consistently excellent material throughout  i d recommend cd anyone 
4,i listened measure man clay aiken three times skipped songs  i n t think i ever done cd  it enjoyable terrific job first time i looking forward future cd s i know get better experience  i reserving star later hopefully rca lets clay clay 
5,the first time i listened cd  i little disappointed n t really type thing clay american idol  i ve listened non stop despite fact  i admit  i love  there really cool songs  i love upbeat  invisible     no more sad songs  probably favorites  reminds powerful paul mccartney ballad  if mccartney cd  flaming pie  enjoyed  seems kinda similar  definitely powerful something get sick fast  i like fact songs relate avoid negative images record companies try impose us listeners  we always trust clay give us knows really  thank you clay 
4,do n t get wrong  clay amazing voice  there s reason guy   american idol  but songwriters need shot creativity  his lyrics  though heartfelt i m sure  generic topics every pop star sings  love loss  these generally great topics  s whole cd  i hope next cd   variety concerning song topics  i m still giving cd  stars voice blows majority faults away  i d buy christmas cd i money 
4,five stars clay  three stars producers chose material  thus gets four stars  this guy sing anything sound totally original breathtaking every time  he big sony  produced   let s  there two hits  sad songs awesome  signature song sung finale  night  the rest pleasure listen  simply clay wrong  he undoubtedly next manilow diamond  cash cow record company would n t hold back giving best material  hopefully album prove n t let next packed top material 
5,i got cd today i love  i think something everyone  the songs beautiful listen song measure man see i talking about clay breath fresh air  i sick tired able listen radio buy cd s littered filth  i love fact clay taking stand kind garbage fed kids 
5,clay s cd everything could  a stunningly beautiful voice  great lyrics  great songs  clay s voice highly recognizable listening bring emotion life song  you play cd  my favs invisible  i carry  the way  this night  measure  etc  etc  all songs  shine   i never get tired listening  n t wait see store us later  everyone buy cd  you n t dissapointed    clay  beautiful voice  beautiful talent  truly beautiful 
3,clay s new cd  measure man  nice i expecting totally different types songs  he awesome singer i expecting high volume songs low  his single cd big hit i hope cd n t bring down still  clay fan  
5,even though n t win season  american idol  s kinda like  there many reasons i say  his album done dropped people acturally buy  he s done videos ruben    he already tour  so  many ways  winner along  i love cd i listen all time  i m going song song review like i usually i  i however  tell favorite songs  this is the night  bonus cut   the way  when you say you love me  insivible  i pobability favorite songs i  i edit review up to date review i love clay   go clay   if love clay like kelly clarkson  season winner  
4,i n t sure i going like cd i knew would n t contain older pop songs like clay sang ai competition  after first listen  i loved n t stopped listening least since october there s little bit everything cd  something every taste  my favorite cuts the way  when you say you love me  touch  invisible  measure a man  i will carry you this the night  clay handles vocals like s singing years  he sings passion feeling clay said interviews wants record songs meaningful lyrics great melodies  he true word i never doubt 
5,i n t liked much recent american pop  clay sure good singer  i watched perform  invisible  billboard awards   i completely blown away  simply amazing  a friend sent this the night bridge over troubled water single earlier year  amazing well  good work  clay  hope future albums excellent well 
5,clay aiken arrived   definate flair pop   this knows sell song   understands hold back   understands hit  money note    songs like  invisible    touch  great pop songs  radio friendly   the way    touch  right amount sex  sells song   measure a man  give glimpse future mature individual  and course  signature song  this night   still gives chills first glimpses soul individual each song album unique  however  together  create incredible debut album this artist  much offer  i n t wait see clay aiken give pop music next 
4,like  measure man breath fresh air  perfect day distinctive track  diverting power ballad style clay aiken perfected  sure hit charts  reminds elton john bit    this night continues evoke strong emothions even several months first heard  my criticism clay top notch vocalist risks style   surely succeed   pipes like  could 
4,i honestly say i pleasantly surprised album  after avidly watching american idol  i expected clay s first cd sound   well  like barbara streisand like  being fan rock punk pop  seem like good thing  however  sound anything like  outdated  musicians    should enjoyed anyone call lover music  even usually listen pop music  definitely give chance 
5,i honestly never bought cd i liked songs  well  changed  this cd bad song  clay shows arrived  he stayed true stay  highly recommend  
3,i disappointed cd i know clay capable sounding much powerful  his incredible voice drowned background vocals music much time i think future albums would benefit stronger songwriting better arrangements  i  expecting  solitaire  sound  maybe help neil sedaka  neil diamond  richard carpenter    so far favorite cut  no more sad songs   i admit  i listen  i like 
5,you know artist popular garners many reviews many people love hate guy rising star  it took lot guts get front panel judges audition american idol even guts sing front simon rest america  this album contains songs different genres popular music s something everyone  i personally love  give chance  i m sure not disappointed we gave clay chance look  and keep saying s ugly  good look mirror see s inside 
5,i bought this album as soon as it hit the store and as soon as i listened to it i loved every track  im sick of listening to the stuff the disc jocks think are good singers  rap and the yelling and cursing for shock value to sell something and call it talent  i like all types of music as long as the singing is good and the music is good but so many pop and rock stations dont know what is true artistic work any more  im not saying its all bad but too much of it is  clay was wonderful to listen to on the show and even better on the new album  its rare to find an album that all the songs are good but clay has done it and i will nodoubt buy everything he puts out in the future i continue to leave this cd in my car player and listen to it over and over 
5,  measure man  debuted no   billboard named cd best pop album  why n t buy clay aiken s cd  i guarantee love lyrics  music  clay s wonderful voice  high low notes  emotion brings tracks  absolutely takes another place   perfect day    shine  beatlesque songs  i m sure  songs well   invisible  catchy song already well radio states  hopefully  radio stations play often soon  my favourite   measure man   a wonderful song makes stop think buy clay aiken today  n t regret 
5,the song choices cd excellent  as album playing  i could n t decide track i liked better  not since beatles i able say honestly i loved every songs  invisible  the way  when you say you love me  measure man  touch incredible  i hope first long string great albums  well done  clay  well done 
2,this really great voice  n t get wrong   i n t think album people waste money on yes  i fan josh groban deal  i think cd crappy songs crappy lyrics  i mean invisible  clay wanting watch room  that kind freaks  i n t guy wall watching undressed clay got american idol become famous person  if n t show would still nobody teacher  he normal voice  nothing someone church choir n t have i think going blow money real music  buy josh groban  yea  sing different languages  translate great meanings  and even get addicted italian  at least josh speak another language  heh 
1,this cd disappointed  i expecting clay i guess happens rush work  i hope next better sucked 
1,this album full oversung sappy  cheesy lyrics  horrible production ai machine  where find songwriters  and could clay enunciate little  yes  n t sing sex  s singing invisible watching someone room      scary 
1,on behalf randy paula producers american idol i humbly apologize besieging america crap 
1,this cd full rockish country old stuff  i really think clay makes good pop star cd proves 
1,it s easy  re possibilities like album  you re little gal early teens  think s  well  cute   you know zilch music  you re trying victim mushrooming commercial music i m sick of did ever feel rush blood oozing heart  no  then songs probably dun impress much 
1,clay aiken   big  answer  american idol  did win  answer  no  then bigger ruben  answer  s miracle  number  admit  looks sort like clown  two  even feet huge  they look like joke  but  i realize nothing singing  what i think singing  awful  every song sounds  everyone else would realize normal really  d know nothing worth buying  if real music  go buy michael buble s debut album  s guy real talent  clay aiken screaching clown somehow scored record deal  i give star fact actual cd case  someone make 
1,uh oh claymates    clay s album fallen top twenty sellers amazon com    quick  better buy ten copies get back  because know judge greatness record many copies get sold   not  
1,this album complete waste clay s voice  all i say reminds watered mix bad air supply meets bad barry manilow  i n t understand motivates outstanding reviews album s worthy  these songs exciting muzak  except clay s music playing elevators  i would forced stairs  i hope next release clay music complement voice 
5,i n t stop listening album  every day favorite song changes  there duds album  clay s wonderful voice combination talented songwriters make cd joy listen 
5,i ve read many reviews posted amazon echo i felt i first heard cd   s best cd i bought long time  i listen moam least   times day clay aiken s voice makes feel happy sounds corny  world live today s nice feel  i n t realize snarky  snotty music industry i read  critics  reviews cd i guess i n t get it  s wrong pure  honest talent   do favor buy cd the way  shine  i will carry you  i survived you fact whole cd excellent  i never skip song i start day cd  i cd clay  next time make double cd  quickly 
5,i followed clay american idol process start finish i say i hope begining long successful career  this cd fabulous well worth wait  there n t bad song voice simply mesmerizing  i think several songs could hits  anyway slice  i buy many cd s young records  not easy forty something woman admit    i going purchase idols christmas cd clay song  my advice  buy  n t sorry 
5,i personally found best cd s ever listened  clay aiken true american idol  wonderful young positve outlook message  how refreshing  i recently tried get concert tickets tour kelly clarkson n c  find sold  instead i driving washington d c  year old birthday concert mci center  his voice beautiful almost reverant  i would give cd stars allowed     
2,i clay fan i hear karoake music  this album chances self imposed pop idol  hecame second i see 
2,i really hoped would fabulous  n t  all songs sound  same tempo  back ground back up  rca whoever told clay sing type songs way base  when done live  song  clay know  where  unchained melody   one songs got top two idol included 
2,i really like clay aiken i found cd  measure man  boring  i quite disapointed songs album general  i enjoy watching listening clay tv  i think sweet i like singing cd 
1,dear mr clay  you cd great cd  you voice plesant  you talentd singer  you hot fat like rubin dude  i wish look hope make another grate cd soon  you win garmmys  bye bye 
2,the first time i saw clay american idol  audition  i said  theres winner   the first time i listened clay s album  i said  theres winner turned junky commercialized pop culture phenomena  exploited traditional sappy songs handed writers  oversung way person sung songs tv sound exactly   poor clay small dose  fine voice  heck  could make really good broadway performer ability belt em  it s prefabricated crap like cd makes spew a star clay s talent  pity  this album truly deserves credit  none came heart 
4,this excellent debut album  the songs selected ai completed exhausted clay already recording two weeks later  i seen clay grown artist performer past months  if album go double platinum  i shiver think next  there lot time work songs production  i love songs  moam favorite  everyone family heard album asked christmas stocking stuffer 
3,after reading many reviews i see market cd   but  us truly appreciate amazing voice unique personality  know better needs better management  those say best cd ever please listen josh groban s first album  i happy clay wonderful idol young kids  everyone knows need   us really know music  please give us album really uses clay s voice drowned noisy busynoise music variety worthy talents 
3,it s pretty obvious clay sings producer written songs show skills singing  by  many songs oversung without true artistic feelings towards  makes many songs sounds dull commonplace  i slightly dissappointed voice sounded cd  n t good i thought  although many songs catchy  clay makes sound nothing unique even destroys alot good music  overall  cd attract much people  i thought s little overated common
3,his voice awsome  true  clay songs   i n t expect get sunk pressure  pop star  we fell love clay could sing anything great emotion  why producing songs pretty boys  clay  next time remind us better 
3,the cd o k  i like songs used  clay much better voice music allowed 
2,wife i bought cd weekend word comes mind depressing  it none great tunes i expected likes clay  always known use ballads   many songs need losing love making without   blah blah blah i expected powerhouse tunes  wish could done music perhaps upcoming disney movie  
2,while i love tracks cd admire writers producers involved  darren hayes  desmond child  cathy dennis  danielle brisbois  aldo nova   almost every song sounds  and clay annoying habit  finishing  every song performed live  maybe s i kind like  used  fade outs pop songs  i definetly like clay s voice standout songs actually effected  title track especially moved  i say kelly clarkson s debut cd head shoulders better produced collection middle road  unoffensive  generic collection milquetoast  i expected clay first single  better luck next time 
1,it hurts see clay fall like  the momentum leading cd release great leads disappointment  it s clay s fault  i blame media hype surrounding release clay could anything fail please waste hard earned money trash  josh grobin s cd much satisfying 
1,i purchased new clay aiken cd i n t think i ever disappointed life  i feel like s beautiful voice even near  capable album  most songs n t even sound like  i waited voice sends goosebumps spine hits  notes   i skipped every song album found none even came close  i hope clay speaks says  measure  next album show cases god given talent  when hear songs like  bridge over troubled water  amazing listen album  even begin compare  the reason i gave star song  this the night    i would rated 
5,what absolutely  wonderful  album  perfection plus    clay knows hear    every single song album beautiful sung emotion  i n t know i ever able pick favorite  i love  okay  next album going released 
4,i read couple articles new clay aiken album  measure man  i say i dissappointed people bashing albums songs  personally  i love album  i think sing song make sound fantastic  amazing talent  maybe everyone stop critizing think  start appreciating truly  gifted singer strong solid voice 
2,hun  cd nothing special  it essential cd like beatles  supremes  aretha  he cd hit wonder huns 
1,after listening first songs album i ve waiting months  i look make sure i picked up right  it n t even sound like  ironic since audience liked way sounds    the songs could use help  least used songs serious song writers  desmond child  let s hope clay hang around enough go way sound way 
1,this cd spectacular disappointment  clay huge  pure voice  cd works hard cancel  overproduced underbalanced  every song marred pervasive  tinny whitenoise  drummer told keep cymbals hissing every song  this fuzzes clay s pure  clear tone  cancels every nuance emotional musical resonance  it s producer arrangers n t trust voice carry  what idiots  clay seems like smart kid  hopefully s smart enough choose another producer next cd 
2,i prepare wrath clay fans  i think cd disappointment clay s voice watered tracks   sound something  like  clay   this probably attempt attract crowd simon thought clay could n t attract  producers writers may garnered clay new fans expense old ones i think would sold million pre sale copies many us heard entire cd  this cd justin timberlake lite  s compliment  no diane warren sedaka style songs  someone listened demo cd  ai heaven s sake  order put together debut worthy clay s voice if continues  i ex clay fan  or  i say  i remain ai clay fan  forever waiting back form anyway  i know many like cd   let 
3,no doubt  clay s voice amazing  the content debut album minimal though  you tell songs chosen shopped around many artists  hand tailored clay  frankly  i m tired hearing gay musicians sing women  it sounds really unconvincing  we ve seen previously will young s album  american idol winner europe  but around  clay s debut album easy going worth playing office working home 
1,clay aiken s bombastic  top singing style bad enough make baby jesus cry  if re tween demented middle age soccer mom  i recommend pass buying album patooey 
2,clay aiken outstanding voice  n t showcased  this another bland pop cd full predictable top songs  i wish best  i certainly hope next effort reflect amazing talent show imagination 
3,this cd delivers exactly intended  it s really good pop cd  combining catchy tunes clay s incredible voice  background little loud  clay s voice soars  especially love clay s emotion  the way   awesome  this great first effort  many  thanks clay  really delivered 
5,a showcase mr aiken s exceptional voice  power pop album singing along time  every cut potential top hit  s something everyone  power chord filled ballad run to me   beatle esque shine  perfect day   country flavored when you say you love me   breathtakingly beautiful love ballad the way   a tiny disappointment fan  mr aiken s lower register barely evidence  still  n t stop album  en joy able 
3,first  i do like clay admire wonderful voice  this cd  however  small disappointment though nice surprises cd  wonder cd really clay wanted make given rushed months camend american idol season two  did really get songs s  dreamed  make album s  dreamed  short time  doubtful some songs great hooks s several upbeat tunes   s guitars  some songs rather bland melodies alarming lack heart soul endeared clay america so s missing  a little bit soul  interesting varied arrangements  and backing vocals  additional vocals add texture  variation  bit depth  soul song compare kelly clarkson s cd  hear bit soul immediately get feeling she made cd wanted make 
4,well  like i first listened cd impressed  there good tracks  seem go hill cd goes along  i particularly dissapointed lifeless rendition  this night   after amazing live performance song show  recorded version dead boring  clay amazing voice cd certainly n t seem portray passion music like live performances  still  i love voice  amazing singer  hopefully next cd bring mind blowing vocals know clay aiken  long short  if love clay s worth buying cd  n t expect idol like performance 
1,does matter get  it s impossible say aiken would sound different atop virtual mount mckinley worked way wrote songs  i think would  sameness tracks alive echoes anechoic chamber  how spell  sucks   
5,if musical tastes run terrific songs sung stunningly beautiful voice  album  it s quality product beginning  a bit retro without ever sounding dated  song album allows different facet aiken s talent shine  if loved journey  ll thrilled run me  if remember beatlemania  ll adore shine  and yet  aiken always  uniquely  if know anything history  ll know no more sad songs  seemingly breakup song  probably different meaning aiken  if know anything values  ll understand measure man title track  this  without doubt  enjoyable pop album i ve heard long time 
5,every song cd wonderful  aiken proves real talent still exists purchasing album  along earlier single bridge over troubled water   wonder many people love  i look forward future albums  aiken idol   
5,i think clay aiken best thing happened music long time  this cd great i listen  clay fantastic singer  great person sincere  giving wonderful around good human  i looking forward many cds  i looking forward attending solo concert tomorrow evening sioux falls  sd  ca n t wait 
5,clay s first cd wonderful  it showcases range uniqueness voice  invisible touch upbeat easily danced  the way measure man highlight clay s ability ballads like  when you say you love me bit country flavour shine i survived you edgier side  the cd gets better better everytime listen clay sings every song passion emotion  a great first album 
5,clay s cd magnificent  i honestly say bad track album  everytime listen  gets better better  invisible touch upbeat make get dance  when you say you love me little bit country flavour the way measure man pure ballads  and clay n t sing lyrics  lyrics  it showcases amazing range uniqueness voice  listen cd times agree wonderful first album clay aiken 
3,i wish bridge over troubled water included  i love clay s voice  songs lacked something  he so talented 
2,i tried listening cd still could find liking anything  soumd alike boring  arrangements horrible mediocre anyone used good music n t make sense in fairness clay awesome powerful voice  deserve crap songs hope would look seriously  please realize fans varied bunch teenyboppers older ones discriminating tastes  happen  though loved ai performances really expecting something would appealing enjoyable  sadly find nothing makes listen again i hope second cd better quality w good vocal musical arrangement  better songs would showcase clay s singing talent 
1,first let start saying clay favorite american idol  i thoght  still think  beat ruben  now well could member bubble gum band n sync the one star clays great voice  lack  stars giving teeny bopper sound 
1,measure man read measure boy  his  so called  music recycled previous performers n sync  backstreet boys  etc  is n t anyone original voice original music write  this guy even worth watching i witnessed night jay leno s  tonight show  give marvin gaye  otis redding  even luciano pavarotti  at least guys sing soul lot heart  something kid learn releases another song  even year old kids n t get guy s singing  sorry clay 
1,i huge clay fan  i extremely disappointed cd  the sing like else  sing songs less stellar  say least  give great songs sing  ll right 
2,admitedly  mesmerizing voice  however  still lacks ability grasp nuances emotions shown songs sings  he s born singer needs get technical skills singing could labeled american idol   unlike clay  josh groban  though yet fully polished  could easily control pianissimo forte  melt heart  you n t worry would make embarrassing kinks performance  as another comparison  kelly clarkson s performance firm solid  she s qualified true artist  clay n t 
3,being big fan pop music american idol general  i quite disappointed see clay cover d side s  invisible  he tune well  shame see cover single boyband just also released single well uk  tisk tisk 
3,i began watching american idol coworker raved clay  i continued watch voice beautiful heartbreaking  i waited cd thank heaven i listened clips first internet i knew buy it his glorious voice changed bland  ordinary  sounds like every pop star voice songs average  i afraid rca would him i gave cd  stars s average rating average cd  if clay sung cd way sang show would n t enough stars sky rate 
1,there song cd impressed  i expected clay aiken  his voice drowned music half time lyrics capture attention  in words  track i found humming singing later i force fed whole cd get monies worth  i dissappointed  not worth buying  hopefully  next album entertaining least bearable  i fan 
3,i like clay aiken  he darn good singer  but album average  it ground breaking  i expected better  almost songs sound alike    shine     i will carry you     run to me    the songs n t give ability show voice  the album sounds rushed  the best songs  invisible   catchy tempo    the way   it sounds like could possibly classic definately great song    measure man   delivers strong message    this night   it pales comparison kelly clarkson fantasia  their albums much put together 
5,clay aiken got best singer world  i love dude  his first cd  measure man   absolutely awesome   it includes hit songs ivisible   the way   when you say you love me   no more sad songs   measure man   not songs cd awesome showcase display voice  appropriate  cussing inappropriate references  i m proud clean staying true values  kudos clay  go buy cd today  you regret   
5,i really like measure of a man much  thing i kids i play loud n t worry anything bad said  my daughter loves singing along clay  great cd    my mom likes much    clay thank much  truly     thank much   
5,i bought moam soon came i love  it s amazing disc n t worn already  when  i buy another  lol   clay sings feeling song touches soul  as jaan  i really upset  if like clay  giving review album  you idea talking  i agree others  amazon let go  besides  yet discover clay  n t  may swayed comments would shame 
2,i like  touch  best   this night     invisible  pretty good  i m  invisible   the rest cd runs together  i get feeling clay  although good voice  little emotion tends toward glory held notes impress  my least favorite  idol cds i  even justin s gets played often 
1,ca n t hide disappointment cd  i looking forward  especially attending idol concert raleigh  unfortunately cd clay overpowered background singers  there diversity  most songs sound  as older fan i hoping classic numbers like clay sang tv series  i n t listening cd  hopefully whoever responsible learn experience produce something let clay shine reach entire audience next cd 
1,worst album heard since barry manilow  clay snow job american people witrh crap put songs meaning  give back money clay  kelly clarkson far better junk wants listen  go back georgia red clay 
2,that bad star clay aiken c d really borring songs sound  one listen album enought say n t waste money c d really peace nothing 
2,this cd huge disappointment  clay awesome voice  cd little show true talent  the songs average best lack kind melodies would truly show clay s gift  i ve read many reviews cd recent stated  it lacks luster probably get lost pile old cd s  good luck next time clay producing appropriate music awesome voice 
1,i liked better american idol  i m glad others like cd s really well charts 
1,i agree woman reviewed album  it sounds like backstreet boys nsync music recreated  been done  clay needs step game wants last music industry longer 
4,this cd great  still think deserved win  shows  albums like way ever matched 
5,i n t remember cd recent years mushroom effect wonderful cd  it s popularity grows grows  i see  i listened cd month straight  i ca n t stop playing it   what wonderful vocal ability  it wonder cd continually registers top best sellers  it deserves it if hear wonderful  uplifting  fresh music  generally amazing singing  buy measure man  you n t disappointed 
5,this absolutely everything i waiting  it ballads pop songs pleasant surprise  bit rock edge  i normally heavy metal girl friends family hard time understanding clay obsession truly represents whose talent goes beyond presented american idol  very impressive clayton  
4,while i really follow american idol  i decided give cd listen hearing  invisible  radio seeing clay s video tv  i really surprised voice coming young  his debut cd polished sounding  i really like beat  invisible     i will carry you  positive song i smile i hear  when you say you love me   the rest cd groundbreaking  still worth listen clay s smooth  powerful delivery  thanks
4,i never watched american idol i rarely listen pop music  i clicked cd day listened clips see fuss  i liked i heard  bought  i played every day since  there s something  s bad track  is well crafted  lyrically sophisticated cd made year  no  entertaining  catchy  let s  clay s voice could make phone book sound good  there n t anything going appeal everyone  if like hear clips  re going like whole cd 
5,after listenting cd since numerous times daily   i enjoy song every time i listen cd   the way    run me    shine    touch  front runners right i enjoy songs  why clay intesting  eyes  mouth incredible voice   can guy sing yes  i saw clay concert ai tour  quality comes wows crowd holds thru every performance done first cd  i continue buying music wonderful qualities    you go clay  and heard sing  noel  holiday cd missing probably best verison song i ever heard    makes stand shout heavens  clay measures every way true entertainer every way possible 
1,i sorry cd work  you better buying single mp listen  buying complete cd waste 
2,sings good  sings bad songs  good song the way 
1,actually i love potato chips   plain sucks  what wrong people   must follow everything  reality  show tells  and guy supposeldy freakin  lost  there s something wrong folks  when society reduced low forget classics beethoven mozart concertos  classic rock like floyd zepplin  even modern music like dream theater nightwish   something wrong american society just like potato chips   n t know frell stop 
1,wow  can hear   listen  listen carefully  the music kelly clarkson s album  different lyrics clay singing instead kelly  can i somebody  
2,there artistry first endeavor  some lyrics painfully odd aiken s delivery lacks depth  texture  nuance  finesse  diversity  yes  guy sing  interesting singer  he certainly original  i get sense real emotion behind delivery  i feel like i m sung rather sung  i admit never fan glory noting brand singing  aiken solidifies conviction i n t find interesting ai even less debut  aiken proclaimed artist  guy reality show  so far  s confirmed limitations musical aspirations as sales  well  mcdonalds sells alot burgers   n t make burgers better quality  nothing s wrong enjoy fast food burger  please enjoy  n t insist s filet mignon 
3,this cd alright   average   disapointed songs cd sound sometimes think ve listening songs last  i dissapointed back ground music floods voice  he talented cd n t let show  yet   songs really like would recommend n t mind slow songs 
5,buy it      he s great singer american idol    disappointed 
2,i n t think guy sucks completely pretty overrated  i read articles saying next elvis presley  hahahaha  s funny  i see next richard marx s never gon king triumph the insult comic dog said best    ruben clay  pick  it s like choosing puddle vomit lick   
1,think back final american idol ii  trying spot top  i remember clay group kimberly locke ruben studdard  clay habit enunciating cost slot final  losing kimberly ruben  however  aiken extremely lucky  got second chance  blows us away  now  comes first album measure man   can i say  clay trying get top ten songs  d sent home hopefully  would n t get second chance  this first release proves never another wildcard  someone deserving  talented  consistent  simply person range loud louder n t make great consistent singer  i give clay credit    yell long singing  must lot voice shows 
1,i broke cold sweat listening album  i n t like album surly agree 
5,just fantastic  you n t disapointed  the  true  winner ai shines   there n t bad song album  i could n t pick favorite  what waiting   go get it 
5,i found cd excellent  i always enjoy hearing talented singers  the songs helped make drive  i listen music car  relaxing experience  he good voice lot natural talent  i think great album test wings improve upon  i m sure ll get better  i m looking forward follow work 
3,simply put  clay aiken s voice bigger better cd  while song choices fine  n t show talent fullest  disappointment lies  what clive davis thinking picked somewhat mediocre melodies  obviously  n t know mr aiken  i n t think knows american idols  quite frankly  these people sing big dogs  n t let  but back measure man the voice ten  least   the songs six if love voice  buy cd  n t regret  ll wish songs could match voice   if love clay aiken  buy  n t regret  ll wish songs could match  if re wishy washy either  n t give  wait see else team clay comes

1,oh great america needs  another souless  overhyped talent john mayer wannabe  i n t n t buy cd workong record store i check see fuss  the songs poorly written meaningless  clay sounds belongs highschool production grease  do n t waste time money  if actually like kind drab souless music pick john mayer s new cd  least sounds like talented singer rather aspiring drama queen sore throat 
2,i absolutely love clay s voice  i could n t wait release disappointing debut  but nuances voice make phenomenal hidden underneath  music   i would rather hear clay singing acappella singing anything songs  why cover beautiful voice 
4,i big clay fan  his voice enchanting  however  much like kelly clarkson s cd  clay s cd somewhat lacking  i feel could done much better  almost songs basically thing  celine dion esque sense re      re gon alright   know mean  the best song opinion i survived you   bottom line  it s good cd  little redundant

5,i like songs first listened found three songs i really like touch  wish would play radio   measure man  country music sounding do love  look forward hearing solitare soon 
5,it s time artist gave us music everyone enjoy  the pop music business  part  thinks people hear negative images  i feeling sales cd prove people positive music  it s refreshing able actually understand lyrics feel uncomfortable listening  three generations family  taken  clay aiken n t wait hear  i highly recommend cd 
5,clay aiken around many years  his first cd  measure n t bad track  every songs suited clay s ballad style voice  i think best albums i ve heard long time  invisible  shine  measure man  great   clay stay 
5,clay aiken s outstanding voice song delivery showcased perfectly cd  his vocal power range phenomenal songs terrific well  at long last  person rises top charts actual possession real talent  at long last  major label produced cd recognition content music mature without trash treating vices though re  indeed  acceptable  it s long time since i ve listened pop simple reason i tired wading filth innuendo hear bars i liked  clay aiken appeals true emotion feeling  this came today already  i m anxiously waiting next cd 
1,listen watch video  invisible  see pre fab crapola clay aiken  remember u spontaneous street concert shut police  well  aiken s video  invisible  wants convince us song  invisible   n t much  political relevance cachet police helicopter suddenly rush hold fans bay  it s calculated  guaranteed provide voice  deserves better  seem dangerous  although danger carefully accounted  oh  clay s dangerous  except ask people open wallets song designed hit factory make seem politically relevent  thanks lot  clay  if invisible  oh wait  already 
2,clay aiken kind polished staid crooner fills many lounges his voice absolutely unremarkable  takes absolutely risks  music absolutely sends sleep the best word describe cd ponderous   like clay s songs  holier than thou makes gag  at rap thugs talking pimps crack deals aks  guy comes side  blindfolded  goes good pure untainted sweet life        hello mr aiken  i call saint aiken  see wicked world actually  and close eyes sing meaningless sentimental platter world already seen much  but enough said  do n t buy cd  save money real music 
1,why people like fake music written people person actually singing  this american idol stuff uncreative impotent minds  reality lacks reality  i lisetend songs sure mr aiken good singer  way i buy facade  i listen real music  i mean real music musicians write perform songs 
2,my thrifty  stingy  friend d even throw away month old newspapers gave cd  told i could keep  i suspicious unexpected generosity   my hunch right   every song sounds  stale  corny sleep inducing  i d rather re read month old newspapers unless i trouble sleeping  i ll whip cd i know i ll fall asleep within  songs  faster 
5,this young talented i n t pick favorite i like all i n t help notice amt wrote reviews clays album dtd nt like it no artist gets percent favor clay sure comes close  i ve noticed say n t like really n t like  read reviews  it reads like anger  why express selves way  could wanted fail  i m year old grandma   clay mate i m clay grandma i love cd  grandma pence
3,invisible amazing song   the rest songs n t really compare single 
2,i guess big questuin  sing  he technically proficient  s enough book  he s another cookie cutter singer mediocrity  he s got chops s feeling passion behind  the music s given n t help matters either  cliche lyrics suit voice fine  what makes artists like bob dylan tom waits endearing vocal prowess  lack thereof   s personality infuse music  give clay  visions of johanna    blue valentines  sing  i know  do n t give ideas  songs would rendered lifless exciting used kleenex  songs like n t merely sing  you give something special i n t think clay would able hack real song like  he s another singer 
1,is music industry turned  as zombied brain dead n t ruined enough us know turn television  music capturing intangable  fashion makeovers poor little geek  explore artists creativity junk spoonfed masses  you know ll using cd coaster  months anyway 
1,have always liked clay aiken  songs clay s singing style sound  it extremely non versatile boring effort  compared kelly clarkson excellent thankful cd  clay  thankful  fans helped debut    measure man  truly disappointing cd 
3,i voted clay ai  preferred ruben  however  album slightly dissapointing over rated  clay good voice songs seem like typical fillers  invisible corny  hokey song  measure man run  however  excellent songs  clay shines vocally  but  songs like the way  no more sad songs  shine extremeley generic boring  if re fan american idol buy diana degarmo s blue skies  awesome  ten times better measure man 
1,why n t people shut attacking ever honest reviewer actually listen drab piece junk  so clay sing seems nice guy  that not make mess good album  it lacks everything makes good album like originality  emotion  oh album reflect singer  this album nothing clay  he n t write single word therefore nothing kareoke  exactly sounds  you obsessed people need get clue  clay messiah  n t even real musician  a good singing voice alone artist make  there hundreds equally talented singers commercial jingles  clay got lucky noticed tv show  however tv show  real music fans never fall
3,this cd ok only song i really like invisible  rest bland pop  clay s voice appealing  boy band fans like album 
2,i disappointed cd  clay good voice  cd n t good i expected 
5,i love cd i listen better gets  i certainly got money s worth cd  great going clay  
2,hello  i given cd co worker wanted clay forward proceeds go aiken foundation  i tried objective listens avidly streisand  groban  i new yorker attends broadway plays  opera  i optimistic  clay aiken still young time develop voice  i impressed disc  it light popsy good first showing  i wish young luck future  ll need unless gets better production help  if  maybe i catch broadway shows i attend  he least that good thanks cd sylvia 
2,invisible great song  best song cd  the rest blah sounds  clay nice voice  cd plain boring  broadway clay could never become recording artist without ai hype  he s certainly josh groban  s sure 
1,shame pieces crap feeding well oiled machine manufactured pop crap     i hope realzie clay s lyrics beats written year old     disputing excellent voice     miillions otheres       the reason hes popular america rotten pool television       i love quality television      which rare        but watching american idol prompted garbage number charts       you destroying artists actual musical talent play instruments     comfort douche bags minutes soon     anyways       support bands talent      thank time
2,it s hard believe people buy schtick  between mr aikens  overly dramatic singing really middle of the road songs  n t anything worth hearing  mr aiken might make decent interpretive singer experience better material  maybe next time   
4,i loved clay s singles cd could wait full lenght  i played husband even know clay first two songs i told  it dosent sound like songs  it dose n t powerful clay sound became love  do n t get wrong wonderful cd i hoping power voice like first singles  it s like made change sound bit  i still love music continue buy it i sure next even better new right 
5,i bought cd day came oct i still playing every day  i n t remember ever owning cd i would listen every song still play cd everyday five months later  well worth money i spent it it shame people using review area bash mr aiken selling person actually american idol  i n t watch show i n t say someone would feel need  i bought cd hearing mr aiken s  this night  radio i fell love voice  i looking forward next album 
5,i like debut much  clay win american idol success show  clay reminds young barry manilow  i like clay clean cut guy cd lyrics clean well  s nice refreshing change celebrities music  this wonderful cd  i n t wait see clay s career flourish i hope see clay aiken wonderful career long time  he truly deserves it there lyrics printed cd booklet i n t think really need either  would nice necessary  you hear clay sing lyrics clearly fans like sing along  still i wish record label printed lyrics  would nice addition  the cd booklet pulls poster clay 
5,my favorite  the way   great song delivers   i will carry you  another goodie  there couple songs seem little odd  almost country ish   yuk   still great job them buy cd 
2,i disappointed clay s new cd  not clay  i fan months continue  songs  clay s amazing voice deserves better showcase hastily written  one dimensional tracks  i heard rumor songs would clay s masterful performance neil sedaka s  solitaire   n t appear cd  it s best performance i ve heard  apparently n t  mainstream  enough producers i hope clay able shed  american idol  moniker following insidiously  he average pop star  unfortunately average pop album  clay  true fans  deserve better 
5,this cd packed absolutely wonderful songs  i n t stop playing  there s little bit everything  n t like  skip next track  what i saying  how could love clay aiken 
5,i enjoyed every song album  clay producers great job picking songs showcase clay s wonderful voice  the songs unique i predict several number songs generated cd  congratulations clay  fantastic job  
4,at first hearing album sounded kinda bland  but songs really grow  like clay  have listen  the way     when you say you love me    run me    re songs sing sway  i d certainly album long drives 
5,clay aiken shows still sing songs without language  his respect well others projected well music  i proud raleigh n t wait go concert daughters  yes i mom  to able capture audience ages amazing 
4,this exceptional cd  in today s world  clean cut guy singing clean cut songs  indeed  rare  needless say refreshing  clay s clear voice excels  his voice lyrics complement  as cd s songs like others  i favorites cd  i strongly disagree rating i read local newspaper giving cd d  all i say

5,if you have n t already bought this cd  you need too      every song excellent clay s talent proved  beat ruben  also  the american idol holiday cd awsome

4,this album perfectly done  solid mid tempo power ballads uptempo last song  touch   sound funky  it lates feel  reminiscent michael bolton reign hits  clay makes feel every word  every lyric  s gone situations loved   invisible  bon jovi feel loud  bombastic guitars  would sounded good  and  the way  sounds beautiful gorgeous landscapes  liked title song  country flavored  when you say you love me     run to me     shine     perfect day   whitesnake sounding  i will carry you  others  this star right selling like crazy album  hope next album exciting 
5,clay amazing talent  this rapidly become favorite cd  i listen i traveling  time  if enjoy listening inspirational songs pure wonderfully gifted young artist  cd  enjoy 
5,this album wonderful  each song winner  the i listen better gets 
4,as ai watchers know  clay sing anything  but best performances  solitare  ones instrmentation sparse voice  star  clay s best tracks  touch  when you say  moam  perfect day  voice carries day  worst  run me  beat  music overpower song  smaltzy over processed pop   he deserves better adult contemporary songs try dress new micheal bolton  on future outings  hopefully label let clay experiment diverse songwriters styles  maybe even something accapella  rca   allow power  range  phrasing makes clay s voice special shine  i  however  love  the way   rca witty  personable star voice hands  do n t let clay his voice get lost glitzy world over stylized pop 
3,this review comes major claymate  i went release party october could n t wait get hands album  i sure would blow away   n t  the songs good voice  always  fabulous  album lacking  when i listen track i find anticipating next track     yet never  this album could absolutely great two songs really voice justice  clay s album desperately needed powerhouse ballad i m disappointed n t measure man  do n t misunderstand  regret purchasing album  however  like enjoy clay really belting tune  feel something missing 
1,why n t people buy albums real artists real singers  prefabricated generic posers try listening aislers set  clientele  belle  sebastian  shins not clay aiken  not n sync  not justin  not brittney  i m trying music snob  guy level somebody singing national anthem high school football game  he stays key feeling uniqueness voice  and looks little much like banjo kid  deliverance   know i mean 
2,what clay aiken s amazing vocal abilities unique style  apparently  tone  give barely passable bubble gum pop ballads  laughable lyrics   everything studio make sound generic possible  clay  find new handlers 
3,not bad album overall  i hoping bit  it s hard call make  for example  kelly clarkson s debute featured top pop hits far removed american idol performances d think another fremale star made ranks  first single  a moment like this  nothing like album came year later   i n t first  turned three chart topping hits  in contrast clay s first release n t removed ve heard american idol performances  s major transformation  s clay best  also first single  released months ago   this is the night  much sync rest album  in fact s stronger tracks  hopefully give ideal expect 
4,as fan american idol franchise  i say cd measure clay s voice  i listen kelly clarkson s cd  thankful  i see cd effort put  however  clay kelly separate artists  styles different  clay s voice  soul  performances ai   cd  measure man   i hear feeling put  songs like  invisible     i survived you    measure man  best songs album  clay  words advice  next album  dont follow music company wants  you sing good n t need poppy 
2,i turn bass way turn treble way find glimpse clay s voice  this album much clutter great voice like  i guess i wait corporate excutives get way clay find voice  they must thought music important voice can i get ten bucks back 
5,this guy real deal  i expected cd great clay n t let anyone  he ll around long time  i hope see write collaberate writers future projects i think clay  ruben dealt whatever controversy class respect another  i wish fans would follow suit  the reality situation    at point  came first really n t matter 
5,clay new age frank sinatra  i listened nothing else since i got cd clay amazing singer appeals many different age groups  in home alone   people     i n t favorite song showcase clay s talent  this album well worth money 
3,i little disappointed i listened cd  it n t even sound like clay  it sounds almost over produced  thing  i think music overpowers voice  however  i advice reviewers listen  my favorite track  measure man   
2,well many people made point  this album rushed  clay s voice fine  album takes chances  word s  boring  it vanilla vanilla  clay producers need remember got here clay soft easy crooner  what remeber clay    the song   do n t let sun go   face clay  re next barry manilow   s wrong  barry still touring records still selling  so clay  time  find good composer like josh grobin sing best  n t sing teenagers know friend   re past 
3,if re looking powerful  astonishing voice heard american idol cd  keep looking  the pipes evident run show  frankly  made us fall love first place  appear sporadically album mostly forgettable fluff clay better  deserves better  
5,wow    great album   i love listening cd  thank much clay  love all songs  hard pick favorite  i try  i really love measure man  the way  i will carry you  perfect day  touch  when you say you love me  run to me  no more sad songs course this is the night    great job sweetie   clay making christmas shopping easy year    my goodness  i buying cd       stars    
4,i received cd gift christmas i admit i pleasantly surprised good recording enjoyable listen  if i received  measure man  present  i admit i likely  would bought  only gained knowledge clay constant media barrage  american idol  frenzy seen final episode contest  i really heard much singer cd  i admit i impressed clay  idol  finale   yes  clearly deserved win ruben  although seemingly nice fellow  sings tune    measure man  solid collection pop rock nice showcase clay s pleasant tenor  his voice  though bit generic  shows good stylistic touches really help elevate quality material a good job clay aiken around listenable cd 
5,this album must own people role model look admire  his personal views emotional convictions heard throughout album  clay s strong  powerful voice combined wonderfully worded lyrics make project essential every music collection  most every person find song suit musical tastes album  up tempo songs like  invisible    i will carry you  start album right   measure man    run me  really thought provoking amazingly real  and s song great  whole album awesome  i n t get tired listening song  there always something new exciting i discover time i listen album  i n t wait see amazing music clay introduces world  until time  i m going listen clay aiken cd 
5,clay aiken talented singers  not voice heaven around nice guy  what i love guy s afraid  he n t follow fads raunchy behavior music industry used  clay unique  refreshing joy listen  i fan forever    i absolutely love voice  music course 
3,sweet little clay aiken  well ok  little  older  everyone loves  s popular idol ever  he sing alright  and hold decent tune  but voice          ahem   well tends get little squeaky times  do n t throw rotten tomatoes yet aiken fans  basically  voice n t anything rave  solitaire good yes i know  powerful voice would justice  i feel cd getting raves mainly everyone finds clay adorable  the n t realise  least claims n t  adorable  american public love  and oh girls love guy big heart n t  he helps disabled kids so typical pop ballad cd  purchase ve fallen spell aiken  pass n t  it n t great loss 
2,only clay maniacs like  it simply horrible  i give two stars  generous  i like clay i think sing  the material bad  did make sing poorly written songs  if bought single bridge over troubled water  bought best clay  i sorry  
1,why would lucid human waste money buying junk  this isnt music  this contrived manufactured  i n t watch american idol never would s awful t v show degenarates everything good music  the only people buy clueless teenaged girls know zilch music  middle aged woman buy kids torture   way sappy  way bland  this safe music people afraid listen music takes risks challenges intellectually  clay aiken stop covering songs the beatles simon garfunkel  he s destroying classics  broadwayesque  voice  the beatles actual artists took risks music innovative  clay nothing like  just another talentless popstar getting minutes fame fade away oblivion  the sooner better   
2,i never watched american idol season  season    i saw clay aiken  do n t let sun go down me  season finale  i captivated  he seemed aloof yet sexy  i wanted find i decided go back album  i disappointed find single song recorded conveys personality i saw onstage  mystery  where charm  where feeling  these songs nothing better manufactured  assembly line pop drivel even little i ve seen clay aiken  i know better guess i ll get  idol  fix original music taylor hicks recorded  hear finely crafted  well written  beautifully understated album along lines clay should done  check taylor s  under radar   it simply amazing 
2,clay aiken freed american idol contract gets real music the cool songs album this night  no more sad songs  i will carry you  for part though  album mixture bubblegum pop broadway    never mixed everyone knows clay aiken n t pop star teen idol  i n t believe real fans either 
1,ummm  sounds good setbacks  the first song sounds good listening words sound awful  like someone else said sounds like stocking girl  his voice warbles sometimes stuff 
2,i like clay bought cd  save money download songs show  much better  he good cd bad  what happened  just rush get  you talent  pick better songs next time 
1,this style broadway  the songs blend   he last making type songs 
1,ewww last night billboard awards  clay gross eye flutter thing  ick  i bet pretty sad beyonce beat female artist of the year  this cd horrible ruben s  american idol stinks  listen foo fighters instead  much happier 
3,i eagerly awaited release measure man terribly disappointed  clay remarkable talent  unfortunately misguided cd  the cd showcase clay s amazing vocal range  i hate agree simon  prehaps broadway would bad place great talent i wish luck look forward next release 
4,okay  yes  i m fan clay   i like music  i thought album good  it teen pop album  anyone watched eppisode american idol  knows clay capable much  i believe album lives potential artist  after listening rendition  bridge over troubled waters   album lacks energy  i would like album challened clay  but said  i still like album 
2,i still fan clay aiken beautiful voice  however  song selection  style  made over  voice disappointing  i looking forward hearing smooth sexy voice american idol songs sang  it  whoever decided songs justice clay aiken  maybe next time   sorry clay 
2,know invisible song  strikes stalker lol n t really song sing know message behind song   lol scary    fan american idol show luv hear cheap cheap hilarious people go show like william hung   lol now that kills me really clay aiken dont know say invisible song really makes think twice
1,clay aiken  i sick people saying clay aiken  real american idol   if i remember correctly  he lost  did hear people  he lost ruben studdard votes  i personally like clay  i think extremely talented  seems genuinely nice guy  however  album horrible  it s slow  bland  boring  all songs sound  lyrics  invisible  bit disturbing  i hope next outing better material  deserves better stuff  if hear american idol s best  go pick  free yourself  fantasia  she s best idol 
2,  invisible  definitely creepiest song i heard radio recent memory  the lyrics seem describe stalker  tell n t weirded hear   if i invisible i could watch room if i invisible i d make tonight    i keep tracing steps each move make   there definitely hidden messages running background song  quick  hide children  i n t heard songs record  i heard many  radio  watching aiken s performance snl  etc    i deduce yet another generic pop compilation churned bloated record machine american idol  clay great voice  though  refreshing change today s pop lyrically musically  i give cd  clay s voice brings    unfortunately accepted rating 
2,no doubt  clay incredible gift  and i ll admit single  invisible  nice change top radio  however  would better served broadway 
2,i dont like music maybe like probably really think music sounds well bands trash listen years never listen  i dont know dont cd i m going get i like things original
3,okay  i know many clay fans disappointed review  goal helpful write honest assessment i love clay s voice  style music cd n t showcase voice i love  there much straining much boy band sound album  my guess teeny boppers group may enjoy us mothers grandmothers big clay fans in addition  disappointing background music over powered clay s voice many selections  i wondered producers thinking  this voice hear  cover up my cd found good home someone appreciate i  i much looking forward clay s next cd  selection songs made  i truly hope songs showcase beautiful voice  arrangements obscure 
4,this great album young artists first  you hum sway music  clay wonderful voice  showcased  better pop rock songs  i know mature next album include songs feature voice like rendition bridge over troubled waters 
3,as first albums cd s go artist jumped churning flood trying swim air  although may best far worst  clay aiken amazing voice  period  as grows business choice songs  he way get better clay sky s limit 
5,this awesome album   way go clay   we waited months album learning words singing right along clay   ca n t wait see concert  hear songs amazing young  he thrills ages what amazing ambassador have clay our american idol canada well please concert tour
5,this cd great  voice infactuating  i bought cd immediately bought entire family  i recommend cd anyone  wants good happy music  who would thought  fan death metal  glitch  trip hop would listend clay aiken cd  liked it of course m lying though 
2,i gave cd  stars i generous  clay alot things thankful  mainly vicious hatred ruben translates super stardom  just today runner sandwich named local restaurant  if clay young artist starting none controversy  way cd would gone double platinum  i like single invisible  good enough carry entire cd  he needs depth voice learn scream every song  these songs collection mushy love songs blending other i wonder feels knowing talent sent career sky rocketing  generous case affirmative action  anyway get richer continue hate 
3,a good  solid pop album  predictable  fluffy songs  should sell million great hits  not i expected though  no more sad songs  perfect day  the way outstanding preferences  touch throw away i could ve done without  i wish bridge over troubled water included perfect rendtions dont let the sun go down on me solitaire show  overall though  i enjoy listen i look forward becoming future cds showcasing true self satisfying  but still worth owning listening 
3,i loved this night  bridge over trouble water  i say i hoping clay  rca would risks new album  if like adult contemporary  album right alley  at times  i find confusing song i m listening  sound similar  would i recommend album  just artist s fantastic voice  shear talent  yes  i would recommend  would i pay   no  wait 
3,this kid voice style  needed better mix songs lighter hand production debut album  too often  compete accompaniment  unfair voice special clay aiken s  he needed little variety songs  i d keep invisible  i survived  this night title track mix little  perhaps covers  still  bad first effort  solid b  i d say  i think world hear clay aiken  btw  maybe n t dismiss broadway readily  it s bad training ground 
3,i love clay dont think cd best could  he gets a minus voice songs get c  surely could written better songs sing  i think tried  pop  much  he would better neil sedaka producing  bad go entertainment  he sound fabulous christmas cd  sounds like clay blown away competition  unfortunatley songs selected cd dont show unique voice like 
3,i love clay s big  powerful voice  unfortunately  i get hear album  material weak i bought album i enjoyed clay s work american idol  i particular purchasing next album  checking songs i buy  give something packs punch  unchained melody  please 
2,wow  album huge disappointment  this sound like clay fell love american idol  he sounds like half rate boy george   the production awful  sounds backed karaoke tracks   where soaring  clear beautiful voice know  shame charge letting cd released condition it seems hype put show  forgotten time comes record album  welcome real world clay  i hope next album supports wonderful talent 
1,unless like syrupy power ballads sound  i would save money  mr aiken overrated over hyped 
1,here guy exceptional voice  what singing boring  emotionless music could sung countless talent others bmg label  i hope guys bmg rent david foster help clay get right next time  clay could good michael buble gosh groban someone could bring incredbile voice 
4,clay s voice soars new territory cd  particularly songs like  touch    run me    invisible   could otherwise categorized ho hum pop music  clay n t singing  the lyrics little corny  clay makes sound sincere  the vocal range songs great  thus n t properly show clay s unique tenor to die for voice i wish  experts  molded songs would kept involvement project minimum  left songs pure  instead processing pop synthesizer sounds  i hear modern day pop album  special  on hand  i hear clay s voice cd s  and true voice great enough n t crowded synthesizer warble 
1,i think measure a man cd best cd s i ever purchased terms versility enjoyment  it great break songs  couple light christian flare  total melt songs devotion sultry  sensual ballad keep hitting repeat    that would track      enjoy  i love    
1,this album good  it s voice i heard american idol  voice cd even good enough broadway  the power exhibited american idol lost cd  i m sorry folks  call cd n t clay aiken  the attempt turn pop king taken away beautiful voice  bring it back forget pop  billboard may said pop album year forgot say took voice away make pop 
1,i love clay aiken death  i really disappointed cd   i really feel commercial  i love voice  curled toes  i saw american idol  he ruben picks  i sad clay n t win  i liked  bridge over troubled waters  cd single  i n t like  i n t pre order   i ll wait hear clips 
2,ok  click button says review helpful  hear  i like clay  i rooting every single week american idol  and cd really n t bad  but n t good either  i clay fanatic say s wonderful perfect technically s really nothing  every song sounds exactly  as i listened album i grew extremely bored i felt like i listening looooooooong song  clay great listen doses song song melodies detached emotionless voice gets dull  and i hate voice songs  you easily tell ran vocals computer  he great voice  they leave alone  maybe future control career  career  things way the weakest song album  measure man   that s pure dribble 
1,this best  good try first cd  but  i somewhat dissapointed selection songs well vocal arrangements  the vocals could lot stronger coming talented singer  clay  i think lot people buying cd making lot hype glad see someone fit mold make big  i m sorry  i agree critics   he stick show tunes   
1,  clay amazing voice   clear strong  honestly  i n t like songs style  it s n t sing  i guess n t sing music i like hear  i given cd gift      i n t know  it gift secret pal i guess whoever pulled beginning year n t know well  if like clay s kind music  ll love cd sings well  me  i guess i m typical r  b fan  love ruben s cd   love tamyra s cd   love kelly clarkson s cd   could n t get  nothing personal  i probably never listened  my bad 
4,i admit i bought album wanting love i loved clay aiken much show  i loved voice seems like kind good person  and though i n t go far say s best album along years  i enjoy  i especially enjoy  measure man     the way    when you say you love me   i little disappointed n t sound exactly like clay i heard show  it voice made buy cd  however  sound great  i would definitely consider album worth listen 
4,i great fan clay aiken  reason i like unusual voice sound  i n t think album showcases style sound way could  he needs get orginial sounding songs stay away backstreet boys trendy pop stuff  he s good  good job  clay  but much better  think elvis costello lyle lovett  two orginal singers real staying power  not poppy real music   invisible  hit n t keep around years 
4,before i bought cd  i already knew clay amazing voice  wow  beautiful ballads  especially  measure man     invisible  great first single got lot radio tv play  no offense ruben  clay s single much popular  i think winner  good job  clay 
5,even though clay runner american idol  proved talent ability great album  if like pop adult contemporary music  album something  the album starts great songs  invisible     i will carry you    the way   latter two singles sure  the country pop  when you say you love me  leads almost intense  no more sad song   then comes beautiful  run to me  inspirational  shine   this followed great  i survived you  clay s  single  this is the night   then comes trio simply wonderful tunes  glorious  perfect day   passionate  measure man   sensual  touch   clay s voice remarkable every song  truly something pop fans  billboard n t best pop album nothing 
5,clay wonderful  unique voice singers  it hard believe beautiful comes tall skinny dude 
4,like everybody else  i rushed buy clay s album  it took listening twice start catching songs  like others  i wish couple songs i known  there couple though  i think hits  congrats clay  i look forward next album 
4,refreshingly different today s mainstream pop music  clay beautiful voice  gets washed sometimes overproduction background music vocals  i would love hear clay complete version  to love somebody  like sang ai  although  invisible    measure man  getting airtime tv radio  cd songs i think much better  try tracks    
1,sorry  album probably worst i ve heard year  it s bland s impossible distinguish cliched  tune free track next  the cynicism simon fuller whole american idol team exposed  knew clay s first album would go multi platinum however useless  made effort whatever they clearly interest developing clay long term artist  if  d given good material people would back second time  here uk  first pop idol winner will young massive success second album  part first actually good  public duped buying half baked cd like n t worth plastic s packaged  it interesting see clay next  i  i d start writing songs  whatever talent  could n t worse ones measure man  
1,bought bit disappointed  i thinkthat clay stick style andstop trying someone s  the songsjust n t me certainly clay aiken sold platinumwith first cd  wonder happened        spend money something worth  butif got  burn acopy clay fanatic sure havea extras hand

3,being clay aiken fan  i bought cd anticipation  while i n t happy first song radio  invisible   considering new stalking song milenia  i hoped rest cd would chance clay show us show stopping voice  charming manner  hair raising emotional performance style it wasn t the song i wanted album  opinion  best song clay performs   solitaire  available  need buy single get it save money clay s next album 
1,i waited long time cd i really looking forward buying  i m young kid  age  think beautiful voice  however  i disappointed  measure   i hoping would songs  idol  least popular songs i least heard  i still think beautiful voice along long time  i ll tell  i buy next cd  i ll sure make sure look selections songs i buy   i think pick songs next time instead letting people    
1,clay amazing voice  i voted ai  album n t makes justice  yeah songs  well meanning thats great beat flow album way slow  i love ballads slow stuff fast stuff  kind pop music trying contemporary  true sing true artist amazing beautiful voice  album  maybe invisible  i think s kinda makes jsutice rest  sorry clay i m sure ll make huge ur next album

3,this album okay  it s would add collection classics s bad 
5,no matter many times listen cd astonished strength purity s talent all emotions  displayed style class 
4,finally male vocalist comes pure pop album send heaven  there weak songs stops giving  stars  but gems  when you say you love me   great album wishing sucess 
1,might start rapping next cd chances might hear  ruben pharrell joint together anyway clay s okay singer ruben better bad got rid frenchie davis quote funkadelic girl bad 
5,i pity the fools that bought this album   do n t want to hear no more clay aiken   if i hear the song invisible  one more time   i am going to go to la  and find that little toothpick white boy and break him in half   uggg   don  t be making no more records clay   i pity you if you do  
1,i know good music i hear debut clay aiken n t good music  additionally  i read reviews someone believes clay receiving star ratings christian beliefs  hello  pop album i idea christian i think people reviewing would n t associate pop christian  if case  n t mr aiken singing lord instead pop music  looks like mr aiken sellout  i purchased album based ai performance  star reviews let  i feel totally defrauded false hype going  most five star reviews false  n t believe ll turned sucker i

3,i thought clay aiken diamond rough american idol  enormous talent brought songs album  i liked songs whole found interest waning listening  he capable much  s promoters hurry market n t see whole picture type songs involved  i think would sound lot better singing style old standards teeny bopper tunes  hopefully start long career  much offer talent  i wish neil sedaka offered ai produce first cd taken  song writers cd mediocre best 
5,clay aiken s debut album absolutely incredible  every song good  invisble  i will carry you  measure man  songs wonderful  his voice much range  the songs ones listen  buy cd  disappointed  clay aiken refreshing sound around long time 
5,i agree songs n t groundbreaking and still great  clay sounds fantastic everything i n t begin pick favorite  shine perfect day remind little crowded house days  the way would perfect slow song high school dance  swoon   measure man depth feeling  when you say you love me fun pop country sound beat makes feel happy  would love hear rumors clay faith hill duet true   i survived you wonderful  each song gets better every listen   i really glad n t try saddle clay bunch oldies  maybe someday   i look forward next cd hope clay continues add  edge  little  funk  without compromising values  until  i listen cd wears eagerly await solo tour

5,love band  alway s will  seen dozen times  continue along teenage son  rather see old school metal band rapper old night 
3,there many books struts days difficult find good  i tend learn best example  i found book useful  i think could improved two ways  examples cohesive   authors resort proprietary toolkit presentation 
2,the first part book started pretty good  i able understand simple login application  after  made feel pretty stupid  i completely lost focus due lack examples ever compounding lecture tough topics  when came final artimus application  basically huge conglomeration every possible thing  i completely lost could n t get working wsad  i gave  m getting different book 
1,listen reviews  this book encyclopedia waste  at least encyclopedia pictures examples  book neither  after first  chapters  s downhill  it frustrating read absolutely examples  it s theory  do n t waste money n t listen fancy quotes book s back cover  this book n t cut 
2,a book author struts  possibly go wrong  this book shows  the book flow  seems scattered topics piled eachother  and  grand finale   learned  applied real world type thing   by time got  i got annoyed i anymore  the examples rely much non standard struts stuff  i trouble title even 
2,i purchased read alot programming books  far worst prepared books i seen  the author drags developement simple login system   chapters  thank god provided code web server  give complete code listings certain classes  leaves reader piece together classes  after chapter  i put went back orielly series i actual learned something  the book information put repetive approach fragmented code  please re think re write  not book first time strut user 
1,book incomplete full errors  even simple errors tostring code used properly throws error  left       and supposed learn someone use tostring  the code web site compile book instructions  do not waste your money  matter paid reviewers say  this worst written book  code fragments full listing code  the site provides code compile correctly vague insrtuctions going actual work  stick o reilly series  please ted husted  find another profession     i picked star zero otpion 
3,this book good introduction struts  it explains well architecture concept  the problem explain details well examples wrong  especailly looking version info  i think book put together hurry  it better documentation apache s website still far away  star book    if new struts  still spend lot time figure details  also programming jakarta struts  book o reilly disappointing i wish author could spend time details gave accurate complete examples pieces 
3,struts great framework  shortage good documentation  this book written nice style  far many errors give good rating 
2,not impressed authors  writing style  points really puts  not good use wordings language  you feel lot especially active reader read good material good sources 
1,if i rate book  i would rate star  this complte waste money i would suggest do n t waste money  if really buy book struts  go o reilley  apart numberous errors  book n t cover anything new basic worth reading 
3,i much enjoyed first eight chapters book first four meat struts  the remainder  however  seemed bit disjointed haphazardly put together  my biggest criticism book pages errata available on line errata  i would expected polished tome detail length 
2,this book woefully date respect struts extension packages author created published  most deprecated standard struts components available replace  i made mistake developing code struts  using book reference rewriting application result  there probably time book made sense may value historical reference  particularly author s extensions  but good reason book struts reference 
1,i ve read i n t understand anything  struts html tags glossed without examples  just  lines use tags object bean refers left imagination  if understand javadoc comes struts clear n t need book  the o reilly book times better serves right buying book without browsing relying reviews

4,i would consider  radio  damn yankees fan  heard radio hits like   do n t tread me      high enough   after hearing essentials cd though  i see s meet s ear  the song i n t seem get   come again   others real rockers  from milder   silent broken   fast heavy   piledriver   cd never stops  the guitars  vocals  bass  drums  rock  i tend give conservative ratings  s i gave   stars  otherwise  i would highly recommend  radio  fans like 
1,this book total waste time money  i read english classth grade plain stupid  trust alot books much better  this worst book i read years  it unrealistic  beowulf defeating monster grendel  already killed hundreds  using sword hands    how naive stupid  besides i think i heard story like hundred times  trust  n t waste time  monwy book 
2,in many ways  beowulf lot fun kids  the writing direct clear  although plenty vocabulary stretchers   the action fun  beowulf s heroism unquestionable but  i n t understand would publish beowulf retelling stay close enough original confusing  opposed john gardner s wonderful grendel  told story monster s perspective   the disturbing divergence making unferth petty bad guy enamored evil  in  nye sacrifices much nobility original i n t know kid friendly tellings story  but  i would look  first 
1,this version  beowulf  not compared   original text  beowulf   students taught this story  re created robert nye  reflective  beowulf  written ad  the story developed shared hundreds years characterized christian concepts ideals  this version  written robert nye  reflects societies overwhelming desire rewrite history  de christianizing go along  robert nye replaced christian god original  beowulf  mythological viking god  odin   the original  beowulf  supports historical significance christian beliefs ideas overall society england throughout europe  robert nye done great injustice adjusting historical document reflect convictions  lack thereof 
4,i used book sixth grade class explore theme ancient heroes  nye s retelling kept class totally entranced beowulf adventures  although follow original introduce young students hero  students enthralled read versions  when nye s retelling compared orginal opens discussions   even sixth graders  
4,as english teacher  i like reading abridged  translated  versions books  however  robert nye capture essence story way holds students  attention  furthermore  version allows engage students occasional excerpts unabridged text  thus allowing meaningful experiences critical analysis 
3,i ordered two copies book i thought i would read year old  she finished less hour  needless say  i n t read  she wanted detail  i going buy hearney  i think spell  translation  i think better fit 
3,i believe book could classified stories glad took time read finish  getting final stage completion task may seem surprisingly  short stories  pages  i ever read  seemed droan good half time  never less  profound moments story i felt i given truly great moments literature  my qualm needed half  cut fair pgs  reader would loose much interest  do remember though  pages long  monotonous scripts 
4,prince songs like  sister     sexuality     delirious    horny toad  anything else similar sounds dez  dez n t write music touched prince  never sound dirty mind album  but use dez left the modernnaires  let s go crazy   dez longer wild  chinese bandana wearing  axeman  he s still axeman  born again  songs  heartfelt lyrics make think like  like a merry go round  talks ups downs life brings us   peacehopejoy  maybe heaviest song cd disc mellow great guitar work at album  behind  real to me  gives thanks fans jesus christ asks along  the cd bore  musically  lyrically spiritually  dez would tell  s  the way i feel   dez i feel 
1,i really wanted like cd  i even bought retail support dez    s rather unlistenable  flat  unmemorable  rote  why finally release amazing modernaire track purple rain  after hearing song back  i waited patiently dez solo cd   waited waited waited   n t

4,the strengths book tips getting trouble  the interesting part book interviews major players history mac  gives chance people voice opinion state mac 
2,i admit  outset  i mac person  i pc tech trying service mac s i probably work year  i copy mac bible  it huge  that s bad useful  the problem i finding i need i wade barrels verbage useless  i finally resort scouring web find answers  i guess i m used direct  almost cookbook approach troubleshooting setup  to fair  thats i gave book two stars instead  i realize different chapters written different authors  content style vary  unfortunately sections i needed written authors i would rather consult future 
5,i taught computer classes high school every sort mac se imac room  this book helped every computer  every problem  stopped many classroom disasters  the format easy  index complete  never need another book mac  the fact concisely even humorously written bonus 
4,there s something lovely young ladies ai yori aoshi tugs heart strings  each distinctive personality  much basically graphic representations literary archetypes themselves the eighth volume series pretty much readers expect kaoru s possible love interests  several stories revolve around chika chan s innocent infatuation  talent extremely cute  chibi plushies  eventual move mansion  there chapters dealing aoi kaoru exclusively  it especially touching see subtly introduce aoi mother scene played well grand romantic series  maison ikkoku comes mind  all  volume eight pleases various aspects encompasses  cuteness  fanservice  romance  drama  comedy  etc

5,these bags hold much debris i still n t replace original since i bought vacuum  months ago 
5,i album vinyl first released regretted loss years   i ve searching online could find available    i finally found someone selling reasonable price i got it   this far important musical purchases i ve made years  this cd astounding   chaka best

5,barbara mason underated singer  i never heard purchased cd chance really surprised material wasnt recognized since im always music  song really stands bed board sang depth  splendid song futures got really puts mood good old soul music 
3,i m fledgling triumvirat fan turned  spartacus   after hearing useless crys triumvirat elp clones  i get  spartacus   the triumvirat seduction complete  just prog i looking for flash forward couple weeks local indie store i found  a la carte  assuming prog vein  oh  wrong i  i ready snap disc half feel good supertramp meets elton john assaulted ears  as i stepped away came back   a la carte  started grow  after   spartacus  plent groovy catchy moments n t much streatch now  digging week   a la carte  ok though n t  spartacus  even  pompeii   s good pop post prog album s right 
3,i issue seller  i read clearly  this one pound ankle weight  i could even lift box  the sellers great gave refund upon return 
3,i   weigh  these weights definitely seem like d bit better fit larger  i n t get tight enough around legs n t slip little that said i still use 
4,brilliant blend dazzling melodies  sometimes vein early split enz mostly s pop  sometimes bubblegum  tony carbone  fella   i wan meet  puts together cuts cute impressive youd like see bikeride get break  fave cuts       but grand  synths find place throughout album giving modern  almost avant garde feel  fusing nicest things pop nice jams  granted  must sophisticated musically apppreciate this jealousy hangs   dave cass
1,i tested product  different cats  i guess aroma appealed tried eat  able the pieces large  i think hard well 
4,a legendary rock n  roll performer  a lot songs covered plagiarized  this dirty rock n  roll little jazzy feel  the collection featuring songs recorded  some songs issued first time   my new pink suedes     rock n  roll school       
4,clapton said the band s  music big pink    changed life     no reason cry  may clapton best  like the band  i   ll probably enjoy compact disc many songs sound like could the band  except clapton s voice  robbie robertson  rick danko richard manuel play backup clapton  members the band wrote two tracks   beautiful thing    all our past times   danko shares lead vocals clapton  all our past times   there two outstanding tracks cd   hello old friend    black summer rain     black summer rain  evokes the band s  it makes no difference  sound lyrics     sun n t shine anymore  rain falls      listen two songs another ll see i mean this album n t clapton s greatest   s still good well worth experiencing 
3,  no reason cry  eric clapton s lesser orginial studio albums  the problem material  simply incredibly high standards claptons masterpieces  ocean blvd     slowhand   that s say album awful  in fact  hardly bad song mix  it n t live expectations  for example  clapton bob dylan collaboration song  sign language  pleasant enough  masterpiece would expect two music giants overall   no reason cry  primarily interest clapton s ardent fans  casual listeners start two albums listed anthology albums instead 
3,i m git player years love ec  this release comeback trail much get happy  reports circulated time recording sessions found ec drinking hard surrounded type musicans involved  ex herion addicts usually go alcohol relieve junk pain herion  it reason release fell deaf ears first issued  ec s playing stiff mediocre  even bonus track added cd  last night  leave filled justice  he stiff git work album  a shame  maybe i m critical  others felt way  judging cover ec bar bottles liquor front answers downer gaps 
5,this album collaborative work bob dylan eric clapton  but dylan liked play music get  slow hand forever day refining refining refining  so dylan  frustrated  laid  sign language  walked away project  that song happens best track otherwise not too shabby effort right  question always beg asked   might  for reason work never recognized intrinsic qualities  respects represents best various eric clapton personae  dylan  course  dylan  good stuff 
4,i think album cd under rated project eric clapton  it fine bunch tunes various styles sounds much like fine material  slowhand   
5,clapton many great albums  no reason to cry exception  every song album great  buy 
1,this novel huge disappointment  the idea  mostly latino women coming together discuss vicissitudes life  original  novel sputters along  part problem dialogue reduced idle chatter narrator remains aloof  i dare say  boring  the reader never gets sense advice latino women influences life deep way  the writing   disappointment  flat uninspired 
2,i soooo looking forward reading book n t  i intrigued meetings women various generations spanish  food  theme  right mix  i thought  it dragged never made feel involved characters   
3,the sunday tertulia easy read  the story line easy follow quite enjoyable  the book consist pages i read hours  only problem i book took little long deliver  i complains 
3,for years i guys  it since graduating college joining  real world  i ve developed girlfriends  this book made think girls  night meetings coffee wine  times i need treasure i expecting novel  details characters  lives  the chapters  instead  brief statement characters  current lives reactions tertulia attendants  i feel like wisdom truth women s thoughts  one thing i especially like author made sure provide translations spanish comments proverbs 
3,i found book tedious  i shocked see  stars reviews  overhyped 
2,it n t hit spot  i found whole religious thing irrelevant  the exoctic mystical eastern religious fascination came across dated  bit hippys thing  and  i really motivated suspend disbelief  it seemed like magic rather science  therefore bit silly  if story characters resonated  maybe i would liked battles action  came across bit bruce willis esque i like line  fit hit shan   though 
1,i m afraid i must agree comments tedious   apart wonderful idea theme novel  eastern religion meets western technology  enough character plot development sustain interest past half way mark  this book praised influence great authors  i must assume theme narrative caught fancy  the narative reads like poor translation  really bad style  a funny moments   overall  dissapointing book considering s high falutin  reputation  i ll stick huxley  i seek enlightenment 
5,i read roughly book week  this favourites  i ve re read enough two copies fall apart  it s challenging read  great 
5,this clearly greatest sf novels time  novice reader science fiction put reading familiar genre  zelazny master special joys sf  joy figuring going   note first amber novel  narrator amnesia right figuring going     at first glance lord light might seem religious mish mash  fact techno politico masterpiece  really wild technolgy unfamiliar politics    combined order chapters  easy see someone read much science ficture could find book incomprehensible  but give great enjoyment experienced reader   re reader  
5,this great book  long complex book  it fast read  it would help knew something hindu buddhist beliefs  i suspicious first author would write write write book without finishing  know i mean  i hate writer  rest assured roger zelazny finishes starts  if proof  read book this immortal  it  great book way easier read lord light  zelazny fantastic writer  the images creates might nothing short spectacular  when book written motion picture special effects task  now though   lord rings  i wonder  
3,zelazny wonderful authors like give wink nudge right middle science fiction musings  a version comedian saying   stay folks   if read last word chapter  realize rest book flashback  come prepared  it would hurt read hindu religion  mythology  philosophy  since roger assumes every body knows subjects  also  explanation characters got ridiculous situation  way seriously  zelazny s work worth read  especially breezy writing style  n b  this book received hugo award best novel  something i agree  obscure  background  assumption western reader knows much hinduism 
5,i read novel couple years first published  probably half dozen times since  this story works many levels  making enjoyable wide audience  its works adventure novel  mythological fable  hard sci fi sharp edge social conscience  the characters well developed throughout story  late plot line really begin understand true motivations  and start finish  s enough mystery  intrigue  action satisfy anyone  in  story works parable illustrating greed  lust power common human nature history  it shows well  true motivation  heroes  seldom appears surface  so  whether enjoy lord light fantasy  adventurous escape reality  hard sci fi  social commentary human weaknesses  excesses  strengths  enjoy certainly 
5,i ve read science fiction since third grade  i ve read alot  i early forties recently reread lord light  it still favorite book  it thought provoking  full colorful characters  often case zelazny s books  reluctant hero protagonist  sam buddah  whose primary attribute humanity  ultimately  sam s heroism demonstrated ability convince peer s ties humanity 
3,he influencial musician yes  he lot music yes  and admirable  but n t change fact likely still woman beater  in book tries justify  and s right  i think music great  i n t great  i never respect thought women objects amusment  and obviously still  he may learned something hard earned experiences  enough  i feel sorry woman ever dates marries  tina turner right thing leaving  strength ever 
3,while i appreciate ike s side story  upfrint abuse tina  he writes relationship great tina loved fact cheated constantly  i sided believe tolerant cheating  i doubt ok  he speak much physical abuse  read book  see doesnt believe abusive  he s hiding  doesnt believe wrong  in fact views regular part relationship  doesnt understand women leaving  i actually pity  but honest possible  i believe reading book  lot movie  complete lie 
1,first  ike thing tina always said would  ike turner never admit tina  tina stayed around long promised would never leave like  others   ike took advantage  tina self said cared much  cher even seen going tried convince tina leave  even girls danced tina stage whitnessed happened tina write autobiography promote career  said talk happened public kept asking went  so released autobiography  well come back while ike try deny wants  truth violently abused tina  and considering person ike turner  i would expect less lie make pathetic excusse come back   
1,in sad excuse memoir ike turner tries tries tries convince us good person  wrong  instead comes psychopathic obsessive fool ruined best thing life destroyed relationship wonderful tina  he jumps back forth opinion tina hey cares  we must remember he beat her up like old saying goes  a leopard change spots  quote marlo thomas  friends    cheater always cheater  take  ike

3,   into celtic mythology  certainly tolkien stephen lawhead good author i enjoyed many books  he research knack able  get  cultures the premise book  two oxford graduate students get transported sacred cairn another place  interesting theme lawhead works fairly well  the character development lacking times development character motives unnecessarily slow moments brilliance make book worthwhile   i particularly loved encounter serbian restaurant   however  jrr tolkien  cs lewis  even charles williams nothing fear  lawhead comes nowhere near level  even level robert jordan  read book  enjoy series  n t expect  the lord rings

3,it seemed like pieces book never explained later  there parts kind rambled  others probably enjoyed extra detail i n t regret purchase  n t finishing series 
4,i stumbled upon book work day  finishing i bought entire series add library 
4,i got book free limited time offer kindle  i might little biased  that said  i still think s worth either buying renting library  what s unique largely told first person perspective lewis  american college student studying oxford university uk  lewis  following friend simon  enters world albion styled celtic history mythology  many people opposed book christian themes i would say give try anyway  it s refreshing unique historical fantasy 
2,another series created idea run mill dude discovers alternate world  sudden becomes courageous forgets past  besides  build great magical climax greatly hyped  falls flat  dont buy novel looking next great fantasy read
3,a solid fantasy trilogy  often useful hook placing modern setting  twist becomes great celtic heroes  quite expect  the thing arts grad student nerd   even surprising  not remarkable though  certainly would read  a grad student friend go wild trip  find supposedly extinct prehistoric ox  follow  celtic mythic albion  adapt fast 
2,lawhead  unfortunately  inconsistent writer  sections book trilogy excellent quite enjoyable  however  longer portions awkward tedious  the writer commits number literary sins drag whole  in first book  character professor  he quite flat known  author s mouthpiece    set piece device used conveniently convey information author trouble working otherwise  the professor least couple long monologues reek device although worthwhile sections  i recommend avoid title pick something better 
4,for love celtic fiction  must  at times lawhead suffers mid book doldrums  book exception  however  probably favorite lawhead book  too bad final series horrible ending practically annihilates hard work author put first two books   stars
5,good book well written keeps attention way through excellent discriptive writing 
5,i ve avid fan stephen lawhead s work years  i truly believe song albion triology best work date  our world shadow compared world lawhead creates lewis simon cross otherworld  it s incredibly vivid plot engaging well thought n t help drawn  celtic mythology something different culture world  stephen lawhead master celtic fantasy genre  i n t speak highly enough books  equal magician  the lord the rings  time fantasy classics

1,i mean  good hits i thought i d check dis  well like every bling  bling  pop rapper  rest album n t worth  i mean i hate rappers use nice songs hits make rest album garbage  make sales  i like limit i n t like cd  i n t recomend  just pass  unless r hard sillk fan 
1,i never really big silkk shocker fan  i apllaudnd album charge  game  unfortunately  made man no limit fell  silkk quite simply copycat  there unique track album  the tracks seem copied previous cash money albums  silkk annoys sometimes trying thug occasions preaching nonviolence boy girl collabos  which silkk  the real rappers no lmit c murder  mac  soulja slim  unfortunately c murder mac lock slim longer no limit  you hear slim s new album years later months  he said saw silkk victoria s secret catalogue  p give  he n t survive without mac c murder 
2,silkk might consider playing basketball continues make cd s like  charge  game good  hoorible  the two tight rappers no limit c murder mac locked  i suppose guest artists like trina snoop dogg would make album better  make better n t save  there decent tracks  the track krazy c murder good  track trina cool  the problem  silkk n t rap  maybe soulja slim lead label  p silkk well 
2,after seeing silkk park talking matured since made man  i thought cd would philosophical superior made man  i wrong  cd commercial offers nothing new  master p creativity n t rap    all cd quite average nothing new offer  if really like silkk  get first release the shocker

2,i ordered three books how contact spirit guide  life other side book dreams  the first two terrific  book dreams difficult understand  however  i m trying understand  sylvia great author  keep captivated  i would really like meet learn her m g ebner
2,i disappointed book much relied upon letters written  i would liked imput  maybe i n t understand  i n t know 
3,i disappointed book  really  it s full stories people s dreams i n t really like  i like dream books give subjects meanings  stories people n t really help me  i n t think i d buy  really honest  oh well  i still adore sylvia  
5,if looking guide help understand interpret dreams  book excellent  with knowledge awareness attained book open fruitful experiences dream this book helped solve many dream realm puzzles
1,ms browne seems well meaning describing experiences dreams others  however  books spends time discussing ms browne s views rather focusing interesting information dreams themselves it obvious reading book ms browne lay person  spiritual guide   scientist kind  i would venture guess information provides based opinions conjecture rather hard  sounds facts i disappointed book   dream  getting money back   
5,sylvia talented help dreams  she helped lot people life  suggestive recommending   the discovery dreams a z 
5,the best thing book practical advice provides helping children deal eliminate nightmares  her insights protecting children needless violent images excellent  i n t say strongly enough provides sensible suggestions implemented would benefit generations children 
4,while dream books focus symbolism within dreams  sylvia focuses different types dreams  offering fresh perspective dream analysis  according ms browne  five different types dreams  release  wish  information  prophetic  astral travel  within section  explains category means  provides examples  one last chapters book contains examples various dreams submitted readers  combination two categories while tons books dream symbolism  first book i ve across actually helps categorize dream  since dreams mostly symbolic nature personal  thereby  bit cryptic  able categorize dream first big help deciphering it i strongly recommend book part studies dream analysis  including carl jung s man his symbols 
4,this film is rated  even though amazon description says   definetly r  i bought  thinking mild sex fart jokes  kung pow humor  surprised find many obscenities overt sexual references  i m prude  i d hoped share preteens   no way  it is hilarious  however  n t young kids around  enjoy 
4,resident evil  outbreak file  amazing online games buy  the problem n t ps online n t even bother renting series  mention buying  outbreak two taken seriously consumer online really wants fun  get scared  possibly win scenarios help people  so many things go wrong scenario  leaving people save eachother  rather caring  this series amazing enemies non stop scares waiting experienced  playing midnight weekends  dark  especially gives game life the problem perspective loading pages last long  w e game pass time  definately serious thought buy game online available 
1,i disappointed game  i love resident evil series  sucked  your ai partners intelligent  run around n t listen need  normal mode actually like  hard  mode  you n t really pause game live monsters get anyway  even inventory screen  the online option disabled n t play people anymore it hassle control three people simultaneously  two never listen anyway the good thing scenery surroundings  also i liked zombies could run wanted  instead always dragging around  other  i really like game 
2,the new resident evil outbreak boring  i expected action packed  boy i wrong  every level like  zombies  i rented the game to shoot zombies  not infected animals  my advice  try friends house play demo first 
4,i hesitated ordering file  could n t resist another resident evil game   over s fun game play  it s dumb a i  characters pain deal  most time keeping alive full time job  with friends like needs enemies  however coming home stretch completing game good feeling 
4,oh  real jordan r brown yeah  i m using mom s account just letting know i m huge fan resident evil movies games but  i first played game  good i got it i m even afriad resident evil monsters  i like resident evil outbreak better  things missing file     m sure  overall s good  s missing things parts making sence  yeah agree you the puzzles complicated  i think  underbelly  despert times  puzzles  seems frustrating confusing plus  characters need chapters but  i still think s good game  i still like resident evil outbreak better resident evil best horror games i ever played resident evil rules  
2,so much hoping capcom would learned s lesson first outbreak game  nothing improved chapter  this game still stupid a i  annoying real time window made first game horrible  not mention characters  audio text often times n t correlate  zombies popping random times helped compound frustration levels  probably disappointing lack suspense creepy atmosphere made many resident evil predecessors great 
5,with multiple objectives  game keep coming back play  first  find way  second  search secret items  third  see quickly scenario completed  fourth  first three objectives four difficulty levels some fans may find bit boring resident evil  game classic resident evil feel  also  even easier modes  game challenging  it s impatient easily frustrated i gave five five fun  overall play another  replay value  no resident evil collection complete without game 
3,nothing spectacular  satisfaction dice lasting year without fading without cord breaking giving special  fuzzy dice  feeling car

4,this book gives thorough overview monotype printing  it starts materials needed  goes talk hand transfers  press transfers monotypes acrylic  watercolor  oil printmaking inks  it covers mixed media stencils  masks  etc  it much practical useful information section techniques materials  there examples type work covered  athough i would liked see larger  gallery  work different artist  a good book interested monotypes 
1,i mean   the pictures original version book beautiful   like many childrens  stories  half enjoyment  but   buy original somewhere else  they ve messed otherwise great book 
4,the scenes stories lingered thoughts long i put book  the intriguing aspect contrast cold detached environments characters interact sensuality infuses everything  i enjoy visiting worlds beyond  book took 
4,the scenes stories lingered thoughts long i put book  the intriguing aspect many scenes contrast cold detached environments characters interact sensuality infuses everything  i enjoy visiting worlds beyond  book took

4,i m experiencing classic tennis elbow  much bad technique backhand  playing guy hits ball lot pace deep backhand corner  the elbow support works pretty well  stays place w  velcro strap  only thing i d suggest improvement somewhat larger  higher area pushes forearm muscle tendon  overall  works well 
3,i ordered tennis elbow support well mueller  tennis elbow support  black  one size  amazon  i found  futuro  uncomfortable wear length time  i found edges scratchy  the pad goes affected area somewhat crinkled left marks arm taking  the mueller tennis elbow support much comfortable  i wear hours  it leaves marks indentations   oddly  uncomfortable wear  i try support whenever i give arm time breathe marks go away  massaging area arm  i tend leave i know i m going lifting anything way stressing area at home  sleeping  etc 
5,i like elbow support much  i wearing right day  it comfortable  it hard find right support  i glad i found amazon com  i nerve problem many years wear support every day  if i n t i major pain arm fingers  this support intended 
2,futuro makes another version like compression sleeve extends elbow two forearm pressure points  i find much easier use  this goes fine  slides frequently  if i try pulling sleeve adjusting  slides i try get sleeve back  if might using wearing long sleeves  n t make adjustments throughout day  i recommend checking version says  elbow  sport version 
4,the futuro tennis elbow support good value  the product durable provides good support  one unexpected problem width product  for tennis works well  for lifting carrying things thickness prevents full flexion elbow causes irritation rubbing 
4,though cd live awesome power pangaea agharta still powerful cd  this heavy music powered jazz funk otherworldliness miles davis could create  this heavily influential anyone dj spooky tortoise  as album  dave liebman n t compare sonny fortune saxophonist sound little iffy hey s miles said n t go wrong 
4,this concert recorded long pete cosey joined band material took distinctly funk direction rather jazz rock proceeded on corner album the band comes swinging turnaroundphrase  sounds closer james brown versions i heard  though sound marred minutes bass drums lock around swirling pool funk  the second song i believe  tune  great funk guitar intro miles spacey trumpet  moving towards ife s heart beat bass  brilliant guitar soloing  percussion 
5,honestly  i rely heavily reviews  i must comment  they awesome  i never bought pair boots price comfortable  i love  i typically wear vasque hiking boots montrails  i spend seventy five dollars boots  after  going get muddy trashed  right  these fit bill  plenty good hiking  i comment waterproof capabilities i plan using wet  i n t chance ruining  although  well made boots i highly recommend spend much money hiking boots  save money buy still priced fairly  sixty five dollars   do n t go hundred dollar pairs boots  it simply wasting money  these work well hiking boots i ever worn walking

2,kirk whalum favorites  cd jeopardizes current releases  the recordings sound like performed garage  studio  background instruments sound digitally created like casio keyboard do n t waste money one his release  unconditional  incredible  spend money 
3,while i listen great deal jazz smooth jazz  i find best listening cd stuff leads back gospel roots gospel according jazz cd s follow  this interesting collection left less awe struck reason  i like kirk s ideas melodies  solo work reserved processed   more like would expect musician playing juries master class front peers  college music majors relate kind starchy playing   it accurate lacks depth michael brecker  mark colby dave sanborn  still  i would rather listen cd collection million kenny g albums i glad i  would n t hear rest albums accompany selection best 
5,vendor provide prompt response  fix problem right away  you could n t ask anything 
3,it turns bosch makes vacuums need bags vacuums n t  the bags expensive  makes sense buy vacuum n t require constant  expensive purchase 
3,this brush ship directly amazon  govacuum  nowhere brush bosch  though supposed bosch model  compact plus health guard  i suspect even made bosch  it much darker color pictured much darker attachments  the clip connection supposed used clip canister much difficult use original brush even engages  wand n t steady  the vacuum work though  brush attached important feature

1,this tool attracted first concave shape jaws  my current cable cutter basic straight edge cutter  job well  sometimes cables slip jaw since blades straight  so  curved jaw  i pretty excited  hand tool  my tool arrived today i decided test cable cutter piece shielded    stranded wire  first attempt  epic fail    it cut plastic sheath piece wire strand actually cut  rest  bent point contact what s worse  the blade bottom jaw got chipped  very disappointed tool  generic wire cable cutter job half price  tool looks well designed strong  blade edge way thin fragile  this tool sent back amazon  
2,use two hands  jaws open far enough get wire 
2,these cable cutters worthless  i purchased trim bicycle cable shielding cables  they barely either  trying cut shielding simply folds cable half jams  i tried different holding positions placement shielding cutter  simply different results  they cut cables get placement perfect  they chipped already probably used situations i n t clean cut

1,buy shirts  worth money  certainly worth bill blass label  poor style stitching fabric 
2,though good workmanship  i expecting heavier material brand 
1,i bought two shirts later i realize never ever buy cloths net  what see get  these poor quality shirts 
2,the material almost see through collar stays sown material  not really highest quality although expect price 
3,if i expect bill blass  i ll stick arrow  it thin wrinkles easily

4,n t expecting much first actually top quality standards  first bought make sure size fits bought  many 
2,i bought shirts   thinking i ve got bargain  i received disappointed purchase  as previous reviewers mentioned  material flimsy   cotton   polyester  feel like latter   fit improper finish poor  am wearing shirts  wears uncomfortably  feels like poorly made medical scrub  looks cheap  yes  even french blue color   will either send back collecting dust closet

3,unfortunately   leagues under sea  shows age  while story  actually  quite good  language somewhat stilted book takes really get going  i think many young readers puzzled vocabulary bored  eventually  story picks  however  i bored s imagine today s youngsters much better  i think walt disney movie much better bet expose child story true classic  this cases movie advantage written word 
5,this book amazing book i could put i started reading  if like adventure little bit fictional history love book  in twenty thousand leagues sea lots great adventure scenes  i like jules verne describes everything detail  i would definitely recommend book

1,this book boring  moments book actually exciting far  the beginning book best part  it spent much time explaining describing images  felt like whole book could cut half would still get majority story across readers
1,i never received item  the seller sent item shipping address billing address   different addresses receive mail house 
4,literary classic i glad i read  i wish i read years ago  i go back childhood home see i find book i i child 
3,the descriptions names animals dated  the ideas expressed well  it interesting see technical details held up overall bit dull times rather long descriptions typical books written period  would better bit editing content updating language 
4,i enjoyed book thoroughly never seemed amazed incredible imagination portrayed author eerily accurate know
3,there s world deep ocean see believe  jules verne takes  i got disinterested verne s overt detailed descriptions life  otherwise  fascinated read 
4,a classic classic  additional features edition make great choice  nice illustrations  
2,the hardcover version sterling edition bound printed nicely  jules verne s story enthralling full detail  however  translation sterling edition old rather tongue twisting read aloud  the word ordering sentences often reflects original french bit much  likewise  numereous names various flora fauna rendered latin form  rather common names i m familiar  i ve found frederick paul walter s newer  unabridged  translation much easier read  amazing journeys  journey center earth  from earth moon  circling moon  leagues under seas  around world days 
2,this book started ok  i mean good intro nothing seemed happen  dont get wrong  like two scenes action really short lasted maybee page  and long book huge spaces book nothing happened 
1,do buy book  it waste money  if buy book  somewhere never go use  even read first  pages disgusted 
3,i read book summer reading project  i felt book advanced  by saying advanced  i mean verne modern thinking ideas  book written quite ago  i think s good book everyone read  it s fast read  
5,20 leagues under the sea great book jules verne  it ship gets attacked giant monster  professor aronnay sets steel plated submarine find monster  captain nemo near  agrees go new world  he n t expect monster  though  lots action book  blowing things  great escapes     find rest 
1,this paperback  barnes noble  classics editions  republication original english translation rev  lewis page mercier made  mercier s translation leaves  book makes numerous textual errors  these facts known fifty years  the editor victoria blake  otherwise identified  fact recommends appendix reading might consult complete novel translated walter james miller frederick paul walter published naval institute press  
3,my problem book boring least goes much detail  i m referring endless descriptions water  molluscs  creatures  vegatation   now re sea faring persons  loves loves sailing boating whatever  enjoy book  i enjoy action scenes scenes dialogue interaction nemo professor  there much detail i practically skimmed pages  i feel bad i interest subjects  much point  interesting 
4,only four stars amount skimming i massive quantity scientific nomenclature fish creatures encountered  beyond  book amazing adventure story triumphs dangers make feel atmosphere almost every scene  it makes movie seem mundane 
4,i love jules verne s writing  this book small enough fit purse glove box anywhere  if like steampunk fiction  old west  read jules verne
5,i love book    i gave rating book awesome   also i could imagine book head
4,in book three main characters  ned land  professor aronnax  captain nemo  the book twenty thousand leagues under sea veryinteresting  it suspensful always thinkingthat characters going  their mant differentsurvival scenes  for example scene captain nemo sees anindian gets attacked shark jumps water tackels shark  he almost gets killed ned land throws hisharpoon kills shark this book reminds ocean always traveling ocean submarine  this book exciting always going different adventures  the book makes think i first road sailboat  in beginning book sailing boat 
3,the classic undersea adventure n t disappoint  full mystery  terms unknown element  behavior cagey captain nemo  easily engaged  reader travel beneath  visiting places imagination  seeing phenomena i hope lucky may witnessed 
5,we reading unabridged version kids indespensible aid understanding descriptive story  the pictures great accurate descriptions  historical notes put story context written  i e  marvels electric engine  extant knowledge life  predictions underwater scuba gear   the kids follow along i read text close  i heartily recommend reading aid 
5,the original story lush great vocabulary detailed description  little work  well worth  i m reading aloud     year olds  the dk illustrated abridgement good supplement 
4,it s amazing consider prescient book  descriptions submarine travel  the extensive descriptions oceanic life border  times  tedious  must novel exciting original audience  the main shortcoming book little explanation given captain nemo s background motivation last chapters  even hint shadow explanation given this apparently best english translation  difficult 
2,i really disliked book  i think fact lines sentences throughout book made difficult  this great story  imaginative painful get unless marine biologist 
4,twenty thousand leagues  i found fascinating wonderful piece science fiction  it difficult put
5,sure language changed since written  translated french  but ideas hold great  plot cool  characters entertaining  a great read  entertaining see j v  predicted correctly totally  the introduction pretty cr ppy  it tried make j v  seem like futurist without peer  one example  predicted escape velocity rocket  i believe italian dude figured s want read good classic  this  need discover tried true sci fi original  ditto 
1,the narrator european  french  accent  instead gravely american accent  it fit story  i happy purchase 
3,i think well written novel  jules verne exelent writter  i rated bool  i dont like read worth dont mind plus pages enjoy science fiction go get book 
2,okay  maybe i n t mean  classic   i found book quite insufferable  i suppose s unfair judge modern standards  i anyway  i found policy heroes attempting kill animal possibly could little disturbing  book mentioned dolphins otters thought flashed head  talking stag   not  book s bloody boring  it consists many vague  unfocused  quite unconnected episodes never evoked interest whatsoever  i would finished book i n t reading class  geesh   study question  ned conseil  lovers 
1,this book would good marine biologist latin translator people translate  the book might say something like   the nautilus attacked group spodulini auarius   you confused  a chapters later  might say nautilus attacked giant squid  then everything clicks  the story long winding  seemed like would never  i could n t finish book begun seem torturous  do n t read 
2,i describe much i enjoy book  it took  months read reason i consider  days long time read book  so much description plot made book feel like pages long  it never got anywhere  i cared nothing characters finished i could say i 
2,the book leagues under sea really disapointing book  most story boring exciting  when got interesting good books  i thought going good book  the disapointing part  i would recommend book people age 
2,i read loud three children young  stayed around  mind numbingly dull unless reads funny voice reads sad narrator s unrequited love captain nemo 
3,the story interesting  i found descriptions fish creatures tedious get  i persevered finally finished 
2,i disappointed find children s version jules verne novel  amazon s description n t make clear 
4,20 leagues under sea great classic everyone read give plenty time  it let details soak  details  details  details  there plenty  reader n t quite understand every aspect book reading pick leagues under sea fear  get someone read share exciting wonderful world ocean parts eyes jules verne  no go life never reading wonderful classic jules verne  his descriptive talents absolutely wonderful explain every subject book  i recommend book anyone need adventure mind  enjoy 
2,this book classic  no question  that s i chose read  when cames  science fiction gripped imaginations many  a ship could travel water  but reading  much novelty book realized  we submarines nearly century but even aside  little plot novel  it reads written committee national geographic  it s survey unique items places world s oceans  the little plot involves protagonist trying escape ship  and ending  ruin    total cop out disappointing i hoping book would stand test time  like the time machine even around world days  but i found rather boring drudging read 
4,this jules verne s famous novel  still holds pretty well  it slower  deliberate pace today s readers probably used  still good read  i n t think i need say much  story pretty well known  but i say captain nemo intiguing character  people interested victorian era fiction definitely get book 
3,the begining book  really attracts i read excited thinking rest would interesting  continued i really getting bored  i read last part quited reading  i think s famous verne s fantasy making tha nautilus 
3,unfortunately   leagues under sea  shows age  while story  actually  quite good  language somewhat stilted book takes really get going  i think many young readers puzzled vocabulary bored  eventually  story picks  however  i bored s imagine today s youngsters much better  i think walt disney movie much better bet expose child story true classic  this cases movie advantage written word 
3,it good book  overall  felt like half time overly descriptive made dry  got  done tried finish  back   felt though prof stay part wants leave  half time spend describing things  fish  coordinates  history  descriptive book  get dry times move next page stop reading drawn descriptions
3,so  nearly years passed since book published   much become boring  i m sure back description under sea boats suits work thrilling  s kind   yup  i know that he goes deep detail marine life  many time  i skimmed skimmed skimmed  honestly  book i wanted  it could possibly make  star movie right effects today 
3,when consider mr vernes wrote undersea adventure submarine  steam engines rage  and underwater boat unheard  by todays standards book exciting  time adventerous  the endless cataloging undersea life operation submarine autor s head  there thing note i first read book grammer school re read  it shame considered childrens book  vocabulary worlds high school students understand 
4,confusing title  my husband i talking night jules verne novel under sea admited confused title time  leagues  miles kilometers    thousand times deeper deepest point ocean  leagues distance two traveled nautilus obsession worse nemo  i rememberth grade group boys huge series blue prints nautilus based book  i thought waste time back still apparently lots folks n t  the blue prints nautilus feature clive cussler s book valhalla rising  and s entire website devoted blue printsd models closing thoughts  i much prefer sequel leagues under sea  if get chance  read the mysterious island 
4,jules verne captivating poetic writers ever existence  all novels complete masterpieces  novel best i ever read  its intricate plot line complicated writing style make novel seem romantic adventerous  although writing style may round a bout  i find completely matches story line  the unusual adventure needs writing syle complement exciting subtleness  jules verne  read cover cover n t skip word  every significance 
4,excellent book young adults grownups alike  it difficult imagine book first published i still original copy  annotated walter james miller edition   thomas y crowell company was verne first true science fiction writer world  i m sure  nemo complicated figure  anti colonialist  scientific  engineering genius  expatriate  madman  professor pierre aronnax  conseil  ned land provide foils nemo s adventures  highly recommended 
4,sheer adventure narrative aquatic zoology oceanography nerd  captain nemo prototype mad mankind genius villain  bad yet sympathy deserving actually challenging reading  many science terms 
5,this book good book  i like book beacause buster brain it cool book read it funny book  the end 
2,sony made big marketing mistake unit  it support voice commands  voice tags  voice dialing  handsfree calling  regardless capabilities phone  the only handsfree call make unit last number redial  all calls must placed phone usual  must use call transfer route bluetooth unit  this n t meet legal requirements states countries designed marketed  it s big disappointment  big waste money 
3,i n t really feeling gemini   i generally listen cd s entirety passing judgement  however  i could n t resist urge fast forward next track minute listening n t manage draw music  brian serenades voice effort i felt d  already done   many tracks sounded sampled work  laid new vocals slapped new title voila  mishap  i give gemini three three tracks kept considering effort total flop 
3, s okay  four cd s brian great           ok rvf sedona 
2,this cd lacks effort  only two decent tracks  rest tracks leave lot desired  a real downer 
3,like reviewers stated  i m sure brian mcknight cut anything smooth ballads  like albums  handful nice slow jams  up tempo material really strongsuit  although brian favorite artists  s up tempo tracks  he really trying hard win younger fans  needs realize even younger fans pay attention street cred acceptable material  aside up tempo attempts  brian couple good slow jams  nothing stands ones previous albums  i must say  albums failed get better previous releases  like brian mcknight general  i m sure ll find least couple tracks album burn onto collection 
4,i n t understand people expect brian mcknight s new music sound like old music  if i wanted hear old cds i would pull cd case  every time artist puts cd  way reflects his experiences life  not fans  we thankful talented musican  singer songwriter gives us privilege sharing  i m happy another brian mcknight cd add collection 
2,brian mcknight knows his zodiac sign  month he born  musically he truly suffering idenity loss  somewhere early s early s mcknight swimming  he very talented vocalist  multi instrumentalist  songwriter s quite since he left mark on set he n t make mind he wants be r kelly  ronald isley  prince   others as long brian mcknight been around would think he would n t still trying find his own musical idenity going album truly spinning music circles  direction appears sight  cat alot his career 
1,i ve always loved brian mcknight s music  from  back one    still one    one last cry    anytime    loved  if re hoping anything remotely like  ll wish n t spent money  it s shame i recommend album  n t shine  i sense feels like needs get back  roots  going soulful  slow hip hoppy  and succeeds points  s gon produce top single regular top radio  it sorta reminds later efforts mariah carey whitney houston stopped delivering kinds music fans wanted instead thing  what shame  letdown

2,snl deserves comprehensive overview tells us put together show how why matters mattered  this book  the author simply objectivity n t tell us truth  if read already know show s popular sketches book read  we learn almost nothing personalities worked together not make show last long  far little time spent first  years first amazing cast  but hear pat  victoria jackson book  a real mess 
4,if re interested hearing first hand cast  producers snl  book  definitely long deals everything beginning early s  i found distracting times organization interview snippets certain chapters  definitely worth read re fan snl 
2,did know writers performers worked night tuesdays  or lorne michaels dysfunctional father figure  well ll reminded every fifth page yawner  sure s interesting gossip sniping  save time get cliff notes pages interesting page book 
4,time snl cutting edge tv but days long past  honest plug show pulled least years back but s early days set standards shows like in living color   see  madd tv  among shows i always wondered show african american cast members years  eddie murphy missing something badly me of course would hear eddie murphy reflect show interesting stories john belushi he something else this book deals alot various topics 
2,this book interesting read easy get finished sitting  if looking detailed narrative  book probably 
3,snl absolute classic  ground breaking comedy  innovative  times quite outreageous  s  and  this book brings us stories snl stories snl s cast  writers management  straight horse s mouth   it s fun read  but  book would  like  much less  know  annoying   like  authors actually applied  like  editing utterings mutterings people interviewed book least  like  little bit  you know  reading page page appear verbatim transcriptions interview segments started getting old really quickly  and off putting  especially non california  non us readers  hey  like  wow 
4,i m big fan snl  i quite excited get book  it let  the reading easy  format facilitates transmission information would n t normally know  writers  actors  producers  etc  talking short interview snippets  filled occasionally explanations context authors book  it s great situation  allows memorable moments like will ferrell saying chevy chase worst host ever worked  it s fascinating stuff  i d recommend snl fan 
5,this book must read anyone grew watching saturday night live  even bad years  i really enjoyed reading book gave first hand accounts events  several different points view  the thing struck reading much talent lorne michaels misused years  he nothing  short sighted  i love cast members writers aired dirty laundry  all feuds petty arguments came  what i say  i m sycophantic original cast  several later casts  if fan snl  cast  book 
5,  it s fun book  full fascinating stories  like snl  odds overwhelming ll like live ny  thanks 
3,the number interviews quite astounding  this informative work i believe s probably highly  totally  accurate the format little unusual  they interviewed dozens people printed fragments conversations together  grouping  subject  area  
5,this book may look big size quick read  it mostly old cast members  writers  hosts talking show  it honest look show i ever seen  it sweet  touching  funny  raw  i could n t put  i fascinated people actually knew john belushi talking last days  also adam sandler s dismissile snl  no matter cast favorite behind scenes book give new perspective show 
4,this book  comprised mostly interviews people worked saturday night live years  really works thanks editing  as person tells anecdote  miller  shales follow someone else telling contradicting story  details another source the story spans years show s history  great detail  however  doug hill jeff weingrad s  saturday night  a backstage history saturday night live  better job chronicling earliest days show 
1,when i began read book  i expecting superbly written historical account saturday night live television show  instead got nothing plethora transcribed interviews people associated show when i began reading book  i hoping authors would include listing people graced show regular performers  guest hosts  none information offered apparently takes write best selling book nowadays tape recorder  word processor  book comprised of a court stenographer could written 
3,this book seemed long love letter brilliance lorne  kind putting  there lots great anecdotes  guy early swho grew watching saturday night live early s hard identify stories s early s  additionally  kindle edition probably takes away book  i found go online see pictures people i could identify 
3,purchased gift snl loving spouse  s great bathroom book  short excerpt format  if looking flowing chronology history saturday night  might hard stick  it s broken  voices change every page two  making feel disjointed  because memories someone else s memory event n t always  get amusing perspectives different egomaniacs claiming great ideas  nice background behind the scenes promised  lots dirt sex drugs  expected  not something i would purchased  even though i m fan  compared offerings  really authoritative  closest source  accurate 
4,a legitimate page turner  as fan snl i enjoyed moment  i particularly enjoyed discovering i thought jerks turned likeable   course opposite applies  to say snl  good used  i say much better used  do n t get wrong  i loved originals crystal  guest  short shearer years fabulous  farley murphy gross macdonald sanz meadows ferrell morgan kataan fey fallon dratch great  it big problems course  many hosts whose movie opening week  characters repeated often  whole  s always exciting funny  i wish live from new york  included cast members 
3,i interested book i watched snl years  found shales book dull  slow moving frankly  i n t read mundane contributions  stars   mostly nothing particular  i share adulation belushis talent ego  get better latter half book i rated  stars  probably little high 
2,given reputations involved  especially shales  hellacious disappointment certainly worth hardcover price discount  they could n t even get murphy talk  given saved show  major problem book size alleged scope  o donoghue  viciously brilliant  reduced parody  there s nothing could n t figured reading years tv commentary watching show 
2,i try remain neutral topic  way snl changed years  what dynamo saturday night changed mediocre program  still trying find  given politics hollywood games players  this essentially oral history groundbreaking show early days present  nearly pages interviews writers comedians made show  book includes gossip well tributes deceased cast members likebelushi  farley hartman  a lot crude language anecdotes  i n t know re  maybe someone thought funny  detracts overall book 
2,if took every comment cast  writers producers trying  unsuccessfully  figure lorne michaels  heavy tome would easily cut half  too much whining  little interesting  historical information  long time fan show 
3,the book starts strong great job covering early years  part i suspect readers  seriously bogs moves coverage early s ultimately  could least pages shorter  by time i got pages recollections lorne michaels  i could n t anymore 
2,i agree whoever wrote book way long unorganized  i hoping learn behind scenes works  boy  i  drugs  partying  sexism  racism  s  there great gems among trivia people already know but s quotes different actors  writers producers  there photos break things  nothing else  no cute little sidebars anything  heck  s good enough school textbooks  put  i n t add  got tedious awhile the format makes odd read  you get things like someone rapsodizing  beautiful person  john belushi couple paragraphs someone reminiscing time set stuff fire passed drunken stupor  oh well 
2,tom shales james andrew miller seemingly provided opportunity free therapy sessions former current snl staffers  the whining  moaning venting hard lives laughable snl skits ve ever performed in the book provided nothing interesting show actually operates  sniping another seems reason cast member even agree interviewed book  missed opportunities interviewing lesser cast members  though might turned authors  could painted complete picture the special biography  a  e  interesting book  hour  catch instead 
3,this good book  that said  n t tell lot i n t already know  i surprised find tool chevy chase  book really glossed  mostly  s lot producers  writers network execs giving divergent accounts stuff went right wrong  it s hard tell liars  obviously plenty since many people contradict  quotes actors make minority book the whole idea book  full juicy gossip  wrong imo  it s actually full tv execs talking think everything someone else s fault 
4,i really enjoyed reading book felt like i got insiders look snl  the book allowed everyone say peace give side story  it interesting see dynamics executives  loren  writers actors  i felt like could really form opinion based testimonies people involved  it easy read format little blurbs person involved particular topic cast year  the writers would paragraph help transition topics 
4,if re hardcore snl fan interested learning history show  book  if read happened behind the scenes  sex  drugs   book  i liked way people involved told bulk story  i loved first  book felt like i reading story season next  guy drugs  woman sleeping guy  n t popular cast members   season ended another began  i could n t finish 
4,i loved book  living mid west  re privy rumors stories local paper snl  i loved reading inside stories  the bad thing i could say book put thumbnail pictures quoted  it hard lesser known cast members quoted  trying remember 
2,i insatiable mood lately new progressive rock music buying cds daily basis  i uncovered superb new bands riverside  abigail s ghost  frost  phideaux first two named bands absolutely exceptional  i encouraged reviews try iq album particularly exceptional representative example  i think reviewer said sums  iq managed simple outlasted everyone else  i sorely disappointed album total lack anything original new  musically fine progressive rock original  yes genesis  marillion etc  thing anything like seconds out  overall i found album flat uninspiring   sorry 
3,i enjoy listening wayne dyer  voice soothing  wisdom mixed humor  i relate says  this cd little different  i could n t listen i driving car  the breathing techniques  exercises   little thought provoking strenous  the part cd  listening suggestions healthy living i expected 
5,this amazing  in depth book everyone read  c h mackintosh spirit filled ability travel wonderfully deep word god  i recommend book anyone appreciates closer walk god 
2,the movie captures look feel narnia many scenes beautifully blocked filmed  however  movie s creators tampered much actual story  this flaw     must  copy books exactly  recognize creativity may required retell book s story smashingly good movie  this  failed  the ridiculous attempt love story susan prince embarassing  and turning miraz usurper first acceptor new land totally unnecessary ineffective  news flash  there reason stories stood test time read re read children adults  generation generation  good stories  do n t mess unless s absolutely necessary done effectively 
1,as many others said  unnecessary deviations book horrible  why make new story narnia lewis never told  the character relationship development horrible 
1,  infuriatingly inaccurate    die hard narian fans heed advice n t even waste time movie  for example disney thought ok allow prince caspian kiss queen susan  attention disney  that never happened book    there number inaccurate happenings movie  i waste time list   this movie top ten hated movies time  i refuse buy version  i waste money   
3,there s nothing particularly good bad prince caspian  s all round average piece movie making  i m convinced keep kids entertained  many adults find staving occasional yawn  at least attempts humour injected script  although success decidedly patchy  there pretty good set pieces  not much else say really  except mice extraordinarily large s dwarf bears uncanny resemblance martin amis  yet another film fails source material justice  it really deserves   stars 
4,i huge fan cs lewis narnia chronicles  i read child reread routinely  this second production  prince caspian  took liberties i n t really  general way good  if kids  first try get read books  i n t imagine seeing movies without read  cs lewis author many great christian books  screwtape letters  another great book mr lewis lot humor  along clear issues  side  us older children 
3,i sorry admit i think good first  do n t get wrong  ok  i liked first better  i ll give so so rating  i think story line needed depth 
4,i really enjoyed movie  the sound effects great  it s way intense first  i n t read books  i would really like another movie  i believe really sad ending  all  s good flick  watch today like fantasy 
4,it good movie overall  way predictable seeing first movie  step  i would recomend movie  it worth money 
4,my child loved this me  much  very elaborate well made movies s  i came away little terms lasting impressions 
4,ok  wonderful movie   the two chronicles movies absolute favorite movies   i saw theatre opening weakend  i huge fan  this  disc collectors edition money well spent  it hours behind scenes  like   problem  the dvd came  non padded envelope  whole dvd case cracked broken  i surprised discs harmed   oh well  it worth money  i wish better properly shipped
4,this good watch marathon whole family  one disc  maybe    n t seem work first  but tried let stay player minute started working   a minute long time day age instant gratification  
3,wasnt great loved cgi thats acting wasnt great story well like sitting reading book dull   maybe ok kids kids would playing floor carpet 
4,i got series daughter  loves entire series  i find quite entertaining watched second movie twice since arrived
1,when the lion  witch wardrobe came i n t see  i practically learned read books  remained favorite annual re reads  as turned  i choice see  work  i amazingly pleasantly surprised so i decided see prince caspian  again i surprised  time i surprised disappointment  did follow storyline  a lot noise violence  main impression 
5,i thorougly enjoyed watching chronicles narnia movies  they greatly entertainingd amazing  recommended whole family 
3,our kids liked books narnia  like see watching videos fun  at least see liking watch together group   kids enjoy others company 
3,at beginning  i impressed  there several good scenes written plot  however  duel peter miraz ensuing battle delayed logical highpoint story  aslan  furthermore  aslan  battle ridiculous looking  even fantasy  sequence summoned tree water spirits  all made film least minutes longer degree better 
2,i never read books  i really enjoyed first narnia  movie  seemed like pleasant mix child literature fantasy writing  movie pleasant surprise  part harry potter   part lord rings    this new n t nearly good though  acting seems stilted  story n t interesting  religious overtones much prevalent  i looking forward  n t recommend others
4,the movie good  it close book  i think first movie better 
3,this movie nice even close lion  witch  wardrobe caspian n t charm magic first n t follow book  the acting def  good al i disappointed 
4,with more action violence the chronicles narnia  prince caspian i would say best narnia movies i seen  i wish adventure like first movie about  movie big battle  it n t beat the  lord the rings  trilogy action  creatures  as movie critic prince caspian  i give  possible  stars 
3,if read book dissapointed  they n t follow book well  it n t great  n t horrible  hope next better  
1,this movie absaloutley awful  acting bad  made cringe seat  this example completely recasted  it upsetting decided wanted  lord rings  screenshots battles  i love books  chronicles narnia favorite series  previous adaptation  the lion witch wardrobe  i loved  strayed much far book  the reason four children slipped acting ability first roles serious  i mean  killing human beings without even flinching  susan whips bow shoots trained soldiers horses nonchalance getting bed  i tend hard movies  if terrible unconvincing acting makes vin diesels  fast furious  look like  there will blood    s mildly enjoyable time cinema 
5,as previous film  the chronicles narnia  septalogy   prince caspian  honours original fantasy novel professor c s lewis   high standard acting  cinematography  special effects   course  good screen play  as previous  film grows viewer   seen first time  although impressive endearing  perhaps deeply successful seen repeatedly  allowing viewer better capture many beautiful details missed 
2,not poor followup initial success first narnia films  would dreadfully poor stand alone film  the plot convoluted hard follow  original cast well  additions left memorable trace  the story   felt like n t well fleshed  editing n t properly done resulting plot felt forced audience n t  the film beautiful watch  its landscapes cgi stunning  first film 
5,classic  disk chronicles narnia  prince caspian  i comment disk came   days order  really delivered fast due combination many situations past month unable watch film  outtakes  etc  i m sure quality excellent  i look forward breathing spell watch 
5,full action  cool scenes  engaging characters   prince caspian  far best narnia movie yet     yes  i seen three several times   there scene two things  named thirst hunger pretty   well  scary younger kids other  great family film 
5,when came  big screen  film nearly well receieved the lion  the witch  the wardrobe  i admit i first saw  i thought quite complex first  however  watching  i bought the l  w  w children could see watching dawn treader theater  opinion changed  i greatly enjoyed film  even differences book   the differences books movies  including dawn treader  might disappoint faithful fans c s  lewis  i understand  yet  ways  differences provide broadened ideas similar truths told  
5,this great movie  it entertaining  i look forward seeing movies series 
2,if enjoyed book  n t watch disney version movie  characterization changed  friendly dwarf became nasty grump  prince caspian king peter jealousy issues   scenes added n t book  basically best parts book omitted  there battles never took place  in fact  fighting main focus movie  anything hint spirituality obliterated movie  if disney wanted create fantasy battle movie  hired someone write  prince caspian definitely not prince caspian c s  lewis wrote  i definitely watch disney adaptations narnia 
3,after incredible debut  the lion  witch  wardrobe   i bit disappointed movie narnia series  the movie n t stick well parts book  obviously flash hollywood  the movie lasts astounding minutes way longer  it tends drag  i found longing credits it s good story kids  provided  hour movie  it promote good values honor loyalty  true narnia series 
4,while i realise pure c s lewis  i think film true spirit  especially christian spirit  books  in fact i found two movies series charming well made  aside  i find ways vibrant compelling lewis  often wooden tales  i hope many see movie  consider vote good family entertainment  for  movies seldom experience anything approaching self indulgence brattiness found harry potter films  frantic pacing  slang dialogue  raunch general noise disney pixar movies  as story  simple good vs bad  there lengthy quest involved  kings queens merely need rally narnians repell occupying army  characters keep us engaged convincingly played actors 
5,i saw  prince caspian  immediately watching  the lion  the witch  wardrobe  tv  i blown away lww  i knew i watch prince caspian get  i n t fan narnia  n t even knew narnia  matter  so i decided watch trailers prince caspian  looked amazing  i watched theater  i blown away  so  i saw three time theaters anyone like movie   it s beyond amazing i dvd  i surely watching every weekend  buy  
3,i disappointed departures written text  when i saw first movie  i left feeling wonderful  this much  i felt like someone trying replicate lord rings  i think c s  lewis would disappointed movie feel missed whole point story for next movie  i hope return story bit 
2,this suppose new dvd however work good  we go video store rent watch 
2,unfortunately  i respectfully disagree commentators  i n t think movie particularly good  it considerably violent  despite caution taken show much blood  innumerable people creatures killed  even heroes  but non stop battles n t serve advance plot much  poor   real character development  while i loved books enjoyed first movie  sadly  i could hardly wait second installment  hopefully ll better next time 
1,i greatly enjoyed book  found almost similarities movie  the plot completely wrong  prince caspian described child book  his uncle speaks though small child  certainly young  aslan minor movie  takes power right  all battle scenes ridiculous  they changed almost everything important  the thing target capture essence reepacheep perfectly  movie huge waste time  love c s  lewis  maybe would like never read book  but honestly book much interesting
2,i thought  the chronicles narnia  lion  witch  wardrobe  brilliant  i could wait movie released theatres  i waited two half years film i disappointed  i thought hardly anything book  there way many things added film like battle miraz s castle  susan caspian love  white witch almost coming back life  none things happened book  in last movie least tried hard stick book  film seemed like effort  i like addition certain creatures like giant walking trees  if read  the chronicles narnia  books  maybe like movie  love books may like film 
3,the movie good see movie  us love books  disappointing  you always expect movies different books  many differences  wardrobe changes  nothing really major  caspian nearly everything different  there battles n t happen book  n t major scenes happen  i really hope dawn treader follows book closely caspian 
3,i people believe book always better movie  this movie good  detach book 
2,thisnd definetly good first  i m big movies always buy blu ray  especially comes animated stuff  younger kids might like much  i n t  i kind lost beginning trying remember last left  would wise decision watch first right watching second  wish would made exciting better overall 
3,prince caspian pretty good  i think first better  little romance thing susan prince caspian little weird  great start collection  probably would n t purchased otherwise 
3,i thought first narnia movie kid friendly  prince caspian slightly darker  but  all in all  good movie  i d recommend friends kids   
5,i ordered movie whole family  we enjoyed first one quick delivery usual  problems   stars 
4,this good movie i liked  since last movie four pevensies narnia together i really desire watch last film the battle scene awesome good first film battle  but n t bad movie  i might buy dvd 
3,the main reason i got movie song near regina spektor  i really liked  i got movie soundtrack itunes  the movie decent  s favorites anything 
5,a bit book terms accuracy  still great story line movie  i m glad 
1,i grew narnia books thought the lion  the witch the wardrobe well adapted big screen  however  prince caspian seemed try add adventures current box office hits rather going strength story  everything seemed top  battlescenes  attempt love line caspian susan  lack quality character improvement  urf  the scenery cinematography n t make lack substance  if n t pull together dawn treader  movie series miss  
4,my  yr old daughter i loved lion  witch  wardrobe  looking forward watching prince narnia  this movie disappoint  we loved story  even romantic element  surpised  s innocent  lot fighting scenes first movie  daughter n t mind  we disappointed  however  due fact dvd n t fun special features  bloopers  like lww dvd 
4,this great fun family movies  the video excellent  the audio   dts master audio disappointing  the audio average far  make top list best sound  audio track  blu ray 
4,i really like  of course i sucker fantasy movies  i even liked golden compass  this better quality first  but n t move much  i seen theater disc  maybe i view  get 
4,this good movie i think first way better  so bad disney n t make another
4,good movie  kids sad movie   older children n t allowed return narnia next installment   their work done  reason given aslan  but still good movie 
4,the first series excellent relationships primary special effects fighting secondary  unfortunately  order got reversed sequel   prince caspian   the special effects astounding  fight scenes nauseum  i wish relationships would developed  i love aslan  get glimpse opposed the lion  witch  wardrobe        let s hope best 
3,it s okay  if ve watched first  n t hurt watch second  it s something kill miss  re looking something watch  
2,i gave installment  the chronicles narnia  two stars special effects  the story really departed book could much better followed book closely  in book  prince caspian young boy  not adult  the disney folks made adult could work love interest queen susan  i n t object love interest movie belongs  in case  totally uncalled  finally  many scenes taken book  for example  aslan s romp bacchus mynaids  other scenes substituted book  over long battle scene king miraz s castle  in installment narnian chronicles  disney rewritten history  for shame  disney 
2,apparently andrew adamson thinks tell better story c s  lewis  saying movie  based  book title would using word  based  loosely  while commonalities two  probably  movie comprised material book  if watching movie without ever read books could called decent story  however  expecting re tell story prince caspian  greatly disappointed once  hollywood thought could improve story re making  failed  a prime example    added  romance  two main characters  this worst addition 
2,i waited anxiously patiently video release prince caspian  as someone read whole narnia series  i greatly disappointed movie  yeah special affects cool  kids probably like movie  but movie deviates far original book would easier list similarities two  anyone fan c s  lewis  books waste time seeing 
1,this movie essentially  hour fight scene minutes half interesting dialogue story sprinkled  terribly violent uninteresting  honestly fighting i ever seen movie  including matrix reloaded   i wholly regret  i spent rent  unless see endless stabbings blunt force traumas  see movie 
5,now i complete set  i ve enjoyed dvd s since first came  i watch quite often 
4,we liked movie   hoursoverall good entertainment linkage first movie good movie scheme darker  close book d like action hd good  depth color stood  much night based takes away bit  blu ray suppose able enhance even night time movie filming  n t seem  two different hd tvs definitely teenager movie  not younger kids recommend 
2,caspian lacks heart charm lion  witch  wardrobe  it felt stale  confusing similar first film  full dazzling critters rushing head first another battle save ancient kingdom whatever  it almost twenty five years since i d read caspian  i n t remember story  i hard time understanding time frame relative lww  i wonder re going gloss the horse his boy  sucked 
5,as always  disney produced another first rate production chronicles narnia  the acting  wardrobe  scenerey graphics flawless leave deep desire  i say extra   less  disney production light years superior mediocre  cheap crud bbc produced 
4,not like first dark story beginning  good special effects  narnia taken different path story line 
2,too long precious  this second narnia film still finds children wartime england waiting train abruptly called back narnia  hundreds years visit wardrobe  evil outsiders threatening overwhelm animals folk narnia s forests  the children eventually save day return train station heroic battles soul searching speechifying  although technically amazing  story drawn sense boredom characters  children  lack strength sharpness made first film enjoyable  it n t film ll watch wardrobe 
3,was good first dvd  truthfully little disappointed 
2,they rushed making quality first  not movie i watch  dissapointed overall opinion 
3,i liked first narnia film extent i kind feel prince caspian  these films n t wonder magic harry potter the lord rings series  in fact favorite part narnia movies talking animals  i seem humans  there good things  hence  stars i gave    outstanding cgi  nice musical score actors average  i desire see narnia world future  it better the golden compass  s bad 
1,the lion the witch wardrobe bad enough  but this effort bad beneath commenting  the negative reviews said 
1,when i ordered book  i hoping get book daughter would teach catholic saints  i think book better read influence hallucinogenics state temporary insanity  i n t know author coming  take review however  i do not recommend this book

3,i sorely disappointed otherwise lovely addition abridged  perhaps stated somewhere product description  i missed  returning 
3,the book beautiful  beautifully bound  my slight disappointment purchase nowhere description i find book abridged  i chose edition classic illustrations  stunning  book gift ten year old granddaughter  i certainly abridged version that said  book treasure price 
1,when publishers abridge classics the wind willows must respectful  and make determinations child absorb enjoy  it sad cut  the piper gates dawn  edition  children get something valuable contemplatve texts  allow access 
2,i bought copy kenneth grahame s wonderful classic illustrations lovely  when i read book however  i realized book  albeit beautiful illustrations  heavily abridged  i sorely disappointed  feel clearly marked labeling book 
4,this book perks considerably  first  installment midshipman hornblower  told outside perspective  works admirably  thanks likable relatable narrator   zips along high stakes  good action  worthwhile character development  looking forward next series 
4,c s  forester created superb naval drama gave inside look life sailor serving royal navy wooden ship renown  with hornblower  companion bush dealing befuddled captain fighting attacks spanish book kept reading page page  i believe best books hornblower series i would encourage anyone eye historical novels check series 
3,this book weaker followup fast paced mr midshipman hornblower  first book series  the novel really picks half way book  first half slow n t carry action included second half book  the final third novel interesting carries action introduces maria character  well solidifying relationship hornblower bush  overall  i thought enjoyable i still bit disappointed reading first novel  i felt incredible filled great action solid writing 
3,these shirts bargain  but price  warned buying light thin shirts  i problem shoulder seam arm length  compared better quality shirts  cacharel seems longer stated size  i find shoulder hangs lower  s  it may  s oddity worth mentioning  while quality best  price  s bad deal  overall  i m satisfied 
4,i think pretty nice shirt bucks  something comparative k  g would run    it  tag  i m sure  good daily dress shirt i ll

4,this book gives excellent insight booker t s life  the unknowns  lack childhood fear existed unimaginable  this book gives inspiration would thinking giving 
5,i ordered grandson  book filled history  history forgotten  contributed much society  produced great black like obama  it n t  would ve never achieved accomplishments 
4,wow  what amazing story  it fascinating read booker t washington s account childhood slavery followed rise national prominence founder tuskegee institute while may argue washington naive overly accomodating  i amazed ability forgive see best people  he nurse grudges let others bring  whether feel spoken judicial equality  admit strong  dedicated character everyone  white  black  brown  shade  benefit reading autobiography great american 
3,rather seeing piece puzzle america s race relations history  invest instead larger norton anthology american literature another compendium washington work excerpted others periods  the knowledge greater context  speaker s  writer s  words mind expanding 
3,i feel washington s book much like  two faced  it may true needed white support order get money blacks i feel n t tell story way told  slavery lot harsher washington wrote  book carefree dealing harshness slavery  he wrote book white read could get support money  he benedict arnold black folk 
3,i read up from slavery african american lit class  totally applauled  washigton complaicent  even angry white people four hundred years slavery  the debate washington web dubois famous  wash wanted black people forgive forget continue southerners work dogs  dubois wanted negro race embrace higher education follow footsteps wealthy americans like rockefeller carnegie  which plan better uplifting race  it depends upon direction country going turn century 
2,i thought supposed autobiography  all talks school  he mentions wife kids twice  i got impression selfish  plus  top  book boring 
2,this book talks slavery positive light  two thirds book telling school opened  briefly mentioning personal home life 
5,i decided read book vacation  the story booker talliaferro washington touched heart  i year old white born booker t washingtons home state virginia  it hurt think great slave  a genius calibre held  it wish people could read story  i humbled i read book  i wish legacy endured among black population country  his message hope education love labor rewards profound statement love commitment race  he mind greatest ever lived  god bless memory  please read book

3,very interesting perspective slavery someone actually lived  all slave tales alike 
5,i knew next nothing booker t washington prior reading book  now i feel honored story shared  despite risk sounding cliche  become inspiration hero  if convictions spirit  would quite ordinary  instead  accomplished incredible goals  overcoming unimaginable feats  reached inumerable amount people  generation generation  this book mainstay bedside table  required reading 
3,when i bought book i expecting classic reprint book  not modern print  i buy something amazon i expect receive i ordered  i n t refund anything like  book got job done  i wish express much means customers get order something else 
5,i greatly enjoyed book  i admire booker t washington endless pursuit education  this book great inspiration student  the thing i disappointed fact mr washington get personal family life  i agree school change person  and i believe education greatly shape person  i n t belive education thing molds us  i would loved find much mr washington s private life i learned schooling  work schools  despite  i think book wonderful  if know high school student  college student  give book gift  it good read 
3,the author highly instrumental bringing process  he educated completed schooling hampton  school honors  he built directed tuskegee  school alabama  devoted whole life service  while book informative  considered milestone true pioneer  little bit monotonous  thus three stars  i would highly recommend nevertheless  many thoughts  attitudes  sayings booker t washington used modern authors speakers  live forever  our country black race forever debt legacy left behind  i certainly feel better life reading book  you 
2,i watched took diet consultant dr she reviewed research found vegitarian  oil diet video tried found lacking validity diabetes blood sugar control  my advice  see diet specialist stay local dr  this video gives old advice 
2,there numbers opinions diabetes  dr  barnard certainly worth finding  i m still sorting whether way i go i think claim  cure   hype discredits main point  i n t dismissed yet 
2,not great  the first section informative rest waste of time unless your a vegitarian
5,in past  i tried tried keep journal n t keep  i would write days forget write  whenth birthday rolled around  mom got  dreams a notebook journal  told try keep  since birthday  i written everyday  i love journal s design pages look inside  i would recommend young girl looking good journal write personal thoughts dreams

1,factually shaky many points  pedestrian prose  self aggrandizing page turner wanting finish awful thing  what i found offensive book author s egotistical disdain   lesser climbers   team  in fact fellow leaders showed nothing hostility many members smug  arrogant jerks  having climbing expeditions  great deal stress  raw feelings  etc  raw condescending behavior author trip leaders disgusting  do n t even get started ugly american  analysis  asians denali read book day write mountaineering book point every flaw 
1,i give book star made nice lining bird cage  others described  eloquently i  good book read  i found author mean  pompous racist  as climber many years i honestly say i would never tie rope 
2,i found author overly dramatic dreadfully overused tired cliches crude  offensive language  she absoulutely obsessed outdoor urination defication  the redeeming quality book s meticulous description boredom trapped storm days small frozen tent  she talks offended people interested deaths gore  yet endlessly talks body bags  removal dead koreans  etc  if know climbing every conceivable angle  s worth read  n t expect much 
3,i n t disagree criticisms writing  i admit i reading book  i found story compelling  yes  into thin air much better overall much better written  give woman break  still interesting account refreshing hear female climber stuck male climbing world  for hour took read  i develop animosity towards author simply kept reading find happens  and boy i glad able walk outside get sun i finished 
2,i agree others reviewers kocuour s ego huge obstacle reading book  i m reminded people conversation nothing bad mouth others compensate lack confidence  everyone else weak  unrefined  stupid  otherwise worth mocking  i m stuck passage gets mocks fellow climber brought book read jet airplanes  that s depth goes pettiness the story interesting compelling  getting past author s tone soured reading experience me i many mountaineering books  ones i d heartily recommend joe tasker peter boardman s  the boardman tasker omnibus   jim whittaker s  a life edge  peter potterfield s  in zone   these authors write well  convey challenges trials mountaineering without narcissism  these books proudly bookcase  kocuour s book cardboard box basement 
1,this book would joke dangerous  there s nothing wrong guided mountain   fact  may comparatively safe way enjoy outdoor experience  keeps many climbers employed  there s nothing wrong writing experience guided   david roberts  jon krakauer  others done entertainingly tastefully  but title  extreme   true courage   death defying survival   quest  shows serious signs self delusion  i concerned innocent pick book  enjoy  something really stupid hint  if liked book   really found exciting   stay home   star  honor book s value kindling  lower rating  
2,scrolling reviews facing the extreme  easy pick  words  type climber i would choose climb i would  kocour s mean spirited book clearly gives climbers women bad in fact  best lesson gleaned chronicle arrogant self serving woman  choose team members carefully possible whenever possible  the insightful comment made reviewers said would roped ruth anne kocour  who would 
2,i agree many reviewers  criticisms kocour s writing style contemptuous attitude toward climbers  i would add refer experience  extreme  shows complete lack credibility climber  ms kocour bored  cold scared  feet got cold   s  meanwhile  others died storm  if read  extreme  experience denali  try davidson s minus waterman s in shadow denali  i second recommended boardman tasker omnibus 
2,i thoroughly enjoyed book  it quick paced gripping  the problem i put   i felt sour  like i d cooped mountain bunch bumbling idiots three weeks   that stuck   could whole point book    to convey    was n t something important convey  like kocour s experience mountain  importantly   i wonder feels sour  still  
2,the know mountaineering  funnier ll find book  there little like  much laugh ruth ann s utterly unselfconscious self portrait if comic novel would dead on parody certain strain self glorifying mountaineering literature  think nicholson baker writing  into thin air  point view sandy hill pittman  and starts twenty two word long title  warning  re mood laugh  prepared annoyed 
4,both wife i read book almost sitting  compelling  her descriptions cold  storm  relationships climbers right on  this world climbing exists today  gives excellent insite high mountain disasters recent history  i ve climbed mountains higher feet  several winter ascents required technical ability  i m professional mountain climber i ve never hired guide  but i probably hire guide day  to put book author n t full time mountain climber weak  i professional life outside mountain climbing  that s reality modern climbing  experiance somehow less authentic  this author  writing compelling  i enjoyed immensely 
2,after reading jon krakauer s book  i  unfortunately  i choose ruth ann kocour s book  reads like account life threatening adventure told adolescent  although journalist  recounting conversations ring true  voices  sound alike  and i appreciated insight bodily functions handled mountain  mature attitude would gone long way 
1,i chose book sheer desperation i looking good investment book holidays this book far slanted toward fundamentalist approach i believe author thinks graham buffett gods  it reads poorly author could imparted message less pages the author denigrades technical analysis choice statistics hold water well in view big let  i wish i could get time money back

3,seemed like things movie wernt explained much  you follow whats going  happened  etc seemed like many holes  the direction half time  it cool scenes could much better movie
4,kitano s first   feature film foray english language territory  brother may kitano simplest  certainly coolest  since hana bi  anyway kitano plays disgraced yakuza foot soldier whose extreme behaviour sees exiled us  younger brother lives  kitano starts new life exactly old life left  extreme violence this kitano height self destructive performances  separated  family   adrift banal culture  little understanding language  fast fiery rise power bested rapid decline one gripe  going see features  particularly commentaries  kitano dvds  even zatoichi barren dvd basics

1,do n t get wrong   harriet spy   time favorite books  movies   growing  i m almost always wanted read  the long secret   so re reading harriet  i went bookstore ordered copy  well  first n t bad  really n t real point story  harriet n t matured much  make matters worse  really offensive hostile notes left place  i christian find offensive phrase  jesus hates you   allowed published children s book  this especially true day age  almost threat potential turn violent skip 
1,a previous reviewer said teacher s found students never fail enjoy william golding s the inheritors  when reviewer sophomore english student  i assure i failed enjoy book  my teacher thought book all time literary greats  i thought boring and i even bigger reason dislike book  i happen hate reading screeds trash author s ancestors  i m sure homo sapiens perfect  please show race culture people are my plea high school english teachers everywhere  if must require students read golding  read lord of the flies  it s marginally better the inheritors  i remember correctly  include ancestor bashing 
1,unfortunately  i forced read novel english class  it extremely difficult due fact main characters n t mastered little thing like call language yet  because golding refuses help reader along proper narration  outcome nothing short migrane  just wanted give presently sane people little warning throwing sanity away attempting decipher meaning book 
3,i would n t read book didnt need university class  however i enjoy  wo n t read good quick read 
3,at first glance book seems tell story kind makes little sense points baisic  this first notion n t true  when read carefully study start get sense great complexity book  if read book class make sure read couple times really n t seems 
2,this book frustrated  while i respect endeavor write book perspective prehistoric  n t follow  while golding s theme dichotomous intriguing  switching character character  clarifying  generally unengaging characters made average reading experience 
2,i n t think golding quite got hang early humans using subjects  there far far interesting exciting things simply missing story  not bad read  expectations 
2,i found disjointed  often confusing  description clash two human groups  golding missed good opportunity create compelling case neanderthals could compete new  advanced  humans 
2,but points way much  although plot interesting characters scene well developed  dedicated reading novel  in sections difficult understand going  unless prepared read pages  may try something else 
2,this kind record gives jazz bad  russell gunn  young trumpeter note  offers set mostly bebop chestnuts supposedly given fresh reading  instead  get esoteric  virtuoso  insider treatments  yes  stunning moments  yes  fine assemblage something jazzers play butts  generally comes across cold academic  ideosyncratic  listener unfriendly set pieces  where s warmth  vitality  craziness make jazz surprizing engaging music  not disc  i m sorry say

4,washington dc thoroughly planned city  evolve haphazardly  those looked map dc spot immediately symmetry structures city  this book well researched argument behind city structure lies masonically inspired tribute virgo  i enjoyed parts book  found presumed familiarity and or sympathy astrology could used thorough editing process  i found book jumped around lot i trouble following themes  i would recommend book live work washington dc always suspected something suspicious behind symmetry  ability get bogged much astrological arcana 
3,i drawn book title  after good start early history planning capital george washington l enfant  including freemasonic influences foundation stone ceremony cornerstone ceremony  author zeroes main thrust book  analysis astrological signage scattered around capital area might mean  perhaps george washington  l enfant early capital architects astrology  i n t know  perhaps sign virgo supernatural significance well capital country  i n t know  i know  needs believe astrology book credibility  to make long story short  book disappointment 
2,honsetly read first chapters  it difficult follow   the author jumped back forth timelines  if follow  i m sure good facts   but i could n t keep 
1,there much said book except total hogwash  not even author pull undocumented assumption together sensible hypothesis 
3,comprehensive ways  book overlooks dramatic examples secrets clearly encoded designers capital city

5,  the story patty bergen s great story actually quite believable  i really recommend reading 
3,summer of my german soldier well written book young girl wwii  the main character  patty  faced many conflicts necessarily related  it little depressing  book i would recommend fun read  it hard get  boring  if someone ask read  i would tell better books 
4,this book compelling story young lost jewish girl n t know belonged  her parents love  keep good town  kept around  she befriended natzi prisoner help loving cook  ruth  kept secret friend hidden world rejected found love would always remembered never replaced  and reading i definitly recomend book   
2,would ever excepted world war ii jewish girl befriend germain  how nazi  this book breaking rules following heart  patty comes family person loves maid ruth  but  changes day working father s shop pow soilders meets like rest  he handsome  smart  extremely liturate  after time meeting think  one night sees  going trying hope train see calls comes see  she hides garage  she sees  add paper saying anton missing camp  she questioned agents  so tell everything know  or save germain soidier

2,this book misses one important fact  hurricane katrina did n t stop in biloxi gulfport mississippi  but also included cities further east that never received mention but fared just as bad if not worse than gulfport or biloxi  this includes the cities of ocean springs  gautier  pascagoula in mississippi and as far east as mobile alabama  if time is going to present an accurate account of hurricane as such it deserves i would think they could at least do enough research to find out about these cities and include them in their book  maybe it is because these cities are so small they figure why bother  and maybe that is why it took so long for these same cities to receive aid after the devestation caused by hurricane katrina  whatever the case  this book misses the whole point 
2,this book  like written portraying hurricane katrina  leads reader conclusion new orleans area devastated thereby  for anyone s information  new orleans west  weak  side katrina  new orleans flooded   elevation  feet below level   levy system never built withstand  greater storms  every drop rain falls new orleans pumped  way  if citizens new orleans put money improving levy system instead superdome  might well living dry undamaged homes today instead morning dead trying put city back together  new orleans rebuilt someday i hope pray learned benefited disaster n t make mistakes  if read look balanced book coverning hurricane katrina  n t

4,peter lawrence strikes balanced tone account madang cargo cults   considering work early mid twentieth century  this book cited various authors  frederick errington deborah gewertz  debate meaning yali s question  people cargo  others  beyond much  lawrence clearly agenda predjudices  highly readable account fascinating period human history  visible us pacific  may rehearsed various guises many periods history  pidgin english fascinating subject  i must learn  it seems work like inverted mirror humans industrialised societies recognise reflection  road belong cargo  indeed

1,this book proves unconstitutional  i believe john yoo teaches uc berkeley  i would ashamed call professor patriot writing book like 
1,professor yoo s writing style nearly befuddled confused understanding constitutional law  i say without fear contradiction far ill conceived  unsubstantive pointless books i ever misfortune read  his theories assertions never clearly backed real documentation legal reasoning fails miserably making clear concise point  i feel book nothing total waste time  perhaps professor yoo stick writing legal arguments  style case substance  n t really matter 
1,yoo s arguments favor essentially unchecked executive fly everything founders intended creating great country  he undoubtedly intelligent  given prowess manipulates constitution legal precepts seemingly supporting theory  despite packaging  however  fundamental basis theory fatally flawed  he  core  merely opportunist advocates theories sole purpose furthering career  rather actually merit  in words  s hack heart  this book n t worth time money 
1,the author book hates freedom book unsupported constitution bill rights

2,we purchased microwave october  minus  rebate  panasonic denied first rebate submission  claiming d bought wrong item  a phone call cleared misunderstanding apparently rebate way  however  i ve since told rebate problems denials common occurrence panasonic the microwave nice appearance functions well  however  significant design flaw  you use hood light nightlight even keep long without heating inside microwave point internal fan comes microwave turn cook  after oven cools  seems function normally  the first time happened  inside oven hot i thought short circuit  for reason  i recommend buying appliance  i wonder price dropped dramatically  
3,the draw back model exhaust fan noise  i believe loud  other i please performance microwave 
1,the first received dead box  it made loud grinding sounded like fan hitting metal  we assumed due shipping damage received replacement  the replacement worked fine six months suddenly display panel would go blank clock would reset minutes  the microwave ceased functioning altogether  the warranty states  in home  service  local service facilities 
2,i high hopes perfume  i previously used creme brulee perfume bathwerks absolutely amazing  i yet find replacement  the laura mercier perfume smells artificial  cloying 
4,the disparaging thing i say book caused purchase better dictionary

3,every song movie replaced inferior version elton john album  best score elements discovering eldorado climbing pyramid simply included  possibly due licensing issues original musicians  it gets   presence good tracks though 
4,i like cd  s nothing amazing  it s got pretty good tunes although i recommend  would n t missing anything n t buy 
4,elton john returns seductive tracks release  the melodies strong sounds great  particular stand outs include  someday out of the blue   first single   trust me     my heart dances     friends never say goodbye   a ej tracks would better instrumentals included album  overall fine body work  the first single probably catchiest songs release  good follow up single would  trust me   
3,first saw movie songs amazing bought soundtrack dollars back changed songs wish cd original score plaese dont buy listening
1,some reviews correct  great elton john record  but i didnt buy listen elton john  i bought get music movie i disappointed  while elton john indeed good artist  i wanted  the makers cd cheated anyone else fan movie  they set soundtrack get money  instead nothing elton john music which gets star 
1,what lousy soundtrack suprisingly fun movie  some actual score pieces decent  none elton s songs album worth even brief listen  save money buy  goodbye yellow brick road    madman across water   
2,from objective reviewer   soundtrack pop full elton whereas the lion king star album  stars double fluff 
1,elton john peaked songwriter mid s even able tweak decent hit every throughout s early s  today  elton john s music become exciting listen trip shopping mall  his songwriting become formulistic predictable see lion king part x years full blown vegas style show  elton legend whose status much owed music created years ago  today  seems comical legend become comical parody  i think i still write hit  composer seems endless supply adult  diseny  contemporary  melodies variations theme schmaltz 
2,thinking cd music taken movie  resung elton john  songs lost flavor looking  re elton john fan probably would like
3,unfortunately  cd i initially expecting  i hoped would full soundtrack movie  including hysterical  it s tough god   i somewhat disappointed song particular appear movie  the scores sweeping music delight  i truly hoped songs remain unchanged overall  good purchase fun cd listen  i would recommend elton john fan  he great job  especially  friends never say goodbye    the trail we blaze   the energetic pop numbers fun entertaining  a great album  flaws opinion 
4,as pretty keen follower elton s music  nice suprise hear new album hear instantly clear deliberate return standards set post s albums made england   sleeping past    low  zero ice fire   there self indulgent introspection experimentation  music sake music  singable melodies good thick chords  i agree earlier review comments voice piano prominent mix making big difference  great hear big fella go 
5,our local reviewer said  show tunes diminish el dorado   excuse  i reviewing album  movie  i love cd  and show tunes  i think s great  i ve listened  weeks  consider fav  show tunes order   the trail we blaze     it s tough be a god   but i like th century man  reminds new orleans  funk   i m south la  thanks  elton john  something new refreshing  you win  book 
4,the fact soundtrack animated movie gon turn people  s bad  wonderful sophisticated piece work insanely talented person   it s bad  somewhere blue  chosen single released radio  it may weakest track album  it s horrible  pales others  the title track great   friends never say goodbye  beautiful  th century man  absolute classic  great lyrics tim rice   and others n t disappoint either i loved lion king soundtrack   collections like  along recent soundtracks like  tarzan   deserve rightful places among best works respective artists  it s great see outstanding music movies  unfortunate many never get hear cartoon characters cover 
4,elton john done   someday  favorite track   friends never say goodbye  another potential hit  john great job background vocals incredible 
1,  el dorado  fails levels  truly  cd avoid  elton s fans avoid lackluster rhythms  simple chromatic melodies  call  banal tim rice lyrics forced rhymes  disney film fans  not lion king central american jungle  there grand opening melodic sweep like  circle light   instead ve got moronic repetition  el dorado   there ballads like  can hear love    s nothing compare  and comic songs n t clever  although  it s tough god  comes close  one last comment  i could buy spanish rhythms  main characters spanish  hell country western sound picture  dreamworks  rival disney  get phil collins music next time 
3,  i still think music lyrics largely repetitive  after seeing movie  i think worst thing branagh kline version  it s tough be god  left  i would added another star  i like soundtrack s version  the trail we blaze  better movie s  songs pleasant   without question  still seems somewhat place  elton john fans probably enjoy album  animated feature fans may skip 
4,i m huge fan elton john  i loved cd  i hoping music movie  especially kline branagh version  it s tough be a god   i happy i got  i hope dreamworks releases another cd  score kline branagh song  i m still happy cd 
4,great elton john  tim rice collaboration  it s bound bebetter movie  my complaint  sections  friends never say goodbye  sound so much like bits  the madness king scar  elton rice s  the lion king   major boo boo watch sparks fly  sorry guys  little flaw overshadows whole album  pity  cause s bloody good stuff 
3,i m disapointed soundtrack release simple reason contain actual soundtrack movie  missing cd wonderful score hans zimmer john powell  except couple short tracks stuck almost thought seems  and orchestral accompaniment elton john s songs sadly lacking well  also  reason songs soundtrack album even film  i hope folks dreamworks remedy situation releasing  real  musical score film separate cd sometime soon  this cd fans elton john  fans movie music 
2,i disappointed discover really soundtrack movie  the thing cd common movie song titles  i would preferred combination elton john signing tracks voice talents movie others  this cd like road el dorado set elevator music   thumbs 
3,this great bag except complaint zipper main compartment  because zips across side puts lot stress fabric around corner  after i bag  months fabric began tear  i called jj cole great  i mailed bag back sent new  hopefully last longer  my favorite part seperate diaper pad  it works great 
5,oh i love book  vimala thakar writes beautifully gives lots think about i bought book suggested reading list om girl  blog   then i went buy book raja yoga  she elegant insightful i glad i found her i keep book forever day i skilled yoga teacher  i use class read quotes 
2,i expecting much video  it kids poses  hard find year old  some circle games looked like might fun  i wanted show third grade class  i n t think would hold interest  all i felt i watching someone s home video family yoga 
3,this copy another reprint  green book  series n t contain great maps originals 
3,this book ie okay boring ilike confusing  there lot people book hard keep people book  the pictures book good  they help get better picture book people look like  the book hard understand get middle  then gets confusing  there little boy father father base army  the little boy gets experience things young age  one good parts title fits tells chapter going tell  the book could better okay  i army freak ok 
2,the book i ordered gift  i sure enjoy reading took long time get  disappointed 
2,i started read  the greatest generation  hope would contribute world war ii history  i really say  i found repetitive  i challenge notion world war ii generation  greatest generation  patriotism displayed  we individuals display similar patriotism throughout history  especially since world war ii  a recent example pat tillman  arizona cardinal safety give millions join army rangers gave life afghanistan  i find interesting mr brokaw admires world war ii generation patriotism yet objected fellow journalists wearing american flag 
3,brokaw good job capturing glory world war ii  he discusses shameful acts country period  however  book valuable skinny look times  it valuable teaching history glosses issues events  it good book  great book  for great book world war ii  look elsewhere 
2,greater generations americans  what generations women formed nation  built states  towns  farms  died battlefields revolution  war civil war   in short  people made possible even american wwii generation  in opinion  wwii generation earns different title  the most arrogant generation  remember gave us cold war  mccarthyism segregation  it wwii generation  led  nation vietnam   some leadership   actually  i think brokaw meant say  wwii generation last great american generation  what pessimist  thank god young folks 
3,some interesting stories like period american history  as title  i reminded quote abraham lincoln generation civil war   human nature change  in future great national trial  compared  shall weak strong  silly wise  bad good   
5,my mom appreciative gift  she vivid memories time history pleased receive book says time united united states ever see agian  sad 
5,thanks  i purchased dad  he part generation  many thanks 
3,as us born  war  look back upon history realize truly fortunate adults period mentors  teachers  parents friends  brokaw good job telling stories  some stories similar portions repeated reasons book tends lose excitement  not everything good exciting  however  the book interesting  i knew people  i would recommend young person  if read  know many truly great sacrifices made us young adults  a good book 
5,a lot reviews make book s simplicity style negative  surprise since n t read like textbook fact makes history human   significant 
2,my father served europe ww ii  like many g  i  s returned home foreign born wife  it disappointing mention soldiers brides book  the individual stories good far go  brokaw trivializes flowery comments repeated  some celebrity stories art buchwald s entertaining  celebrity names mentioned without account individual s experiences  would call dropping  i agree reviewers liked stories found pooly written 
1,do n t bother reading book  brokaw s sham teach nothing second world war  instead  read studs terkel s the good war anything paul fussell  better yet  go talk veteran   we re lucky re still around 
2,tom brokaw chosen fanastic topic  baby boomers  parents  their life  times  trials  stamina depression     raising families  i wish author bit distance vision would done actual writing book  as  brokaw cannonizes subjects poor job telling real story  i hope topic gets explored someone brokaw  little talent writer  i disappointed reading book i made mistake buying gift copies elderly vet friend  neighbors  father without pre reading  live learn  i guess  sorry  i expectations thrilled book   n t 
3,this book provides great deal insight lives character individuals lived ww period  except obligatory chapters  required political correctness  individuals n t contribute anything live period  i feel worthwhile book  as brokow pointed  greatest insights comparing today s generation individuals greatest generation  and forces us comtemplate future like current generation charge  we hope best 
3,i first admit tom brokaw place heart america  unfortunately however  book  though offers much deserved tribute great generation perhaps much important lesson youth today many points tedious dull read conceptually interesting  breaking life synopsis  brilliant  however  often read like bad book report   here facts peron s life  done   james bradley s flags fathers  leave feeling much obliged greatest generation 
2,rather letting subjects tell stories brokaw interjects politics philosophy  i donated copy city library  instead  read studs terkel s  the good war   it    brokaw could     would imitated master oral biographer 
2,the beginning ending narrative touched heart great state south dakota walked many small cemeteries veterans flags tombstones mark sites fallen  other stories shallow uninteresting  lacking depth insight effect individuals  let s  post prosperity brought veterans success enjoy today  i n t think much military experiences  joe foss revered south dakotans extent throwing al neuharth really clutching straws really parents wwii veterans sacrificers  moralists  conservers  workers  survivors get credit 
2,my cryptic summary trying condense fact individual stories interesting  put together start run together sameness  the indivudal accomplishments throughout book well generation accomplished undeniably fantastic  however  brokaw s book ramrods home volume i simply could n t anymore  i wanted like book  i ll ambrose s d day book anyday 
3,this book lives world war ii veterans  i see many people like  this book good job giving details  the details make book feel personal  they allow really get know people stories  unfortunately  details make book seem boring  i would liked better details focused action trivial issues  maybe  day  i old  i m   i re read get enjoyment  i find several stories rather interesting  i enjoyed reading way african american veterans treated  another problem i book tom brokaw little conservative  everybody  except guy makes  mallard fillmore  comic strip  knows liberals fun     
4,  the greatest generation  inspiring  as young adult i yet experience anything  the horror stories exactly  stories  while reading book i taken aback  the generation today   those kids return many experiences world war ii  it unusual sad see differences  the greatest generation   generation today  the stories book ones hope  love  courage  bravery  overcoming adversity  they happy  sad  inspiring  i enjoyed reading people everyone known heard  way people go unheard unspoken  tom brokaw wonderful job capturing aspects world war ii middle battle  women fighting battles home  only time tell recent wars could potentially transform generation similar  the greatest   
5,reading book makes sad dad gone i never asked  what  daddy   what opportunity i missed 
2,my father book shelf i picked last christmas break polished afternoon  obvious tom little book  if read introduction  essentially thanks everybody found various stories book  the book nothing collection compiled stories tom brokaw s book jacket  hey tom  write stories 
4,wonderful collection stories wwii heros nice commentary nbc newsman  women minorities dutifully included  exception homosexual community  tom s researchers could ve dug wee bit deeper  but  s beautiful book well written  moving remembrances photographs 
2,half book tom reading events high school history book  i expected book contain  letters disappointed half book contained unwanted history review  it seems tom trying capitalize generation s tragedy  his reading factual events adds almost nothing understanding letters 
4,this book much offer  for younger generation  offers us glimpse something ve told  n t truly grasp world war ii brought best nation  we came together common cause united ever  the young women generation  age younger  the greatest generation without doubt these amazing people shared stories mr brokaw  incredible learn personal contributions people made sake country i recommend book anyone wants greater appreciation sacrifices previous generations  this book move  wholeheartedly new appreciation people 
2,this book mainly brokaw s love republican politicians served world war two  little else  the average gi n t seem matter  there interesting parts  black veterans treated   book fails miserably 
5,i shocked anyone could find book  tedious condescending   i must vehemently disagree reviewer states the greatest generation  minimizes every generation people   it thing  moving tribute generation deserves tribute  if n t struggles heroism generation  might today  the reviewer i refer writes   mr brokaw others think generation n t faced death  despair  fear  illness poverty  truly connected world live   to reviewer  i must say current generations baby boomers gen x ers not struggle massive level lived  died  depression world wars  today s  myriad stresses cloud everyday life  compared stresses endured brokaw rightly calls  great generation   
3,noble try  right instincts  there must surely interesting stories  little energy  though intention touching  book bogged laboring touch segments society politically correct  did i really give  stars 
1,sure  generation  alternative  in opinion  generation run world s greatest debt   leave kids pay tab when n t send children  created vietnam  after killing us  decided maybe n t good idea afterall when decided n t pay medical bills  created medicare  and guess pays  they underfunded retirement  and guess pays  they built highway system  and guess pays  they poluted environment like never  guess pays clean mess i agree brokaw point  generation greatest thing   avoiding responsibility 
3,i read brokaw s sequel   the greatest generation speaks  reading  second book far better  those stories  submitted directly readers response  greatest generation   compelling inspiring original  since rely contributors  letters rather brokaw s  interviews   and  speaks  successfully avoids tedious repetition  political shading denigration boomer generation flaws work  read sequel first  tackle must 
3,overall  i enjoyed book  however  i felt greatest generation given short shrift brokaw s concentration experiences  this parents  generation always apparent greatest strengths  weaknesses  forged depression world war ii  yet significance could better shown many accomplishments  failings  shaping post wwii america  maybe opportunity real sequel  follow up book  greatest generation speaks  recycling material used book 
3,i appreciate tom brokaw s praise  greatest generation   pages i began feel i reading exact story  i found many ways mr brokaw could make point  concluding paragraphs story began sound  i agree readers said book goes  brokaw begins sound like little boy awe running original ways articulate point  i say  however  i still glad i read brokaw s novel  repetative  paints informative warm  biased  picture generation certainly remembered forever 
1,i quite let lack real substance information accounts  it great subject shallow treatment hold interest  ambrose s citizen soldiers much  much better 
1,the story good first three chapters  story new names  highly overrated 
2,yes  yes  served  heroes  course   done i could ever do somehow forgot instill children values this greedy  immoral  non compassionate culture now you n t get claim  greatest  without passing something they passed irresponsible yuppie elite  short sighted corporate executives  hollywood suits giving us crappy movie crappy movie these offspring so called  greatest generation   to earn title ensure future better   n t  bred horribly self entitled litter jerks tom  great newsman  took wrong side   may great people  horrible parents instilled terrible values kids 
5,brokaw commendable job describing  greatest generation  earned  for interested generation likely next great  i highly recommend new book titled  millennials rising  generational authors neil howe bill strauss  they believe cycle generations  today s youngsters  millennials  born present   replace g i  generation next great generation  the millennials already reversing many negative social trends associated last generation young adults  i e  generation xers 
1,i really looked forward book  based respect tom brokaw i heard  unfortunately  makes point sledgehammer  telling sapppy stories theme  spoon feeding point  case somehow missed  grandma grandpa great  generous  self sacrificing gods goddesses  thousand treacly repetitive stories  this book condescends reader  unfortunately  probably good intentions annoying results  i n t able finish book  s rare 
4,with true stories simple american heroes  the greatest generation worthy comparison best books women fought wwii  the winds war  the stephen ambrose books  the triumph  glory mind  perhaps greatest praise greatest generation that even tom brokaw was able to recognize honor and decency when he saw it  there s hope nbc news yet 
1,this greatest generation  this last bigoted generation  bigotry today exists smaller smaller pockets  hangovers generation brokaw prostrates  my older friend tells likes working younger generation gets treated like equal instead subordinate  says really  greatest generation n t even like  is tom brokaw make buck old it better time  malarkey  stupid  given already wealthy  never struck idiot  i m going option  wanted limelight  by way  book repetitive  if great  n t examples call schmaltz delivered time 
3,i somewhat disappointed book  needless say exploits generation outstanding  done  i m inclined think generation produced tom s  greatest generation  greatest generation  i disappointed celebrity selections  his good stories  i believe better stories 
1,it worth buying  if must read go public library  you might thank 
2,coming heels terrific movie  saving private ryan   brokaw s book sadly repetitive  one would think world war ii greatest thing humanity capable  there alot interesting anecdotes  much point   greatest generation  go produce  smug baby boomers  unfortunately  s legacy 
3,not great book interesting grew s went wwii  enjoyed reading 
5,tom brokaw provides book extends beyond dry facts makes events lives alive reader personal accounts people interviewed  highly memorable 
2,you would dead touched stories book  i found mr brokaw s writing style bit dry  the writing ended sucking life stories 
3,this book well written mandatory reading congress  president  joint chiefs staff consider sending anyone  brokaw vividly describes  wwii particular  effects individuals  those combat well stay behind  where book falls short  however  brokaw s theory greatest generation  this book could written generation fought civil war  wwi  also  individuals writes often disprove arguments  for example  several times early chapters brokaw writes generation n t believe divorce  it n t option  later book  however  talks individual  ex wives   this n t contradiction book  brokaw s attempt make book prove something detracts would otherwise excellent book 
2,mr brokaw could n t possibly imagine conditions young living called upon save nation mr brokaw found mostly officers interview  went service officers  later became politicians  where uneducated  poverty stricken youths went armed forces  fought died country   survived  returned former lives little better drafted  the author never mentioned fact machinery always place keep rich youths service  making service armed forces strictly voluntary  always officers  most repeat  never heard shot fired  exception proving rule
2,while i know brokaw newsman journalist  much linear style effects otherwise compelling stories lived fought country 
4,this book interesting colaboration stories tom brokaw  it takes place world war  touches every subject combat heroes overseas heroes america making supplies overseas  i really enjoyed book even though stories little slow action packed  still writen good insight give feeling actually know person  there many women put lives line country need remembered youth america learn lessons telling  overall good book good explanations descriptions even occasional story i think left 
4,if word comes mind i read brokaw s book word  character   what lacking culture character  it seems character emerges culture experienced great hardship  deprivation  danger overcoming great odds  our generation  baby boomers  everything given  we expect feel effort challenge hard work unacceptable  as result generation lacking  character   
3,brokaw makes good point  s delivered  spots  rather tediously  there better books world war ii  professional historians  world war ii participants  try bat bomb totally unique memoir world war ii  world war ii buffs n t know bat bomb  like biblical scholars n t know noah s ark  and slight exaggeration  
2,i high hopes worthwhile topic  reads like mr brokaw presenting report late news  i expected developed presentation 
2,first person history better ideas historical community decades  instead  big movers  picture  movement looks actual  little people  make bulk involved history giving idea life times   however  book live ideal  far  short stories  short tales hard times overcome participation war  much colored brokaw s political bias  glowing descriptions progressive heroes  large percentage portrayed  poor history  old saw fdr saving nation rather actual fault causing depression s problems    there likely better books subject  time look likely disappoint anyone truly wanting learn times people involved
2,i veteran wwii disappointed book  it totally devoid emotion  brokaw generates real sympathy characters result much like reading dull history book filled statistics  with subject matter available able bring many tears eyes reader  i suggest brokaw read flags our fathers discover real writing 
3,brokaw s book interesting information individuals came age fight world war two  but premise  the greatest generation  wrong  if knowledge american history would realize every generation  least revolution world war two   particularly  fought civil war world war one  shared characteristics attributes world war two generation  this n t detract stories presents accurate analysis would define generations followed world war two changed preceding generations  that  seems  point really trying make 
2,  the greatest generation  admirable goal  falls short due author s heavy handed attempts hammer point in tom brokaw correctly recognizes world war ii generation deserving gratitude praise  approach subject commendable  brokaw provides portraits s various participants ranging minorities  women factory workers  famous ordinary  however  brokaw n t let subjects speak  he interrupts narrative make sure reader understands greatest generation  if interested narrative history world war ii opinions clumsily inserted  i highly recommend studs terkel s  the good war   terkel demonstrates incredible sacrifice dedication wwii generation picking gamut participants lets stories convince us indeed generation heroes 
1,here book hailed best seller even released  one fed public america s leading talking heads  tom brokaw  my grandfather normandy later helped liberate several concentration camps throughout germany  what experiences cost  ultimately life  he rarely smiled witnessing horrific brutality  inhumanity set loose world wwii  this book attempt rewrite  already severely inaccurate history period time  brokaw tries attention mass slaughter perpetrated both sides  instead focus heartwarming yet tragic human interest stories common todays evening news  living  greatest generation   killed grandfather s spirit  along millions others like  instead saw living hell  disgrace humanity 
1,what special book  i baby boomer always respected sacrifices wwii generation endure oversees home  do i need tom brokaw reinforce  please  i stopped half way  pages senior citizen complaints younger generations 
4,i purchased cd college assignment generation  i picked perfect book  tom brokaw truly captures entire generation detailed accounts heroic challenges faced  i believe downfall book tom brokaw s voice  as nice sound tv news  seems bit monotone  it started drive nuts several times listening  i guess s i chose purchase book cd i could stop time pick back hour two later  overall  well worth money 
1,the stories people depicted book interesting  ranging really interesting somewhat interesting  these people made difference deserve respect  however book poorly put together  it seems i watching tv show paper  a poor result  would recommend 
4,i agree mr brokaw many points correct saying generation brought change this generation passed innovative legislation  i n t agree s greatest generation perhaps compared recent generations  lest forget generation fought independence civil war  if forget history doomed 
1,tom brokaw knows better  admiring  comments u s veterans  giving much credit american wwii veterans  other raising  good old american image   i see point praising nation profitted wwii  brokaw spend time journalistic adventures  stop hedonist 
1,it amazes book remained atop best seller list long  there absolutely nothing book covered  far descriptive style  host authors  this book another authors help  god needed 
2,although subject matter excellent  stories  editing poor  editing way tape ends middle story uncalled day age brokaw needs understand words beginning x sounded starting  thus  xavier university pronounced  zavier    exavier   for professional  simply unacceptable 
2,i say i ever exprenced  yet younger generation faced clearly far cry peace  this terrorisom us country makes us good contributed efforts wwii  i taken aback brokaw decided godly manor father  fathers friends numro  every generation fair share heros horrible pinpoint generation cover really needed said  lost thousands women cause needed fought  but recent events change outlook wwii  september shown world country generation greatest  we country singled retired folks great job  book failed show real deal glossed much 
2,the copy recieved described  i expecting clean used copy i recieved copy used text book yellow  green highlighter hand written notes margins  i could give gift 
3,as future historian i amazed journalists write book historical topic think giving accurate historical portrayal  when i bought the greatest generation i looking forward reading priceless primary material  i disappointed  the women lived wwii unique qualities seen generations  mean greatest  i think  they made mistakes like every generation  there divorce  spousal abuse  fatherless children  std s  double standards  i respect women fought home front front great deal  truly greatest  no generation truly great  many unique  as americans honor uniqueness  forget generation made share mistakes 
1,it s ironic supposed greatest generation able instill sterling qualities children  much maligned baby boomers  this failure seems expose serious deficiency parenting mentoring skills 
2,big disappointment  i saw brokaw talk shows high hopes the greatest generation  but author s dry  uninspired writing style made reading chore pleasure  i soon found skimming  i recall chapters  as readable subsitute  i recommend similar book studs turkel called  i think  the good war  it told words subjects 
2,the greatest generation might well  the stories compelling diverse  however  mr brokaw s writing style abomination  his prose dry  he trust reader able draw significance irony events descibed  rather compelled tell reader   this significant  this ironic   he holds readers hand rather setting free think lives appreciate beauty  i think bright pink highlighting sentences would annoying  all  great topic  great lives overbearing boring presentation  apparently  mr brokaw content reporter feels necessary remedial reading instructor well
2,the greatest generation pretty good  considering  i mean really expect way literature paid  telegenic  media stars  i enjoyed references howard stern  too bad brokaw n t give stern chapter  the book reminded getting to howard  the odyssey obsessed howard stern fan  now s great book  sort like tolstoy meets dr seuss 
3,it anything away incredible deeds wwii generation say book written anyone brokaw would welcomed  the stories really repetitive  triumph goodness  perseverance etc  the format book real pop culture  surely  people deserve something better thought group short stories 
3,i found idea book interesting  some chapters well written  for part however  put sleep quite often  it n t book i thought would  i loaned book father world war  south pacific  i m anxiously awaiting review book 
2,one short story follows another  the names change  style  lack   message conclusions  i imagine author selected subjects  a poor attempt imitate style brilliance stephen ambrose 
4,i read book finally began understand things dad would never talk concerning  the stories well written thought provoking  the fact people came home best good citizens make good lives without complaining speaks volumes generation  now saw soldiers crying leave families desert storm  do think easier generation wwii  this book shows us  centered   another thing  soldiers came back viet nam desert storm wars blame everything military experience  the wwii generation sucked went lives  they got  makes sort ashamed way generation deals life experiences 
2,tom brokaw  squadron helpers   produced bombastic  windy book disservice superb stories trying tell the book best brokaw lets individuals tell stories  minimum commentary intruding  the peoples  stories poignant  vivid  worth reading the problem  wade brokaw s creaking prose get good stuff  hackneyed phrases loaded superfluous adjectives may sound ok read tom s distinctive voice  read well so  kudos tom getting people tell stories  rotten job trying package 
4,would way describe tom browkaw s collection stories lives generation underappreciated  another way characterize book  however  would say reading  better understanding memorial day holiday  the lives brokaw chronicles us microcosm generation shaped worldth century  as someone limited understanding wwii  i feel i knowledge sacrifices countless women made  the book especially useful giving parents diverse examples human responses adversity  browkaw excellent job making spector become personal us 
2,for gripping stories wwii  read  d day   stephen ambrose  these  close personal  stories grew monotonous  most significantly  brokaw gave short shrift sins  greatest  generations  while i appreciated discussion nation s treatment japanese americans  full treatment generation s rampant racism  sexism post wwii national arrogance missing 
1,brokaw s thesis generation tested   depression   b  wwii  rose challenge deserves respect admiration  this may true  brokaw prove  his book lacks kind rich specificity would convincing  for various people interviews  gives us little survived depression  and book advances  get less less particulars subjects experienced  the problem may many subjects  interviewees  handled thoroughness depth finally convincing  at  left warm feeling survived  grateful  sense finally know  especially past  past shaped    point book 
3,just guy s giving us news years  decades  mean knows century  creative idea  sure  s great way cash millenium  eh 
3,there much bring back memories saying america s greatest generation ruin adding political correctness  he decided write america s sins women  blacks  japanese  etc  this took away original title i began wonder named book  the greatest generation  sell books 
1,i quite disturbed absolute ignorance american reviewers book  they honestly believe america solely responsible allies winning  this book extremely complacent  remarkable bias  qualify history  as last reviewer said  american s obviously think better everybody else  that reason germany started first place 
3,this book great  except tom used many pages emphasize womans role ww  frankly  i could less women ww  besides woman crap  i would suggest everyone read book  understand brave soldiers country 
2,thank you brokaw s generation winning  though without a bomb   sending us korea  vietnam  iraq  iraq  still  afghanistan  necessity  please read mainstream media   you insult us  even generation 
2,i hoped well written well researched book parents  generation  disappointed book neither  it appears written committee  classroom young journalism students  hmmm  asked write   page essay parents  grandparents  trials tribulations great depression wwii  were stories roughly stitched together someones staff  hmmm  sent willing publisher felt  recognition network anchorman would sell almost anything  hmmm       voila  would book  but would n t good book 
3,this book s high low points  some story s sad  dull  overall  give much better appreciation grandparent s generation  they re gone  i feel like i understand little better went great depression wwii it reads fast  easy put back later  thus  good book beach re watching kids  some people debate whether calling  greatest generation  fair  andy rooney  i think chapter brokaw s book best it s neat see    photos subjects 
4,the book favorably received children subject generation  perhaps told elderly mothers fathers wwii generation made physically demanding sacrifices  despite losing close family members  took married daughters children  rented rooms soldiers  wives   worked long beyond middle age  graciously gave comforts due encourage make chaotic existence tolerable rest us 
1,tom brokaw gifted writer  he wrote book dry simple style uses tv audience  the book completely stripped romance soul sake lowest common denominator  i many ww veterans tell stories woven romance heartbreak bring tears eyes  this represented  page biographies common place heroes  pure non fiction uninspiring 
3,when i first began reading book  i could n t put  however  i got book chapters became less detailed less well written  it seemed though author hurried last half book  also latter chapters book  little information provided wartime experiences much given postwar experiences  although i would still recommend book  author would ve provide detail convince  greatest generation   
2,being wwii buff  i heard book i could n t wait get hands  however  shortly reading first stories  i deeply disappointed  i utterly lost respect mr brocaw s journalistic ability  the book simplistic  writtenth grade level   repetitive boring  it feels like article people magazine sort historical record work literature  devoid facts details  contains little anything else the generation writing deserves better tribute  i suppose expected member info tainment industry would write something little substance  i used loyal viewer nbc news  i think i ll switch loyalty jim lehrer pbs 
5,tom brokaw excellent job interviewing capturing impact wwii lives heroes heroines  the experience common bond elevated generation strive greatness lives entire nation  brokaw  drawing vast experience skills newscaster  able extract stories great bravery self responsibility individuals interviewed  he brings sense loyalty  duty  honor  respect self worth  found today s generation 
3,very easy book read author needed longer chapters indivduals profiled fewer people  i came away feeling veterans south dakota made difference  as vietnam vet i interested comparisons author made ww11 vietnam conflict  i feel author trying get present generations thankful ww11 vet makes case indeed  i try seek ww11 vet hometown simply say thank hopefully years tom brokaw write book vietnam generation seek say thank 
2,while people described book certainly interesting  many regular people  like  fine achievements particular attractiveness warrant inclusion  greatest  list  i keep waiting see many  greatest  people    wonder parents  generation better story  least opinion   n t included  short  basic bios  its fair night stand book   fall asleep easily 
2,this book admirable job describing great accomplishments ww generation  many people little preparation became heroes millionaires  but call greatest generation  totally misses point takes make great  it n t great accomplishments  s great values  passing children re gone world better place  look children neglected mothers work  look skyrocketing national debt  look social security debacle  the greatest generation  passed us solve look around tom   major failure 
1,sentimental  shallow book wwii vets  i agree assessment generation  however  read stephen ambrose good wwii books  this book selling author celebrity  duh 
1,shame tom brokaw giving epic title book clumsily written tedious read  i totally underwhelmed lack substance book 
4,i tremendously inspired stories contained book  the american spirit wwii unequalled especially compared sick societies japan germany  whether generation  greatest   doubt mind cooperative effort required defend freedom defeat fascists without doubt greatest effort history 
5,tom brokaw wonderful job book  you really feel people went sacrifices make  my faverite chapter book thomas eileen broderick  thomas paratrooper world war two  he jumped shootout time bullet hit right head  he later found would blind rest life  this many tragic touching stories wonderful book  i recomend go buy book right away 
5,this book nothing i expected  i understand great people today came  tom writes awe people  i know i i read book  this book covers time wwii  you see people writes selling newspapers  building planes  women flying planes  this really feel good book  you away feeling great relatives lived time  this book answered many  why  questions  if lucky enough live close family  give reason many familys close  true family values  you heard many politicians speak  book answer  i n t put finished  i n t like tom  i respect writing ability way presented book 
2,  the greatest generation  reminds biographies printed class reunions interviews published small town newspaper  in  the greatest generation  tom brokaw profiles dozens people served country world war ii most profiles follow template  x  x memory  x married y children  changed x manner  x s family think influenced x  x s friend co worker thinks x great person  x thinks generations follow using formula made easy brokaw three ten page bios people  the profiles seem generic awhile  the book packs little emotional impact perhaps written overly sentimental manner  there interesting stories anecdotes book goes pages i expected something better tom brokaw 
3,i noticed common themes stories brokaw wrote book  these people patriotic  most people grew the depression  they appreciated family survival  they worked hard made something  they endured discrimination yet bitter result  they talk recognized heros  humble accepted awards symbol fought beside  this truly amazing generation  i believe circumstances time influenced become  they paved way next generation  they n t understand younger generations felt slightly removed i n t think made different generation preceded  i glad i opportunity read book  especially since lot gone great reward  god bless 
4,i read book i ve read reviews  the book easy read  it literary breakthrough  good story sometimes forgotten generation  the accusations reader reviewers racism  bias  poor research  poor enunciation surprising  it bad read enjoy book  a tribute fought preserved freedom  i n t expect read factual history  detailed analysis  period i surprised others  i enjoyed stories  point view even parts i found wordy somewhat boring  but  i guess i m tolerant 
4,when i began book  i knew parents  generation  i understand covered thoroughly sacrifices around world war ii  throughout book  i thought uncle  europe japan  i gained greater understanding way members family  friends  parents people public eye behaved  tom brokaw presents compelling picture values fortitude contribute positively fabric society  without pointing differences  demonstrates well lost generation  his words minimal important  he write word need included  the stories spare  draws us lives people presents  i finished book reluctantly  glad i read  filled new understanding wanting  thank goodness sequel 
3,i think premise book great  the generation survived depression fought wwii pivotal generation american history  they saved world tyranny  helped bring civil rights movement  built interstate highway system  built modern education system  quiet dignity grace  they bring us whiny offspring baby boomers  think greatest generation introducing drugs free love  perfect while stories vignettes interesting  i wanted  brokaw never goes depth explore true magnitude people accomplished  this good starter book  appetizer  for main course  i would recommend stephen ambrose  excellent works wwii 
2,this book real sense long general thank letter generation  while flavor appreciation comes across real book i hoping acedemic researched direction  i dissapointed  the generation s deserves book gratitude heaps  though i n t agree quite saints protrayed  not much substance   please historian writer follow idea write proper book 
1,which worse ego partisan views  this guy agenda s almost dumbed representation news  one example whole show going toilet 
1,listen  i like tom brokaw journalist  book obvious pander order sell books  it worked  sold lot copies  by calling wwii generation  greatest generation   gives anyone born within general area idea great  brokaw n t bother make distinction  gi generation   people actually marched  fought  came home  built middle class thrived  and  silent generation  came long little later big conformity s  n t suffer great depression  i n t think re old  re great  author simply would make distinction order sell copies 
2,brokaw writes like veteran newsman  like awestruck  hero worshipping kid  that s crime  expects brokaw s experience training  i felt text shallow  especially final section interviews celebrities  one n t learn lot section  nor get meaningful insights  i felt tremendous  sameness  interviews  surely  people bitter memories less passionately patriotic views  brokaw could presented accurate picture generation including dissenting opinion two  regrettably  wonder accuracy reporting nbc news 
2,i used enjoy tom brokaw nbc anchor critical competent journalist  his book however real disappiontment  for  belonging post war generation  reads shallow  hurra patriotism  story  without ctitical investigation time priode covers  not everything generation great i would expected critical journalist like tom brokaw aspect consideration well  in sense demanding book 
2,an interesting concept containing series stumbling blocks impede reader s progress brokaw path  examples  in dealing womens army corps  wac  united states army air corps  brokaw consistently mis names units  the army air corps not army air force  the wac began waac  womens army auxillary corps converted  necessity waac members sworn army   became womens army corps  brokaw consistently incorrectly refers wacs both text index page book  i wondered editor managed ignore structure sentence page    lieutenent settle spent rest supervising medical technicians hospital difficulties   my flow reading often impeded technical error 
3,not lot  really  hard would compile couple page biographies heroes served ww  
1,  tom   n t quit day job   the greatest generation cliche ridden self servng this book merely platform mr brokaw s ultra left leanings tom never tells us heroes think present  commander chief   
4,tom brokaw tells us words  words others  heroic people grew nothing fought country  the book literary masterpiece  compilation compelling stories real people real struggle   a struggle always results sense pride responsibility n t seem exist today  some book interesting others  brokaw seems politically correct possible  covering every possible race  creed  gender it  final analysis  give reader insight true battles s insight spoiled nature growing lateth century 
3,these wonderful interviews tom brokaw  and give sense pride country  but  the greatest generation   in vietnam  soldiers fighting dark  they n t know fighting  generation  people home  but fought brillantly horrendous circumstances  i friend received  silver stars   bronze stars   purple hearts  leg   commendations  he green beret  he considered hero citizens united states  a wonderful book  tom  but earth  the greatest generation fought nam  it s easy fight right  but easy fight dark  end
2,there touching chapters book  overall  material less than gripping  as i read book  i could imagine text part tv news story script complete old pictures  natural sound  long pauses piece camera pushes pulls shot  coupled video  chapters would powerful  without video  read bit dull side  i n t argue people called greatest generation i would argue claim book greatest tribute greatest generation
1,brokaw delivers lightweight  sketchy  collection interviews world war two vets  unfortunately made lot money spawned equally mediocre sequels there infinite number far superior books covering ground

3,having finished book i found introductory thesis golden dawn  it left wanting the background hermeticism  first part book  best part  it s consise overview western mystical tradition the history gd brief painless new enlightening the overview work gd covers introductory grades brief  if re familiar subject  ll find dull retelling many authors already revealed all told book set  give boiled explanation influential group  but looks many angles  briefly  offer superficial treatment part  this translates superficial appreciation gd readers familiarity subject dissapointed  readers without foreknowledge may wonder s point 
5,  the golden dawn  respected systems magic world  century old  roots long reaching traditions  the essential golden dawn beginner s guide geared newcomers golden dawn  the essential golden dawn written experts topic explores history spirituality tradition  explaining ideas magic magical philosophy exploring teachings basics golden dawn belief system  an outstanding introduction

2,unlike adams  works  provides satire  little humor  the entire purpose book identify cities towns whose names obviously make sense  redefine noun bestow upon nonsensical definition  the reason i n t rate half star  n t offensive  aside   lost 
3,i n t know book existed  what i reviewing predecessor  the meaning liff  that  i say  funny book i ve ever read  it hysterics  even i  unemployed going divorce  it might obvious us readers funny  re familiar stranger place names  quaking houses  example  close i live n e england  shaking houses n t far   consett n t last course meal  s nearby village  why  stars  it s provisional  i m sure reading would result   reasons given 
2,i n t feel s adams  usual standard  good  sniglets    remember  i n t like idea using existing words  usually proper nouns  more imagination needed  and i n t get illustrations

4,this cd highlights boys voice mostly  he angelic voice talented  n t know boy singing  might think girl even adult i hoping cd would boyhood quality  meaning  singing would lots treble  unmistakable boy sound  i hoping i would hear rest choir  rather boy it peaceful cd though  i regret buying 
3,there s lot like angelic voice  in addition  selected songs ethereal might wish   evoking faint images eternity glimpsed comprehended angels singing feet god  dancing heads pins this said  cd   physically delivered s incarnate beings   adequate quality annoyingly overpriced  the mix mundane  dynamic range lacking voices  human instrumental  well localized  overall  product seems something might purchase phone  operator standing  plus shipping handling   for gold plated asking price  requiem   audio vanalstine equipment put test  it wasn t bottom line  likeable stuff indifferent package burdensome price   perfect storm attributes  unfortunately  tends promote illegal file sharing among less scrupulous 
5,i feel sad i n t find boys air choir s cds china but i bought i saw amazon friend s help oh  voices beautiful  in fact  stars really really enough cds  and question i really need help  why n t  cd box set named  angel s music box   it s really beautiful box set  rd album  air   i trust amazon could get 
1,there song cd worth listening  do buy cd  i disappointed cd 
1,i would like blame director   n t preview material  whatever would account awful audio  sound mixing  ms corn s strident  almost lecturing tone reads voice over script  i found remarkably annoying distracting  also  sequencing unique enough get lost practice  speak  i really wanted like dvd  ms corn lovely form provides good demonstration standard poses  nothing novel enough two practices justify keeping dvd collection i find slipping grit my teeth asana i try concentrate music  barely detected behind grating narration  a big disappointment 
1,worst instructional video i ever used  she talks talks talks moves real fast  i extremely difficult time catching next move the video starts minutes advertisement next minutes watching move  you must use remote find  instructional  part  what waste  i wish i could get address let know i never buy anything 
2,i ve done workouts dvd  i enjoyed moves poses  i liked two different workout options     but  honestly  i dread using video i hear lecturing environment  forgiving people   planet s blessings   etc   almost seemed like lesson yoga answer problems  for  i go church i read bible  i really liked idea using dvd good flexibility  etc  i m over the top lecturing  this i find difficult find good yoga dvd  i keep looking 
3,this massive page guide suitable large state california  state many places explore visit it comprehensive description almost every area california excellent maps guides including street maps san francisco  you disappointed book guide  you disappointed lack photographs  a picture worth words book virtually none  so buying book  buy eyewitness travel guides dk  california almost big  pages stunning photos  if buying book  consider frommer guide 
3,book came time ordered  it stains n t mentioned description  basically  used book i got i paid 
3,i enjoyed book  the character compelling mission  around fully developed personae thus fascinating watch  point story ready  goes nowhere  lydia  strong female lead  rejects male attachment  author s point seems soldiering without needing something fill void  however  void  change rise life  addressed  book ends tapering conclusion reminds null poetry innumerable urban wordsmith slams i ve attended  the point point  but need another voice telling us  already death stare us full life  i would read author  appreciated strengths book  find drifting entropic grey area things fence sit 
2,a wonderful past pace western lit  molly gloss give readers plenty time enjoy setting detailed book 
2,this book setting seemed much potential  yet gloss failed give soul characters  i never identified characters cared future  the bad guys evil  heroine heroic  cowboys shallow characterization beyond stereotypes  page page obstacles overcome  yet insights gained  if book n t selection book group  i never would stuck 
3,liked tamogotchi spain lot  did n t like sore head rock n roll much tamogotchi odd tune sounds like band really think  pretty neat thing spain lovely emotional song amazing  sample   sort hoping s  love  thing average first single amazing future we ll wait see suppose 
2,songs opinion cheesey  i like first song  rest   are cheezy 
4,this release new direction blessed  the tracks cd opinion easy listeners  a cd need get away reflect lives relationship christ 
2,i heard cd friend going crazy guy worship christ  she says saw perform years ago awesome  better kirk  deitrick etc  she says michael jackson daincing stuff unique way  i admit worship christ awesome flow meter  i like new direction title song flow weak sounds like bootleg gangsta rapper trying church  i n t know guy wet  i know church i really church  but worship christ made wan get church music  if anybody knows guy music let know  his isnt cd i think call mr kas cash something like 
3,new direction is the choir but for a debut album this cd is ok its not the best but it is ok  some songs like lighthouse  who do you roll with  new direction and worship chirst are good  but the rest of the songs are weak  well i forgot one dance and satified are good to  like i said before this cd is weak and you can buy it if you want to but go and buy their others ones  they are better than this now dont get me wrong this choir is on fire for the lord but i just think that for some songs they could have done better and they have done better  i just dont like this cd 
3,this album loses little steam towards  and despite admittedly talented group  s musical concepts n t already heard elsewhere  having said  could worse add collection  best listened  driving  note  this artist n t confused  new direction   group definitely not gospel 
1,i know i pulled i clicked cutting board  quot  view details  quot  bridal registry    this n t first time happened  
5,they back girl groupx platinum cd  means sold four million copies survivor   man really hesitent buying cd  kinda died whille go  anyways i boughten remix cds happy  example  all saints the remix album  this cd excellent i n t get tracks  my favorite song jumpin jumpin  remix  lil bow wow rox track  also song emotions  remix  great stated play smoothely   butt   its grat dance tune  take advice  trust  i cds  definitly top  go buy kick  butt  cd 
1,in effort tide fans decide hell next move  fact next move  destiny s child taken upon release remix album  what disappointment  while previous two studio records showed occasional flashes musical vocal greatness  album sets back miles  catering every beats to the wall formula saturating radio airwaves process rendering nearly every song futile exercise staccato riffs loud  obnoxious drum programming  only maurice joshua remix so good  music show signs joy life  and michelle williams track tacked strengthens many always believed  williams kelly rowland would wise leave singing beyonce knowles continue roles highly paid background vocalists  nuff said 
3,like cd got songs like remix think destiney child done selves
1,how sad cd released  a supposed  hiatus  yes  they released cash fans  forget  how shoved faces every possible moment  even supposedly taking break  so decide careers  still manage cash cow fans  elsewhere  remixes far anything good  just another sad piece plastic n t worth time day   why n t time  i mean really time  back something good album  after survivor  i hopes disapointing group good  this adds disapointment 
3,their producers had nothing else better to do than but a different tune to their most popular songs do n t get mewrong  i like destiny s child but i do n t like this projectoverall

5,this much thicker material stability ball  feels stable   it worth extra money  i like diagrams exercises around side  i mostly use office chair work  gives ideas gym 
3,i purchasedcm ball use office desk chair  i m     sitting ball feet several inches floor  could n t keep comfortable posture  i returning ordering smallercm ball  also  pump list items included pump  the ball well made  giving three stars since pump included

1,bought play bought  mislead thinking skirt comes straps arent even sewed big piece fabric
1,this odd  in garth brooks success put box set similiar theme  however artists kind treatment n t work falls flat  i like toby keith box set way record company make money buy repackaging three cd s  none good worth  make extra buck  it s sad 
2,when i bought box set  i expected recieve compact discs fully remastered bit technology  instead  sound exactly like original discs i already  while may find several top quality country hits set  sound quality n t snuff today s standards  so i m stuck doubles everything thrity bucks 
2,although cd s fair condition box set came terrible  seperating backing plastic tray holds cd s could least re affixed card 
3,i would enjoyed book i already read the prayer jabez bruce wilkinson  this version lays much information  insights women tucked  the overall message books  valuable   i felt i reading something i already read  however  prayer works  many people discovered  if read books series looking closer walk god  find inspiring information 
4,the beta band s new release album  s experience  from first chords  dry rain  murmers  the house song   listeners capitivated  little perplexed  although inevitable beck comparisons could made  beta band different country pop star  unlike beck  produce sounds  songs certainly n t anything close danceable  yet county folk roots shine  mix rock  roll power chords  making truly enjoyable mix sounds  the lead singer s strong  deep vocals add edge songs  making beta band s u s debut interesting albums year  it s listen  never hear exactly 
3,i bought cd spree n t even know band  i d never seen high fidelity  i sorta like cover  it turned money  dry rain best song  humble opinion  needs listened  it s good cd chill 
2,well  s kind hippy  hoppy  someone learned play slide  suppose beats   sure great big disappointment  music challenging interesting even different  something go background maybe re chemically enhanced  well doors record something else  worth hype  s like low rent version arnold maybe gomez  obviously think cool though  hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm   hubris    
5,the beta band first came notice i saw  high fidelity   being intrigued i first picked soundtrack  disc  this masterful disc  for listeners adventurous  the beta band may  the band shoehorned neat category music degrees today s incarnation pop music given previous high marks granted disc   the three e p  s  could set big fall opinion  happily proved case  this disc become heavily played discs remain long time  personal favorites  dry the rain     she s the one     needles in my eyes   i must musically adventurous 
4,while listen ep found music discover new way reborn  this guys made original fascinating mixture diferent sounds influences kind  just waiting album  keep good work  
3,i like self titled album better  some really good stuff  particularlythe first tracks  questionable stuff well 
5,the beta band good beach boys love  rockets 
3,ok  i admit  dry rain  big reasons i bought cd  songs like  house song    dogs got bone  pretty good well  however  instrumental stuff  like  monolith   n t grab  yet  though i see growing time  the variety  mostly  mellowness cd makes well worth price
4, meddle  atom heart mother  pink floyd  that s bad thing   s good thing  i say meddle   later stuff   v e r y atmospheric  v e r y psychedelic  oh  i know  s probably neither things lot  s my collection  and s probably reference people relate obscure british bands lot people never heard  hey  i like cd  but i n t find groundbreaking  it s simply tilling ground n t harvested 
5,beck meets stones    party starts    time everyone s feeling comfortable cocktails    primal scream drops righteous time  beg borrow steal  beta band rocks originality originality early brethen  probally sound good garage album 
5,if think today s young musicians make hardcore  ska  punk kind noises  must change mind right  listen record  made four art students  it s delicate  involving  vibrant  time  the first e p    champion versions   sublime best  third   los amigos beta bandidos   excellent  second   the patty pattty sound   less inspirated two  pretty good  in opinion  highlights  dry rain     b a    it s over   
4,feel guilty listening  due fact short hair  s great stuff  beta band succeeded setting wild rumblings baked mind music   actually understood last sentence  ll love album     
5,how say small  underappreciated  terrific band done disservice music disseminated fairly good movie soundtrack  dry rain happens great song n t necessarily vein monolith  good representation band nonetheless  after  band wrote  recorded  made a side first ep  so cares latest albums spacey  less poppy  the fact matter  output  including dry rain  amazing interesting innovative  to whoever reading review   buy everything find the beta band  s worth  and n t listen seem think music esoteric initiated dry rain  i bet good deal fans wound loving crazy stuff band offer much popcraft 
1,this review people possibly looking beta band single high fidelity soundtrack  drying rain great song  unfortunately formula makes great song carry rest album  it really bunch noise  main stream music fans pass stick soundtrack  trust me 
2,this cd n t bad like repetitive lyrical phrases without meaning  looping samples  speech repeats says nothing  like  pushin     i perceive talent somewhere  group making music cds mostly lack music  where s music  some songs start  seem potential develop something  n t  now  said  worthwhile cuts  couple quite good  so ultimately  like music incoherent mixes various sounds  simply decide whether re willing pay     cut i ll admit  maybe i n t get  find place sample everything album i think ll find i m vindicated

3,this first bike rack  chose based customer reviews reputation saris  i liked put car  s solid strap system secure  mounting rack onto car straightforward  but   took forever get  bikes  the mounts close together pedals jamming wheels  handlebars jamming seats  etc  one bikes child bike  n t  i m convinced would able mount three  i suspect common problem  it would helpful mounting instructions included tips positioning things we dented back trunk first time used rack  since  ve positioned lower pushes fender  trouble  but  note instructions would nice

2,this rack sturdy long worked  i bought rack  months ago  i mounted car time  there thin hard plastic ring thin lip goes inside cylinder protect nylon ties rubbing tearing edge cylinder  sharp  so today plastic ring cracked  probably temperature drops last dayss week  two main nylon ties  clips back trunk lid car  tore cutting along edge cylinder  so i think design flaw  either plastic ring could thicker edges ridged cylinder could smoother razor sharp 
4,i love everything saris bones  especially bright red matches car   except metal clamps clip onto trunk  points  there s bound better way keep scratching paint solution wrapping saran wrap  otherwise  s easy mount  holds bikes securely  mention matches car perfectly 
4,this good people looking great rack use bikes  it fitts great car  one problom s pain put bikes  n t fit three inch bmx bikes well thought would fight put little elbow greese  but it s good 
2,the reviews amazon made decide buy bike rack i  obviously over rated product the extending arms hold bike thick especially towards make hard fit bike properly i full suspension bike even though i bought extra bar go seat handlebars  easy put definitely n t feel safe  bike hanging seat fixed part   the seat post strap nice feature cumbersome as far plastic  s good material rack softer bike case bang n t damage bike after using weeks i found easier put bike reverse seat post strap towards lower bar 
3,bike rack ok n t tell front unsteadymph  i bikes rocking back forth like crazy i added  extra heavy duty tie straps since i driving half way across country two week trip  if going use around town ok i would recommend interstate driving unless rig extra straps

3,i looking title dvd many years  this favorite early youth  this say i fan opera i believe jesus born decemberth  as i expected  appears simple  vhs dvd transfer  the original video recording apparently captured canned as is  say  studio overdubbing  therefore  lyrics often hard understand  just  i overjoyed rare seasonal production  if liked title child  nothing different  except maybe hearing   you still like today 
5,this film asked residents  assisted living nursing home   it favorite past classic  shown tv  longer seems make christmas movies  the discussion group followed  wonderful  it really triggered many memories viewers

5,a spell binding book  one stop reading  sometimes start believing  magic could real  i felt jessex kirith kirin throughout hole book  one hopes win great together day happy untroubeld  i wish arthen would real i could go day become young  i m waiting sequel 
4,fans author mercedes lackey s novels heralds valdemar sure enjoy jim grimsley s  kirith kirin   after reading grimsley s haunting beautiful novel  dream boy   i intrigued see writer would handle fantasy genre piece  grimsley really delivers   tome filled enchanting visions world magic revered  little understood except adept art  do n t let hundreds pages fine print scare   excellent map  glossary  appendices make world portrayed life 
3,let s  contriving entire fantasy world like tolkien leiber storm constantine whit middle earth  nehwon wraeththtu world n t easy  jim grimsley results indoing uneven  great athmosphere  beautiful evocative scenes  like jessex abandoned city   many places reader feels like s swimming molasses the general background n t clear  go appendix see which and premise story n t much plausible  opinion  even fantasy world  but really annoyed absurdly unsightly uneuphonious names author chose places things  shenesoeniis  chalianthrothe  gnemorra  curaeth curaesyn   their quoyness  see douglas adams  meaning liff  another  marginal  flaw book  o elbereth gilthoniel 
3,kirith krirnjim grimsleythis fantasy story concerning young boy become next wizard northern kingdoms  the prince king fall love adventures  the plot moves slowly attention many details obviously connected story line  unlike robert jordan  however  grimsley overdo language culture  much link history culture  also n t monsters brace enemies  there drugaen keefax jessex struggles  one apparent thing missing drugaen turned shadow  also queen arthryn allow bring shadow southern kingdom 
2,you d think year old faced salvation immortal king  keystone army thousands integral future entire world would overwhelmed  frightened  excited  disbelieving  awe  jessex  protaganist novel wooden perfect  and oh  ever perfect  jessex none frailty humanity ve expect even cheapest dime store fantasy novels  as result  book near complete loss   i truly pity kirith kirin  facing prospect several lifetimes someone completely uninteresting 
3,i enjoy story line movies scenery pretty  the music enjoyable costumes neat classical 
3,  connecticut yankee  favorite films  s pity transfer poor quality i find curious bundled another film  is  connecticut yankee  enough  i honestly interest film plus  although film must  s bit pricey   
2,this dvd hard find  unfortunately poor quality  the picture fuzzy  however  enjoyed movie  enjoy better comes along
4,my son in law could believe seen movie bought vacation time together  it interesting  exactly expected fun 
4,i love movie glad finally came dvd  the emperor waltz added bonus i got first movie 
4,well title says   emporer waltz  favorite movies i kid   mainly poodle  i crazy dogs i kid dogs play pretty large part movie  i ll admit plot script wise little weak  still pretty good  and i really n t even like bing crosby  i listened things pretty funny  i think i seen   i could remebering  the court jester  somewhat similiar too either way watch funny movies s s n t seen million times i would reccomend  p s  it little confusing though way set dvd   i think movies different sides disc  options main menus   oh well  needs investigating 
2,this review  connecticut yankee   this movie enjoyable even musical  but s big problem  s  bing crosby goes beautiful lady betrothed someone else  why could n t beautiful lady  taken  storyline  this movie reminds  titanic  james cameron  kate winslet marry someone else goes leonardo dicaprio without breaking engagement first  would right thing  a lot people think s nothing wrong behavior  i would love keep movie collection   lacks class 
4,i bought movie i wanted see a connecticut yankee king arthur s court  i n t seen since i boy i remembered really enjoying  but i never seen the emperor waltz  both movies classic bing movies  sauv ladies sings way girls  hearts  i actually found enjoying the emperor waltz better yankee  it n t nearly silly yankee quite romantic  if like bing movies i d definitely give try 
2,tell truth  n t like book  whole  western  books  read project school thought terrible  plain simple  sorry liked guys r weird 
3,i hoping shabby chic design  fun browse thru get ideas 
4,this book bad  useful information  nice photos  i ve found little dated  however still helpful create little cottage retreat get inspiration looking pictures too i still little disappointed i ve received book  probably i expecting up to date photos  i ve seen better picture books cottage style  i think book still growing   i got use though 
2,i generally enjoy watching old movies  good ones  while hitchcock managed decent movies  i think largely overrated the story thin  attempted humor annoying funny  peter lorre   general writing bad acting great  our spies getting credit job couldn t did n t even  pathetic whole setup makes usa look foolish incompetent  in fact  i think movie watching  i dislike it i recommend movie anyone  sorry 
2,this story modicum drama except small  surprising given starry nature human cast   close nonexistence suspense  muddy sound recording compounded hard understand dialog  english accents   gielgud s performance hero mostly dimensional  understand delivery   heroine  carroll s  acting  ranges chatty zombie  lorrie s delivery over the top   quite frankly  embarrassment  portrays  good guy  killer  all marked contrast achievements fourth principal performer  robert young  young provides acting tour force subject matter film  he makes film  there gee wiz  time   special in camera editing effects fast becoming  would continue  hitchcock trademark not hitchcock s masterpieces  disasters either william flanigan  ph d
3,here hitch movie that although great  hard watch  i think perhaps plot explores peoples fasination killing person  to begin carrol s character ready kill  she thinks would make high old time  gielgud s character knows  though even orders s country murder n t pretty thing live with the movie starts think s dead soon find government faked death cover job  he carrol  as well lorre  track spy away him it really great movie  n t mood think save  but definatly check    
3,interesting story  hitchcock touch evented  madeleine carroll standout  buy john gielgud lead 
3,during ww1  edgar brodie assume false identitiy go secret mission switzerland  i liked film way hitchcock builds suspense viewer climax incident langen alp  the carachter brodie  go misson although n t much espionage  really cold situations  interesting  along general elsa  although later work much better ways charachters effects good film  i would recomend hitchcock fans  anyone enjoys good film 
1,warning  warning  warning  the transfer quality dvd  secret agent  discusting  thisst century  digital age  with latest transfer machines market excuses studio s churning rotten transfers  before buy disc  ask unwatchable image  good old  hitch  would turn grave knew happening precious movies  a warning posted rotten transfer disc i done  do n t buy it  demand better quality 
2,only fans hitch  very dated today s audience  slow pace confusing character development  especially peter lorre s  general   stiff portrayals surprising lack suspense  where s macguffin need 
3,i say  i n t really enjoy movie  i would recommend renting considering purchasing it i found little chemistry gielgud carrol  peter lorre seems determined steal every scene  the story bit thin well 
5,for late saturday nights  watch good classic thriller family  really nothing compare good alfred hitchcock movie  in secret agent  young soldier summoned superiors  finds listed newspapers killed action  john gielgud excellent role  complimented lovely madeleine carroll  thrill seeking agent stars  wife   robert young  known roles musicals crime dramas  plays part american   third  movie  invoking passing interest carroll  the plot twists turns well worked  whole movie worth watching  peter lorre especially best  bloodthirsty spanish agent working gielgud carroll  if fan hitchcock films  i would recommend add movie collection 
1,i sure let amazon members know dvd would play dvd player  i purchased three hitchcock films distributor three dvds actually played  this n t  buyer beware 
5,three best stereolab albums  cheap  n t go wrong  buy  listen first track mars audiac quintet   three dee melodie   this pop finest

1,sheena easton terrible mistake history music industry  how woman ever get signed  do n t buy cd  s gross s pop bad genre music  this whole cd bad example bad genre first  s songs  songs cool singer good  but sheena bad  this cd songs torture regret  regret ever putting cd cd player  her voice weak  the songs upbeat poppy  voice  sound weird  she s good pop  and s even worse ballads  she s bad everything  she s total madonna wannabe please  please  please n t purchase cd  it s waste money  buy something good  not sheena easton 
3,overall good product  what see get  they pretty small though  smaller i thought would 
3,i thought book enjoyable read  say  decent book read park nice afternoon  nothing intense  it little slow middle  still enough interesting stories keep reader going find happened young woman  it picked pace toward  almost putting much  intense reunion father  graduating harvard  plenty wrestling team metaphors growing self realizations  within last chapters  compared books i ve read  would n t  star n t particularly life altering  funny  witty original  a well roundedst novel summer though

4,terrific movie experiment works ways  a gorgeous girl always things going way loses athletic scholarship college gets injures and way could pay  to earn money  enters contest disguises fat girl goes undercover another school  she soon learns cruel people severely obese people especially high school  fans the big bang theory love seeing kaley cuoco  penny   limited amount dvd extras 
4,although film tough watch  s pretty honest people treated differently presented less perfect package  we unique kind  sometimes differences become stumbling blocks meet less tolerant people  some best people world oftentimes overlooked  shunned  mistreated look  nobody makes rules speak  peers usually dictate accepted popular given time  many times i wondered different world would viewed inside  our differences make us unique  less be while film easy watch times  viewed students day time bullying separation  certainly good study might time see differences influence relationships great way let

3,since first edition  lot answers solutions manual wrong  if student brink understanding topic book gives him her wrong answer  n t build much confidence 
1,i taking calculus book  i n t know people survived calculus book  this book someone really grasp calculus  beginners  the examples n t match problems  re thoroughly confused nothing look help re homework  you get headache literally trying understand  calculus hard enough authors make harder learn needs  i ve calculus books explain much better thorough examples i could understand keep  this book poor job 
5,book exactly i wanted significantly cheaper school book store   cheaper   it looks brand new  user said  like new   came fast  i took ap calculus jr year high school  i repeating course freshman university  i qualified level math calc ii  decided math  calculus i university  the material looks challenging  since i took ap stats senior year  i ve forgotten bit calculus  i good calculus teacher feel confident i well class since i earned hard a youngest student  yrs old  taking course high school 
3,like i said  went crazy functions instances explain well enough material  summed meaning simple basis study calculus i enjoyed learning slick tricks 
3,i used book calc class interesting noble approach changing way calculus taught today  lacks ability explain things student s level  it great text someone already knows calculus  get concepts alternative light  however  students little calculus experience  prepare lost pray hepful professor 
1,this third calculus book i ve  i n t understood  in others i could always follow examples relate homework questions  in book example problems nothing homework questions  i imagine good calculus teacher would less problem basically book taught nothing hate calculus 
4,after checking library  i found  goodbye  columbus  good enough purchase personal collection  what riot book parts  i class college read parts  show chauvinist roth   i really n t get impression i read entire novel and scene ron listening graduation album cracked up do n t remember enough short stories comment authority  i ll leave alone 
4,goodbye columbus book centering around young lustful relationship problems arise due differences social class religion  it easy read good choice someone wants read something entertaining  it best mature readers mind sexual theme 
3,this book certainly good  s story poor guy affair rich girl  great time together break  their relation weird typical ridiculous couple  maybe old enough stuff  neil lives aunt gladys uncle max newark  brenda lives short hills  rich neighborhood  he falls love brenda  summer sex party sessions every day brenda s home  finally re discovered brenda s parents  they discovered brenda  forgot  diaphragm room mother found  however neil finds brenda made things happen  could break 
1,i guess somebody scanned paper version book build kindle edition  appears filled ocr errors the content writing enjoyable  kindle edition typos real buzzkill getting book get paperback  skip kindle edition 
3,it excelent story everyone even young readers  it stories applies everyone everywhere  a must read  highly recomended  the bit predictable still good book 
3,goodbye columbus really good book  matter award winning story  lack characterization main character makes book failed attempt feeling sympathetic  this story summer love  protagonist  neil klugman kid mets brenda patimkin  girl upper class falls love  neil always making fun social class  sometimes even mean  for reason  reader never like  the setting novel great  flaw protagonist attitude good  begin read novel  expectations high  dissapoints 
2,i would n t recommend book   i believe roth involved characters sex trying get sort plot going   i n t enjoy reading goodbye  columbus  i enjoy reading short stories sex rather religion  thank short stories   
1,i read book college class  i expected  i liked  defender jews  main novella   goodbye columbus   
1,the movie infatuated sub literate  reviews  adaptation immediately turned  probably ingest audio format  the amazon no name misspelled harlan ellison s didnt help  s vastly better writer roth  reason i going buy tapes  guess 
1,while ross excellent writer i hate leave review nit picks format rather content  i think s useful considering buying kindle edition warned digital text numerous obvious copy errors  seemingly created scanning book   candles  become  candies     corn  becomes     etc  throughout book  it s usually easy work word  s distracting breaks flow text 
4,no doubt philip roth talented courageous writers  too bad kindle edition riddled typos distract power prose 
2,sadly  kindle edition replete typos  seemingly un proofread ocr translation  a truly great book  completely unreadable  too bad roth s publisher n t available itunes store  
3,it earlys i library woodbridge middle school  i found hardcover book seemed interesting  a time travel story  being science fiction i  course  checked  i enjoyed much i remembered day  in fact  i order i found amazon  of course i forgotten title  author  almost everything lucky find site prehistoric fiction  but lets move onto plot yes  plot simple  days sending teens back time norm  teenagers sci fi fought aliens  destroyed monsters saved world time  sometimes once sadly  science  mostly early life  outdated  well  duh  first printed  of course dinosaurs behavior wrong  but i think would still make good gift child starting read explore books  or person wants  like  relive moments childhood 
2,science far i hard time believing thought accurate  dinosaurs whose behavior maniacal attack  even case herbovores  prehistoric operate pretty much level  savages got savage   a paleontologist travels back time dinosaur collects data  mostly shoots things  only female character  mostly happy something please male heros  people make bizarre choices apparantly plot needs  no character development  clumsy writing  sloppy editting actually  lester del rey n t even write  someone else wrote outline there good science fiction written  probably example science fiction used crummy reputation 
3,this movie average stuff imho  the movie spongebob patrick traveling forbidden shell city  place animal ever returned  retrieve king neptune s crown plankton stolen evil plan z  there couple funny moments like spongebob gets drunk eating many goofy goober sundaes  fish county line  but i n t think things really anything movie funny  offence   also  spongebob drives hamburger destination  pretty cool   a sponge driving hamburger  puh  also  humor movie  made double dissapointment 
5,my seven year old loves movie  now watch whenever likes  happy 
3,the reason i m rating  stars cause movie n t coming nov th   i really wan see  i love previews   bigger  squarier  spongier   it s random came  sounds sooooooooooooooooooo convincing  please good sound

3,the spongebob squarepants movie  widescreen edition   alec baldwin good series  however  movie great funny  sure moments like spongebob gets  drunk  ice cream garry falls love mermaid  thug bar   still story feels rushed well developed charachters much bigger part series basically get air time  the kings daughter annoying i find pc move looses edge show movie completely lacking  still movie gets three stars rightly deserves

2,i n t know m rating spong bob movie  let say complete disappointment  boring  remember exactly supposed  kids cartoon  anime late night airing  buy kids  adult fan  skip buying  renting  realy n t need watch sponge bob  grow   
3,this movie okay  i thought could lot better  i slightly disappointed film n t contain many laughs usually show  i enthusiastic fan   squidward hardly even included movie  i somewhat irritated  goofy goober  song featured part movie  on positive side  however  plot entertaining  characters likable  fairly interesting element unanimated world mixed animated world  for reasons  i would give spongebob squarepants movie three stars 
5,i n t sure think  sitting theater  boys  husband  i knew alot children theater  i never imagined i would hear much adult laughter outside  i spongebob fan since came knew i would like least couple things   i laughed hard   what great movie  i think movie people ages  when little older seem really appreciate hilarity put spongebob  patrick s characters  how bust every time hear spongebob tell plankton     well  good luck   it absolutely wonderful character  my husband     two biggest fans house  what hoot  this movie  well  rocks

5,i get son he huge spongebob fan  i admit  i  after seeing nickelodeon  wanted watch  
1,why  why  why always shows i hate much world storm   rocko s modern life lot better spongebob  i n t believe even lied rocko making appearance movie  for spongebob fans  boycott spongebob now  rocko is better 
5,i m huge fan show i see movie  this movie unbelievably hilarious  if re adult wants go see funny movie re rated r kids home n t go go  i know people n t seen like   right  this movie looks like s kids   well think  most jokes movie very hidden teens adults catch  goofy goober nut bar scene   and kids laugh occasional fart jokes  and give heads up funny part read n t read stop reading here when spongebob sings  goofy goober rock  song watch s screaming microphone krusty krab floor mind slaves walking toward look s  so funny
2,i really like watching mins spongebob squarepants episodes tv  re innocent happy  i watched movie i almost lost head awful  this actually  longest boring spongebob episode ever   critics chile said i totally agree them the worst thing producers could include real people stupid effects make laugh movie  like david hasselhoff  made fun acting     plus  stupid effect starts acting boat something  i self shame i watched part      i think worst thing could buy dvd  ll watch  ll hate ll waste bucks  bad purchase 
2,here comes  the big movie hilarious tv series  s the spongbob squarepants movie  spongbob patrick mission save king neptunne s crown  travel long long way  despite two stars  move s moments laugh giggle  but movie lost essance series  it n t funny spongebob icon goody goodness fun  but movie huge letdown sequel imrpove series the funny moments patrick falls love mermaid   i think cyndi   s like your pretty   same old patrick  character stays consistent movie worth rent  some crude humor weird images 
1,full screen edition dvds suck  unless it was filmed way   full screen crops theatrical picture   ratio shape standard  non widescreen  tv screen  there letterboxing  third original picture lost  widescreen preserves original theatrical picture ratio film appear  letterboxed  format normal tv screen  if movie going modified s original version it cost much 
5,everyone s concerned s  crude humor   you n t think kids ever hear stuff  turn tv right  flick channels like fox  mtv  vh1  you n t think kids ever stop watch  if n t like movie you could make kids bored making watch beauty beast  or barbie s adventure happy land  i could notice tons sexual references  just know best family oriented movie ever  and rare days  there totally clean mickey mouse short anymore i think instead kids growing quick  i think parents adapting changes world slower 
4,i m  not memeber target audience  favourite films include south park  team america ali g reason spongebob always seems make laugh anyway funny film even childish good funny scenes likepatrick flag inbetween a  cheekswhen got drunk ice creamgoffy goober rock songand much s funny spongebob  along kenan kel rugrats kimi dil joined  show nickelodeon i watch say i like  fairly odd parents s t  yu gi oh s t  all grown up s t  mr bean animated s t r rest

2,i ll admit  i m spongebob junkie  i ve seen almost episodes  multiple times  i saw movie came theatres fellow spongebob freak  gosh  like even care that said  i movie  the writers make great minute episodes  apparently nothing good comes trying make longer plots  it disturbing parts younger kids  i n t even let niece watch comes tv  she s big fan episodes well all  stick original shows 
5,this cartoon worse tv show kids nickelodeon tv shows nowadays lacking disney channel always have new episode every day back days way kids n t lose interest  nowadays always show episode new episode week
3,i m spongebob fan since day  i actually excited movie released  but film proved little disappointing  the movie starts great  like lot movies  begins loose steam  it really feel like episode tv stretched movie length  the sad thing episodes spongebob funnier entertaining movie  how long search king s crown last gets repetitive little dull  i would recommend film younger fans  older fans may find plot suspenseful enough actually keep interest  spongebob better minute episode show nickelodeon 
5,my i thoroughly enjoyed feature length movie  lots lots laughs 
3,this spongebob movie crazy it sure lots imagination  grand kids love  i think aimed towards children butthen depends like definitely fantasy  never know crazy thing going happen next 
2,i like spongebob  though quite much kids  this enjoyable  exceptional dvd  around measure dvd encore factor  if n t play hell  n t   does n t explain el dorado  gets played far often deserves   it n t played second time  even  year old watches sb every day  i would n t waste cash  ll get enjoyment endless re runs play nick

4,this album muddy waters released  it basically released capitalize folk blues revivals  hence title   the songs consist random assortment songs previously album  the songs recorded  album n t really uniform sound  the older tracks pretty worn scratchy sounding  despite audio shortcomings cd  lot classic performances  if find cheap copy cd  worth picking

3,i read book cover to cover  eager find i could ancestor samual adams  this unedited version tedious read due s many spelling errors interruptive footnotes middle paragraphs  i would interested read edited version ever published  needs reformatted kindle readers  the content factual interesting 
2,i tried similar products past  n t satisfied  after reading excellent reviews  gave try  i disappointed  even though comes precut shapes cold wax  good job eybrows  it left lot hairs  the shape precut wax strips n t good neither  n t match eybrows well  my conclusion far experience home wax products nothing good job get salon 
1,these strips nothing scotch tape shape eyebrow removers  they may two hairs  n t close supposed 
1,hair off instant eyebrow shapers cold wax strips  s n t really work i buying brand anymore
1,they n t work    it pulls hair  n t   maybe works different people  work 
2,this product live claim  it n t work  it barely takes hair eyebrows

5,really works convenient  i n t go salon anymore  the cold wax effective hot wax 
1,i purchased product last week discovered garbage  the strips shape terrible remove hair  complete waste      
1,this product n t work well i hoped  it n t hurt  n t remove hair  i go behind pluck eyebrows  even longer hairs picked strips   save money buy wax instead 
5,product disappeared store shelves  glad find online  very quick easy use 
1,you might well wax eyebrows duct tape  cheaper produce results product  this stuff pulls much skin hair  beware 
3,these best quickly removing tiny hairs super annoying  impossible pluck tweezers  while n t get every hair  might area twice get missed hairs   much cheaper alternative pricy salon  my main gripe leave impossible amount residue taken special oil  like azulene   overall  shabby price 
2,i guess i guilty high expectation  maybe stubborn hair  either way i impressed  i still tweeze using strips  i made initial mistake trying use stipps repeatedly area strips n t get first time   big mistake  i ll use overall  tweezing still necessary maybe i n t hold mouth right  
1,it work  or i used wrong  anyway i threw away whole box  waste money 
2,i bought hopes getting nicely diy shaped eyebrows avoiding hassle spending  every  weeks get eyebrows painfully waxed  i followed instructions oil dirt free i tested product  everything going great i pulled strips  they n t work  the strip pulled hair remove  i n t think sticky enough i n t press hard enough stick completely  on bright side  cheap i purchased

1,i went reviews  n t  boys  triplets  wanted bad i bought  them  they n t even looked since x mas   the fell apart everything written  true  next time make sure decsion based reviews  what waste money   time purchase  anyway would reccomend toy 
2,i living england first came i thought pretty fun catchy fit well surroundings  but unimaginative beats  rote guitar solos liam s incessant whine started grate   slide away  still excellent tune  rest   blah 
5,definitely maybe shows the beatles missing  gutsiness give whole world vs  kicking rip roaring rock n  roll star ending lullaby married with children  album certainly best thing oasis ever produced  never mind hype acclaim came morning glory  could never match extra punch definitely maybe packs  live forever slide away album s highlights n t curious bad s first three albums  best song n t released single  slide away  champagne supernova fade in out  i ll bet gas panic  n t single 
5,i n t get oasis latter parts  i readily imagine revolutionary debut sounded british audiences first came  combining pummeling guitar surge melodicism beatles psychedelic sensibilities stone roses   definitely maybe  still sounds like world beater  from britpop touchstone  shakermaker  riff monster  supersonic  melancholy yet anthemic  slide away   every track era defining classic  simply put  landmark british debut albums time 
5,definitely maybe ranks alongside sgt  pepper  concept   murmur  college radio  alternative   nevermind  grunge   too far care  country  truly seminal works rock roll  this album single handedly resurrected brit pop stimulated interest genre dire need jolt energy in terms debut  almost nothing compares brilliance definitely maybe  amazing lyrics  otherworldly guitar noel  best chops rock liam  culimating incredible  slide away   if cd s  must 
1,hell   loosers enlgand trying copy beatles  mean even fans stuipid  read review oasis fans criticized thebeatles rip oasis  hello dude beatles oasis  enough skip album get hte better clones the beatles r i p  john lennon  george harrisonthey must be turning in there graves
5,first sometimes became best  if must choose  bands  brit music  oasis must list  best band  second best the verve stand top  columbia best song forever oasis made  really believe song guitar chords power bring us side time tunel  if love album  n t try best album   a storm heaven the verve 
5,oasis bands captures essences maintaining style  this sets apart others n t quite make  noel writes greatest lyrics around  liam sings fashion grips listener makes em  the band good 
3,the hype band incredible  i always thought great bands pushed musical envelope back adding new elements musical landscape  oasis add nothing  far innovative  music cd derivative oh cliched  if marketing ploy reach lowest common denominator  succeeded admirably  i m afraid form music created dad rock  i say granddad rock 
5,i cant tell album makes appealing  if anyone put thier finger undefineable attraction musical masterpiece deserve round duck  full exceptional songs  front runner album s  rock n  roll star great opener followed shakermaker  real piece psycadelica  other tracks prominent supersonic  oasis  first single  cigarettes alcohol  others up sky digsy s dinner high standard  contrary popular belief  slide away weakest track lot  a must self respecting music conneseur  amazing 
4,although i like certain songs later albums  oasis shines debut  definitely maybe   many songs album rock  alternative feel  there s energy oasis n t quite match s latter efforts  songs like  rock n  roll star     slide away     columbia    live forever  catchy  pop rock anthems ll find album  this would pick definitive oasis album 
4,n t like oasis  brand pretty petulance annoys reasons honestly n t explain  ve proudly dismissed popularity remained faithfully fan  instead  many brit pop acts attention dollars  supergrass  suede  super furry animals  radiohead  few the oasis behind music  vh1 made references raw  energy packed  definitely maybe   possibly got tired disliking  went  wearing good disguise  bought album thankfully  hoped would  powerful bold attitude  strong songwriting catchy hooks  little pretty petulance  ve disliked everything else ve heard hearing  definitely maybe   so  oasis non believers  recommend  oasis die hards yet hear  careful  might scare bit  s certainly wimpy probably beat 
3,i not oasis fan  i bought album back came  desired newer albums  liam s voice turn off  style britpop favorite  but  supersonic   marvelously catchy pop tune   bring it on down   injects much needed punk energy stew   digsy s diner  happily s esqe tune  rest seem mired guitar slop repetition  i appreciate album s rawness  seems absent subsequent releases 
5,there lot say  mates this best debut albums ever rocknroll star good song  i fooking like live forever  opinion demo versionof song better supersonic  fooking good  too all lads manchestermade fooking good album cheers  stevie
5,wow  i first heard album  changed outlook music forever  the rocking melodies lyrics album make good  this album rivals be here now s greatness  oasis are the best       
4,want rock n roll night party every day  then album must stereo  and even though lyrics  digsy s dinner  pretty silly  catchy tune grow 
5,slide away  supersonic  live forever best songs ever  s suprising  since oasis best bands world  i mean  noel genius  liam s voice beautiful bonehead  whitey guigsy amazing  if buy cd  re gon best time life 
2,on basis critical raves album  i bought see fuss oasis  i came away surprised album garnered rave reviews  this basically s plagiarism combined snotty johnny rotten attitude  complete sneering  nasally whining lead singer  this gets pretty old fast  yes  i know oasis exploded popularity since first album  yes  i know critics seem love  sorry  impressed  oh  way  band members shamefully cocky  insufferable jerks 
4,i recently bought oasis s definitely maybe album dual cd  side cd album side dvd  the dvd stuff pretty cool hilarious times  especially crazy british guy  keeps flipping out interviews  definitely maybe great album  know   i always problem recording quality  the album sounds muffled  i n t believe recordings early s already sound bit primitive days  even though cd s  i began notice lot albums early mid s  although  i think definitely maybe recorder style techniques makes sound even muffled  oh well  s still great album definitely oasis s best 
1,this obscenely derivative album basically amounts talented people revamping mrs gallagher s record collection passing  if d american  maybe someone would called lawyers done away formulaic  monotone drivel i would suggest go back search box look original artists instead  t rex  the new seekers  course  the beatles  also recommended r e m s the wake up bomb  derides nicely 
1,loved  whats story   recently  got cd  i cant believe band  dm boring whiny i hardly listen way   whats story   much inspired less nasaly  im glad i didnt hear first i never would gottennd  music isnt good either
1,this overrated album   live forever  however song must ignored  it probably oasis s best songs date   slide away    married children  decent far amazing  i suggest buy single 
1,the lp definitely maybe  and its evident success  is a symbol of the culture of mediocrity which enswathes british culture  it is but one example of the fall of the united kingdom from greatness to laughing stock 
2,hell americans  cant like good music   band awful  theres good song s anthemic live forever  closest got decent tune  every song idiotic  bash head repeated riff rock n t ever compared beatles ever  gallagher brothers crap  attitude  look songs  crappp  morning glory good album admit  reason people    accept move
3,ok the songs bad measure lead singer sings quietly opinion songs lack metal quality in ex  if enjoy purely medieval music buy cd but groundbreaking  breathtaking rock medieval music fusion listen best group  best humble opinion   in extremo   
4,a perfect blend medieval ren faire hard soft music  ditto reviews  thank goodness i listen i pod otherwise cd might thrashed  on live warriors 
3,they bill themselfes  rolling stones middle ages   like motley crue  definitely celtic  high energy thrashing  beautiful  you ve got like hard get  i couple albums listen occasionaly  for something lighter  try  faun   
3,uk records singles collection compilation cc contains singles released  cc s sound mix pop  rock  art rock soft rock  the booklet contains sleeves singles linernotes written mark brennan  the compilation uneven good tracks  waterfall    carat man means     wall street shuffle   the earlier tracks sound silly first i thought song  donna  parody     
5,i year old  year old  the year old n t open   year old enough trouble adventure n t worth  so icky goodies stay house 
1,after i saw guys conan o  brien   i could help think  what rip   guys trying new  raw simple rock  many bands  white stripes  the strokes   this affirms whole belief time live   if popular   see  
3,they re certain hate  akron s the black keys going compared the white stripes  which shorthand  re combo adores blues  on the big come up  guitarist vocalist david auerbach drummer patrick carney sound like stepped mississippi delta listening john lee hooker  vibe   creedence clearwater revival  structure   jimi hendrix  vocals i d      dj shadow  rhythms   in rock season everything old new  remains seen whether twosome produces work hold blues canon  yet never seem inauthentic retro leanings  sincerity counts lot basics  in five years time  the big come up might sound good great blues joint seems old hills immediate tomorrow s news 
4,butt shaking music  if like bluesy rock ll love  not refinedrd cd  much primitive  drums guitar  play loud 
5,so much fun play  the black key s first album true blues full soul  s limited edition gram vinyl 
5,ok seriously folks  friends turned onto stuff cd  the big come up  greatest thing i ve heard yet  i n t tell unbelievable mix blues garage rock  even re totally genre i promise will not disappointed  this never leaves cd player friends play parties  nyu   the guitar drumming beats raw rough fantastic great perfect complement dan s smooth strong voice  play cd beginning ll swear  the song  i ll be your man  dan swooning making believe singing right  fret rockers  the breaks  move groove  these two hip guys know things right i n t wait nyc   hear awesome live i m sure helps attractive talented  i say goodbye mtv   hello the black keys 
5,hi say like black keysst time heard punk rama  good cd anyways black keys cd ever since ive wanting hear music mix classical rock thing blues kinda whole hendix thing black keys inspierd led zephlin sooo thats say oh yeah like white stripes good band
3,pragmatically getting job done equal parts rockin bluesin  yet somehow managing reinturpret oldest sounds book make sound hip indie ears hard feat indeed  few bands play lack pretense irony utterly refreshing s sincerety guys  there definite repetition sound bog disc  self less raw ness always seems kill monotony  especially hard hitting songs insanely delicious riffs tonal simplicity 
2,obviously guys invested heavily north mississippi hill country blues r l  junior kimbrough  via fat possum catalog  although mildly entertaining  spend filthy lucre imitation stuff real deal  search real innovators sound  ve lot longer  better  soul authenticity boys akron 
2,heard cd hanging cd stores boulder colorado  system sounded great   kind stripped j s blues explosion  several long days driving get  listened  less liked   several months later never makes stack cds  fact  thinking moving ever rotating pile cds trade  guarantee never listen cd year   there n t enough hold s attention  white guys stripped blues nothing new radical interesting  listen originals  hooker  guy  waters  harpo  wells  rev gary davis  hopkins  wolf       they much interesting  if white blues crave  search green  hot foot powder  go funkier js blues explosion  completely unlike artists mention  
2,why every album review amzn   feedback level  it s anomaly i guess  which makes tougher discern true artistic gems abundance turds shat corporate oligarchy  these guys litle say shows  the rifts half assed catchy extent offering  damn  mediocrity heraldednd coming jesus becoming quite tiring 
5,once  amazon failed provide track list cd inventory    the black keys   the big come up   busted      do the rump      i ll be your man      countdown      the breaks      run me down      leavin  trunk      heavy soul      she said  she said     them eyes     yearnin     brooklyn bound     years your time  
5,i introduced black key s re recent album  brothers  loving i heard  i snapped rubber factory the big come up  i say  might favorite three  each album s fine points  particular rough  almost bootlegged quality sound  each track filled infectious raw energy s hard resist  and  breaks  probably favorite key s song date  catchy ass screeching guitar lick loops almost hip hop sounding drum beat  then auerbach s voice slides  smooth ice  i n t pull grin 
3,great band original sound infectious attitude  this disk great tracks surprisingly short  short   distortions nd foot stomp worth buying  although several tracks clinic seem messing around  it s production indie  adds charm bit  s cheap price get  overall  band get better 
4,wow  at last british band shows spirit produces prime geek rock  internal wrangler fine slice alternative rock tradition set likes devo velvet underground all songs strong zesty feel likes title track others give energy proceedings  it would nice variety expanded treat tired formulaic rock repetitive dance music 
3,although clinic initially appear insufferably mannered  internal wrangler  inspired enough work  it s still self consciously whimsical  though  meaningless  cocteau twins esque lyrics tremulous lead singer cha cha cha drume machine  bizarre diversity set makes nme friendly posing forgivable  sounding like cross babybird  tortiose random indie band  hard classify  track appears beethoven s moonlight sonata crunches  whilst short instrumental filler tracks interesting enough work  mostly songs vocal  evoke mood rather specific portrait  try go way gay dad 
1,i filed claim refund  the book never received seller respond  emails 
3,it easy put print first time  anyone brave  little crazy   that said  writer shows promise work   how make man cuddle  original thoroughly entertaining  as go book  see writer struggling find voice  he would well continue explore comedic voice  s something excels 
1,this stuff easily trite cliche collection prose love romance i ve ever read  i expecting good deal  the writing seems mindset intellectually arrested suburban kid n t experienced much life world beyond college campus so called love affairs 
5,if read  the four agreements   miss excellent energizing companion book  like  the four agreements   much content book based eastern philosophies attaining personal freedom happiness  this book expands upon  the four agreements  indicating s life dream  dream often dictated others  in light   domestication  seen root human suffering there much learned toltec way  i highly recommend book  awakening buddha within  lama surya das  there much truth food thought contained excellent  spiritually refreshing books  the wisdom learned gives direction reader path towards peaceful  serene happy life 
1,while i absolutely love four agreements return original book often  i found companion book completely unnecessary  the writing style poor rambled circles  constantly repeating  there new information  i seemed way get little money concept  shocking considering author i enjoy last pages personal examples people incorporated four agreements lives if four agreements original book  n t need n t skip get original 
3,i bought book conjunction the four agreements   a friend recommended i buy books  i disappointed as previously mentioned review the four agreements  books easy read  i see anything special topics discussed throughout book  not mention topics explanations seems redundant  i recommend friends 
2,whether ancient wisdom pop psychology  principles keeping good emotional health essentially  the four agreements restatement rules would follow  would lead happier  healthier lives    our collective pursuit answer question made wealthy psychologists psychaitrists   
5,this great book girl gets captured delaware indians i loved sooo much i suggest anyone loves read pioneer life

5,this great album  its definitely merengue callejero  lot lyrics suprises usual  there lot thinking production going merengue  and dont get wrong i like merengue  los potros really something refreshing going  although oye mi ritmo first single slamming  songs grow tremendously  vengan todas mujeres latinas jam  rebeca9 esa morena grow dont catch first listen  i like album everytime i listen 
5,for price little car lot features head tailights ability run another time without interference due different frequencies available  these cars crashed walls seem ok  the broke took flight desk steering linkage snapped wheel impacted floor  cant really complain  i bought extras price  what really matters entertains young ones helping learn controls moving expensive models 
1,i disassembled thing pieces  construction could n t cheaper  the steering achieved electric motor  servo  s  nothing   much fun  i recommend either get something much expensive  something much less expensive 
5,acting leaves something desired directing magnificient plot amazing  excellent buy
4,zoot suit movie i recommend  especially latinos  interested small portion neighborhood life la world war ii  the musical score excellent tendency urge increase volume  the acting believable  alter ego character  james olmos  constantly challenges mind determine represents   all  enjoyable

3,these obscure songs disney history  i ve disney music fan forever  i n t know maybe half  the disc good classic disney mix old new  gems i n t heard since i young 
3,well worth listen  similar atmosphere tindersticks  even less jolly  would appear potential classic 
3,i bought cd i heard johnny cash version i see darkness wanted hear person wrote haunting song  this cd first i heard bpb  i like songs  overall  so slow melancholy becomes much  makes candy says velv  underground sound positively upbeat  and coming someone loves slow  minor key music  also  billy way harmonizing makes seem like singing tune  kind unnerving 
3,this first cd i ve heard  i purchased strength reviews word mouth  it moody yes  really n t dynamics within songs  they slow  minimalist  little happening  the melodies usually directionless  songs often lack recognisable structure  thus song mood  generally dark  really ve heard part song  ve heard whole musically  i n t mean fully damning review however  it works attempts  bad album stretch  listening  i felt could much powerful atmosphic variation tempo intensity 
2,it girls first year ballet i wanted inexpensive bag  if really nice bag n t waste money  the entire bag made urethane cheap feel  the biggest positives cute graphics straps work well 
4,i read whole play day  it n t quite good musical  anyone likes music enjoy play well 
1,i admit i real problems books lack editing  this case point  this book difficult read grammatical spelling errors  misplaced modifiers abound   perhaps errors corrected subsequent printing  least  i read multiple errors nearly every page  by way  spaces paragraphs  living north coast i  i understand people living ohio might find story intriguing subject matter  however  i found difficult enjoy story stilted conversations implausible situations

1,could hardly stand listen cd five minutes     it depressing songs practically sounded    get what s story morning glory   it rocks
2,i oasis fan honest be here now n t good  the good songs d you know mean  magic pie  stand around world  long   its near good others n t worth money
1,there many comparisons oasis beatles  often band  noel gallagher draw distinction inspiration imitation  on first two albums  got away mere imitation came pretty infectious melodies  but album  melodies n t even  they ve fallen victim hype created monster  for god s sake  buy album   all around world  best song  although like rest album  someone turned studio tape halfway band s performance  way long tedious  and noel richest musicians england  n t afford cleaner production 
3,while album tends get mixed reviews  i like  it best far  include great songs like d you know what i mean  stand by me  i say  though  songs go way long production horrible  even noel hates production  most songs  minutes counting could easily trimmed minute two  the production mess  the album sounds like mixed underwater  everything jumbled mess  anyway  horrible album i love listening 
5,my review referred vinyl version be here now   with perfect large cover art   yes  makes sense now then   listen headphones   tape   
5,i n t konw everybody critic great album  i think s oasis best  got excellent guitars  inspired liam touch roof voice   there lot classics like  d you know i mean   personally best oasis chorus ever  got  stand     girl dirty shirt  wich best song entire album   n t go away  great song define hole spirit album  all around world  a piece advise  n t listen critics  first listen ll see 
2,when oasis good  catchy lyrics well thought arrangements but re bad  sound annoyingly loud rushed this cd shares bit each with good tracks like d you know what i mean  all around world  do n t go away  wonder made crappy my big mouth  i hope i think i know  etc if liked whats story  morning glory  chances like album 
4,i n t see critics even oasis fans keep downing album  and i certainly n t see thought failure     some bands never sell many records whole career     with exception magic pie  rubs wrong way  i like every song album  be here now favorite oasis songs s plain head bobbin   foot tappin  fun  do n t go away far best track album  and i love girl in dirty shirt  oasis rocks i d like talk anyone feels e mail yub_yub  excite com
2,yeah  oasis defined period wonderwall  yeah good tunes first two albums  but n t noticed play wonderwall live forever directly tracks  i give em  consistent 
5,this fantastic album  i bought definately maybe what s story  morning glory   it s longer  rougher  heavier  it s filled great songs  the album whole may weak points  songs like d you know what i mean   magic pie  stand by me  fade in out  course  do n t go away  really make must own  the album lot certain oasis style unlike what s story  i see might hit miss people  especially short songs  avgerage length  minutes   i love  great stuff  highly recomended 
3,be here now starts well enough   d you know what i mean  time quite different anything else band  in fact  hearing song radio i sure album would blow mind   n t  it s filled songs like  stand by me     magic pie     all around the world  wonderfully produced brilliant pop songs  go six minutes  latter tops nine minutes   making listner grow bored song go away  i n t help think album would sold much better songs ended four minutes  still  mealodies music make cd worth giving listen  you may tolerance i 
2,poor attempt follow morning glory  i would n t say terrible  i would n t buy given choice  shame really  first two quite good
2,oasis achieved phenomenal success release album   what s story  morning glory   followed unfortunate trend next album suffer  still   be here now  moments  the best song obviously  all around world   it s long  pretentious  stunning music video go along  s reminiscent guns n  roses  song  november rain   the album houses  the girl dirty shirt   nasaliest song liam s sung since  the rest album mostly ok  making major disappointment given brilliance last album  oasis completists album  everybody else would wise buy  all around world  single leave 
5,i n t understand noel s disdain record  hell  might favourite oasis album      i bought album august  close hand ever since  this pure  powerfully agressive masterpiece i bet get recieved better yrs go  this record subtle nuclear bomb  raw aggression  yet still listenable  unlike  hard rock  played radio days  quality  sure  s bit overdone  s necessarily bad thing  to  music serves escapism  mood changer sorts bhn completes mission flying colors  if n t listened bhn time  try  if never heard bhn give try  this is oasis s purist  rawest form    btw  i got see live bhn tour    
3,this album proof oasis bound stumble point  hubris talent carry band far  what could ve reduced ve never happened  despite bad press heeped upon album years  still possible sonic muck find bright points 
4,when i first listened album  i thought best oasis album  i kept listening  i figured album missing something  it n t contain songs stuck head i wanted keep listening like  wts  mg  definitely maybe  it dissapointing see album fade quickly charts  next album  hopefully new producer give new sound  all  good album  great  oasis could much better  i think got little lazy sloppy  hopefully  new album sound better newer  hopefully fare better charts 
3,last good album oasis   do you know what i mean  my big mouth all around the world good tracks  album inspired like first  oasis album   after totally lost interest oasis   their live shows worst shows ever   some good rock songs  completelly static posture liam total boring posture band   man  try blur bush   it s england  time way way better  
4,oasis talented british rock band reminds early days british invasion sixties somewhat like mix beatles rolling stones be oasis  overall good album  british rock  i recommend give  stars 
4,     critics  this good rock n roll album  i hate people compare first two albums this first oasis album i brought  i n t like i first listen  songs stay you this album replay value even years i brought  after listening songs  read lyrics see i mean 
2,i start stating fact  i love oasis  be here now major disappointment sometimes brilliant band hype drove band spotlight  when everbodys attention  have perform well what s the story morning glory released seemed anyone good trained ear pure pop music licking chops then yawn album released seemed lot air oasis  balloon  believe  s bad album  s    boring  nothing jumps making  a lot songs sound like leftovers albums i think album actually kicked butt  catchy tunes like ones  morning glory   oasis would    touring sharing bill black crows   i love guys  pump great tunes  rubbish simply put 
2,i n t hear new music time  i must say oasis   be here now  album i d soon forget forever  if  what s story morning glory  defined popularized brit pop   be here now  sounded death knell  i admit sound much like older oasis recordings  s problem  it s too much like older stuff sounds suspiciously like gallaghers hurry turn something  anything  a s a p  what makes album bad hyped so much  left oasis fan sharp sense taken ride  oasis may popular british band  n t best  much british talent goes unnoticed overseas  i e  silver sun  dandys  shed seven  catatonia  northern uproar   s shame  save money something original  be here now   
4,be here now oasisrd studio album release highly anticipated critics fans alike  the result good album good prior album  what s story  morning glory   the songs long sometimes sound bit bloated  the album amazing topped charts countries france  austria  sweden uk  songs standout release  d you know what i mean      stand me     all around world      
2,  be here now  moments   d you know what i mean     my big mouth     stand by me     do n t go away   along lesser tracks   all around the world    it s getting better man   true   magic pie     s another example happens re worth   cocaine supply never ending  noel gallagher admitted stopped using   ask long cd  minutes  say   well  let s fill  expletive    the production awful  knobs up  full stop  layers layers squalling guitars  all hints subtleness gone except part  do n t go away   the band still rocks  sound harsh i almost gave three stars decent songs  i ve got deduct star  phil spector hearing damage  style production  sorry guys  find better producer next time 
5,every song kicks song magic pie good  i still like song  oasis rules              
4,this album great deception  the songs long  could easily cut album  my big mouth  i hope i think i know  fade in out   others could reduced  minutes  would classics  stand by me  all around the world  it s getting better man   and least b side album   stay young   first single   d you know what i mean    but looking back years  great album  even many problems overproduction  it s strange singles work much better album  s songs really good  if album minutes shorter  would best albuns nineties  anyway  great mistake  great album  definitely worth listening 
5,to tipical oasis fan  hell  oasis  album mess  i think oasis reach breaking point created album  admitting plastered  strung drugs  but oasis peak  vocals guitar huge sounding ever  songwriting good  endearing  first two records  most people think oasis lost touch  what s story  morning glory  really ignore hype surrounding band focus music  oasis created magnanimous  influential  around ballsy rock roll album  d you know i mean 
5,    but i think theres good sounds bit scatty bit mentally produced thats  i d say  favourite album   go f   ken buy cause theres loads left  liam gallaghar july and great album  definitley maybe whats story  wonderwalls    supersonics  nothing like swirl giant noise guitar rock its mega mega album triumphant album  definitley dissapointment 
5,this  put bluntly  amazing album  sure  s best  hey  cares  to  definately maybe deserved   stars   morning glory deserved  stars   i could give greater rating  album  i would  i know bit repititous time get last couple songs  first songs good  cares go back  as long oasis recording quality albums like  i ll always fan 
2,the songs album quite boring  good ones  i would n t recommend  get previous albums instead  
2, s wrong  be here now   short  s longnearly every song two  three  four minutes longer needs bealso many people may difficulty relating theme egomania runs many songsor perhaps s album lacks balancenot enough variation grandios  lumbering anthems make majority materialthere nothing bouncy  she s electric   fast cheerful  up in the sky   fast angry  bring on down  enough pace counterpoint  supersonic   style balladry
3,first oasis greatest band world think  overrated bands world having said  be bad record suffers overexposure  good tracks got much rotation everywhere  i m peru   go figure  the best tracks obvious  hidden gems   stand     all around world     do n t go away    d you know i mean   they re instantly likeable  sound less get old fast 
2,this album bloated  boring mess  the songs overlong overloud  remind meatloaf anything else  i n t believe band created brilliant   what s story  morning glory     avoid ridiculous album costs 
1,when i heard morning glory i expecting great third album   no   this album shows evolution music oasis like sound every song  the tracks boring  voice liam really makes sleep  guitar tones never change except acoustic tracks  the bass drums play small role record  i hope oasis think  n t think  definetly maybe part    next record 
3,    dissapointing problems  some lyrics are nt good i m afraid does nt live first two albums  thank goodness ve made return form  is nt oasis s best moment 
1,the gallagher bros full subject fans mess rehashed s rock  every tune minutes long would entire album  hey jude    you ca n t always get     oasis  lyrics always pretty throwaway banally hallmark   all around world tell em heard  deep get  check unplugged bootleg appreciate oasis without noel s mosquito whine voice forget bloated joke 
1,bland  boring  nasal  banal  lyrically bankrupt  musically sophomorish  imitative  empty  hollow  stupid  worthy cd pressing  let alone comparison beatles  there  i think covers 
1,oasis arrogance way proportion actual talent miniscule  if something real buy album the beatles beach boys  this music people get excited strip malls 
2,i see noel tring album  hes tring keep rock pop theme slow bit  it didnt work  he ended lot boring  annoying noise the best tracks album are  stand me  fade in out  it s gettin  better manthe ones avoid are  my big mouth  pathetic    the girl dirty shirt  magic pieoverall  huge disappointment would recommend 
3,i bought cd i love morning glory   turns n t good move  this album continuance previous  there two good songs  maybe depending taste  as  i ve already sold copy 
3,it s good super duper excellent sounds would expect oasis  makes seem worse  even though infact good all songs drawn  seem chorus many tagged  it s little annoying  n t stop oasis fans enjoying one these tough times oasis  according vh1 s behind the music   n t blame least trying make epic record my favorites include  stand by me     the girl in the dirty shirt     do n t go away   multiply four ve got another  what s the story morning glory  hands 
4,if best oasis oasis sound  purchase  definately maybe    the masterplan   if great album different sound  buy  be here now   the band best behavior performance  taking time make quality tracks some top tracks   d you know what i mean     fade in out    magic pie    all around world   i hope next album  noel takes time sing lead songs  i yet hear bad oasis song singing lead 
3,from  biggest band world   album sounds fittingly big time  day s still stuck pub rock rut even tries expand musical reach  noel gallagher s lyrical rot persists  liam gallagher s still belting  call  singing      three  members still  well   three   but i m still mad fer  s extra star catchy tunes effort  lads 
5,this album great oasis maybe great albums  this album massive sound rock roll guitars electric sounds  and songs quite long  i would say album sort rock roll clishe album  propably favorite song album it s gettin  better  man   got massive sound good old fashion rock roll feeling  it sounds good  there good songs like d  you know what i mean  be here now the girl in the dirty shirt  mad fer 
3,this album touch definately mabye still great  advise buy dm beforehand though  
4,i n t belive much bad press album get s  it s classic like morning glory def maybe really great songs  too bad fade in out do n t go away   worst songs album 
3,there s stalinist re write history cd  the greatest thing ever  s release soon evolved a misguided overblown epic   not surprinsingly  fits pretty neatly two  the dross simply pedestrian  nothing make throw disk away  the songs long  magic pie  do know mean   outstay welcomesth guitar refrain     constantly huge guitars seem hide pretty weak songs  stand by me  wonderous all around world  girl dirty shirt  defiantly celebratory  though boorish morans tabloid press  talent within ranks shines  and noel best handle fame i ve ever seen 
5,i n t understand critics  fans  even oasis think failure  it s easily heaviest album sotsog  lyrics maybe band s best  sure  songs sound distorted amidst heavy guitar feedback  chourses  stand by me     d you know what i mean      i think  i hope  i know  still shine  be here now even experimentation songs like countryish  fade in out  releases n t  the noel sung  magic pie  self absorbed  all around the world  two songs i skip  the rest simply oasis playing good rock roll guitars roaring right behind  similar smashing pumpkins  adore  be here now band s greatest accomplishments basically overlooked fairweather  wonderwall  fans critics 
3,the first two oasis albums classics  this however  this album shows noel gallacher gotten big boots  make tune  minutes i make eight   n t anyone tell need chorus repeated times  if anyone listen album sitting i 
3,i enjoyed definitly maybe   morning glory  enjoyed be  n t enjoy much  infact quite disappointing  me oasis fan  bought recording soon released  but disappointed thinking getting money back  sorry liam  noel  think could done better  better luck next time

4,the writer original tarzan character books uses wildly creative imagination create story line follows hero john carter aftermath civil war mysterious transportation mars  carter engages nine feet tall red warriors  little green   is phrase originated    mars strife racist animosity dear earth  his fantastic ability power gravity mars places position power planet enables play hero big small events mars  the princess  yes  lovely lovable  bit warrior  e r burroughs wrote book ww ii audience  grand great granddad grandma remember writer books  movies  tv shows

4,edgar rice burroughs  well known creator  tarzan   pioneer realm science fiction   a princess mars  originally written serial form  the story painted broad strokes  generous helpings adventure  combat  romance  the writing dialogue sound quaint stilted modern ears  plot tends meander  borroughs  science may strike us today bit silly   s creative imaginative  the detailed portrait martian society fascinating   a princess mars  classic  science fiction fans enjoy curiosity quotient entertainment value

5,this great sophmore effort sparta  from  the guns memorial park    splinter  hands biggest suprise album i purchased  while hints at the drive in still float music  sparta definetely struck seperate  a track getting band may check  vacant skies  atticus  dragging lake volume ii  a track well worth mentioning  check albums disappointed  maybe someday see songs the marts volta sparta  imagine possibilites      
2,ugh  makes estomac  stomach  twist and turn  halfway album make regret ve bought album      crap   
1,sparta actually makes good album ll give mars volta material away  lack kind creative thinking flow music  continue try re hash spirit atdi     zzzzzzzzzzz  gon happen listen know mars n t everyone  collectivly changing music  taking risks devolping new style fusion   writing putting together timeless concept albums takes skill   complete control music    many artists say  sparta notice   try something new  weak songwriting catchy pop hooks atdi recognition far
4,what s wrong band  branching  experimenting music  sparta really grown since thier first album  jim ward s voice  booms  song  guns memorial park  lyrics awesome  someone else try decipher meaning lyrics  the song  tensioning  powerful accompanied beautiful guitar  ward sounds really  hurt  song reading lyrics make see describing troubling times 
3,high notes throughout extended affair sturdily melodic post punk  n t enough momentum sustain either tension beauty  kind nobley floundering 
4,i think sparta finally carved niche album proved amazing things post at the drive in  amazing songs pretty much throughout  especially  while oceana sleeps   breaking the broken     travel by bloodline   the closer album  splinters  absolutely amazing  all i think strong follow up album wiretap scars  the reason i m giving   i think production mixing little jerry finn  but simply opinion i realize probably going  rawer  sound last album 
5,cd awesome  tho wont say improvement wiretap  experiment little  tracks            good tracks imo  stand outs tensioning oceana sleeps 
1,okay   with break atdi  it pretty obvious talent went the mars volta  these guys n t suck  they boring  they sound like every band i heard making music uniqueness really  people think play instrument get deal start band  this sparta like bands industry sound exactly alike  the mars volta tried new things new things separated bands  like tool  led zepplin  pink floyd  and queen   mars volta tried something different  gained great amount respect  sparta  i million bands similar 
2,mars volta wins i could leave review line put another way  years almost remember sparta mars volta still considered seminal band 
2,i n t get cd  i listened  listened  chased  cheeseyfranks  salisbury steak tv dinner  listened nope  nothing  it s average rock bands mark knopfler put knee whoop copy procol harum s las vegas comeback effort  it s junk  kroll sparta  months ago telemarketer talked psychic network  he tells oatmeal may jump start singing showtunes line  anyway  sparta waste time saved bell  pre school years  compete 
3,sparta s porcelain wiretap scars nothing compared the mars volta s frances the mute deloused comatorium tremulant ep  um anyone say sparta s albums arer better the mars volta puts excellent bands shame

4,this book provides good overview children learn year year  subject subject  parents help achieve educational goals  one reviewer complained authors overemphasized importance limiting t v  reading kids  i teacher tell many parents n t bother basic crucial steps kids  the authors offer good analysis problems public education today  parents schools contribute   main solution problems educational system standardized testing  as teacher texas  high stakes testing rules public school system  i learned placing overwhelming emphasis annual test raise standards students  educations  actually caused many schools teach test  cheat  neglect needs gifted students order prep slower ones tests 
2,a reasonable read  good story line although i expected captain cochrane  worth look 
4,i ll declare outset i n t seen film  i n t know music unfolds disc order film  my guess probably  therefore  much less interesting  orchestral score would n t drag chain like cd  much album  distinct halves  the initial block country  country swing   novelty  tex mex tracks move along nicely disembodied dynamics orchestral movements grind towards finale  still  format make easier switch first section  rather skipping tracks  hey  maybe s distributors way  doh

4,this best books i ve read year  i loved reading family members  personalities  familiar  my favorite part reunion  main characters together  there fun stuff going  wedding cousin  plus big surprise family meeting  after reunion story turns resolving personal crises cousins romance novel fashion  overly long  somewhat repetitive love scenes  but general theme running throughout story strong sense family bring tears s eyes  it s love 
4,excellent book  lots twist turns shows love family love glue keeping family together  i love brenda jackson s books another well written novels i thoroughly enjoyed 
4,this first brenda jackson book i ve read  i really book whole time greatly disappointed ending  it seemed thought author put lot details drama throughout book flat dry ending  overall good read  i recommend

4,this reissue work  macintyre provides new introduction critically reviews sees strength weaknesses book  the book  however  unchanged text beginners find difficult book work  macintyre presumes reader basic understanding ideas philosophers discusses but adequate background wonderful book  full many insights  be warned  though  book neutral review subject matter  in book macintyre lays groundwork particular version ethics  developed fully after virtue  much book dense part  arguably  poorly written  but worth work needed get 
2,this series first experience reading moorcock  i usually avid reader  i kept finding making excuses anything except get back book  the characters lack sympathy depth  there plenty battles  plot stringing together feels stale sketchy  i ll probably finish series sheer stubbornness  i would n t recommend book series someone already fan author

5,seriously  film  watch best actresses ever chew scenery enjoy  do n t expect anything profound  watch faces  just watching emmanuel beart pout worth cost film alone  this film love idea woman appalled reality  understand else becomes clear  i rate top films i enjoy watching actors act subtle changes facial expressions  skilled  without resorting stock expressions keanu reaves  film filled best oh way fan cheesy french rock roll i deny hum along first number  the uk dvd full version extra 
1,oh dear  if  brides  brothers favorite movies means buy  women equally silly  life weird film directed francois ozon kicked academy  arnaud de moleron  set director  never employed  the set ugly steals attention away silly action songs film  fanny ardant beginning look quite piggy although figure still fine  if intention make movie veins hollywood drama musical film fails accounts  unless hard fan someone film n t waste money 
2,on first sight whodunnit  roaring snow storm house murdered  women left behind reason murder  the cast impressive  else find  superstars together movie    story line rather thin this story major feature movie  references movies genres  unfortunately  movie addict  i admit i   references go unrecognized remains lot top acting childish  often well sung  songs  a movie certainly enjoyed people good knowledge movie history  
1,i dozed part way film watching another ten minutes turned dvd player  the film seems aiming comedy  fails utterly  it anything else except weak  dark  comedy 
1,this exactly type movie i m trying avoid  i idea i came possession keep far away 
2,i n t know review honestly i split middle  in honesty reminds american film  clue   everyone stranded big house  person gets murdered  everyone motive  i n t like musical numbers really film n t hold interest well  i get kick though mistress arrives  sees dead lovers body  screams  runs firplace starts singing stripping clothes singing lines  when bill comes  pay   watch  clue  instead  much entertaining 
1,imagine getting snowbound cabin  women  universal  dead body witness woman sing dance  badly  tell story  who dunnit  who cares  a whopping french dud  see   women instead 
2,oh  awful  it desperate to be different movie corny dialogue even cornier subplots  the characters two dimensional arrogant way another  maid   you n t  wacky  risque movie  mediums simply n t mix proof film  i fan arthouse movie theater  attend regularly  movie worst i ve seen  i would recommend anyone 
1,i agree others gave star  i expecting much different movie  it trying different  quirky  funny none things  i characters nothing substance  i realize comedy supposed light funny  make laugh  fact i cringing performances especially established older actresses  the songs awful maybe bad singing choreography  i movie critic risk money guest  but  i rarely turn movie half way i  booorrrrrinnnggg 
1,as non traditional student  taught french years returning graduate work  pursuing doctorate french  i ve seen lot fine french films   femmes isn t  for charming musical  example  see sous toits paris directed rene clair early s  the forgettable songs  femmes stiffly rendered actresses can t sing can t dance  the drama murder plot oddly juxtaposed giddy females singing  well  knows  the songs organic movie  added odd intervals eight ladies gets chance demonstrate non talent  where ginger rogers need  and need score card keep track ladies reality lesbians  the scene fanny ardant top catherine deneuve  well  beyond words  kindly run  walk  nearest exit 
3,i received dvd it s awful  it n t contains extras  i would n t count theatrical trailer   but i expecting  what really makes dvd awful comes option spanish subtitles  since english subtitles n t removed  using spanish subtitles means watching film  subtitles  i n t know came idea   means seeing letters actresses faces if i n t loved film i would returning dvd 
3,this silly bit fluff fun looks great  how could  many terrific french actresses playing stereotype wife  sister  sister in law  mother in law  cook  chambermaid daughters murdered  stranded estate gradually coming realization murderer among  a s mise en scene appropriately gorgeous costumes entirely make palatable songs plot  are dvd extras  none  you see french english spanish subtitles   unlike another reviewer said  option select   femmes  see film without subtitles  in addition  languages screen let change settings except add spanish subtitling  top screen   the extra trailer  paltry fare indeed worthwhile viewing devotee french cinema 
4,having caught cinema release dec  i counting days i could get hands copy  i girls work dancing internet soundtrack  riot  and what a cast  eight beautiful  sexy wonderful actors vanilla dvd little disappointing  what i would given interviews  especially catherine fanny  a must see 
2,for famous names movie  soomething better  it predictable first  twists turns silly  they could n t leave estate  although managed arrive outside  just every involved something illicit  least something strange  lovers talked really discussed  the biggest bombshell involving supposed incest discussed two eight nothing made  this movie unrelated bunch snippets n t work 
3,the constant catfights  tirades  shocking revelations  became really much point  worth watching re fan great actresses plot worst i ve ever seen it s shame  characters captivating  if movie sort taken turn halfway left subsequent absurdity  could great 
3,okay  euro  whodunnit  decade  alright  eight women  even throw suffers cardiac arrhythmia hilarity  house various reasons discover mystery unfolding    i n t ruin ending i ll stop  
1,sure badest boring film ever seen  swear   women room  minutes far much and everybody sing chanson this horrible 
1,terrible direction  terrible writing  almost feels like director n t know working  although movie wanted race quality movie clue  fails realize plot characters incredibly riculous funny funny stupid  it total watse good celluloid 
5,i ve loved movie longest i m glass available  great customer service vendor quality product  so excited add collection 
5,announces dawn terrible  nick landed new reference work  i m sure get lots high level soundtracks near future this soundtrack immensely powerful moving  i strongly urge listen powerful system deep bass capacities  i highly recommend  repeted listenings unavoidable  s much deep moving  movie reference imho 
2,bought cd song sgt  mackenzie disappoint broken three parts cd
5,like movie  score draws listener feel  action  suspense drama story  like great scores  great listen reflecting events movie true events  and or prepare see 
2,loved movie  love music  however  tracks different titles song  very disappointing 
4,they n t entirely clear n t linear follow first dvd  series  focused technique movement  this straight workout dvd presented  levels depending fitness level  it s bad i hope series comes back 
2,i m good hoola hooper  comes super advanced stuff doing no way  popped dvd player  i n t even know  i hard 
5,perhaps finest spiritual book print  kazantzakis  _zorba_the_greek simultaneously praises spirit body  affirming human existence like around alexis zorba hero likes n t seen since odysseus sinbad sailor  he combines gruff physicality love life without falling selfish hedonism might expect  zorba indulgent  never way character destroyed zorba incarnates soul  reader  the  zorbatic  theology provides world god belief god refuses deny life  never turning live 
3,really  wonderful novel  the reason i give three stars translation awful  clearly translator either appreciate wonderful langauge author  appreciation possbilities english prose   a new translation sorely needed title 
5,on several unrelated occasions college bit afterwards  i told various folk i  zorba   like zorba   zorba   i knew reference  never read book understand implications  i recommend book i subsequently found comparison flattering  i   rather kazantzakis able grab hold grand romantic themes  youth  idealism  nationality  tradition  really give solid drubbing  similarly i would recommend  a hero for our time   mikhail lermontov  good  earthy  bookworm bashing timepieces  
4,alexis zorba highly fleshed  full bodied characters time his philosophy random acts  insanity  may well change way thinking living life 
3,the story friendship two  different ways experience life  one  living  real personal experiences  the observations  reading writing i still don t know i feel book  i mixed feelings  i m impressed book  written years ago  contains ideas thoughts advanced  i say timeless  continues apply today s world  however  i admit i struggle book  language  though beautiful  quite difficult follow many ideas i agree  modern world  course  looked upon distaste  particular women viewed time 
5,zorba perhaps memorable characters  his ethos pathos speak us  he ebullient  passionate  bruttish fragile  he alive questions humanity pathos greek heroism  it sad finish novel  comforting find waiting pages 
3,the narrator isolated figure prefers experience life books  his personality juxtaposed zorba time books  inunduated sensual pleasures life zorba direct contrast pauline teachings western soteriology  particular roamn catholic church  as zorba encourages catholic priest embrace  devils  burn monastary  reader starts see novel statement establishment pauline church  kazantzakis uses zorba explore western ideas christianity lead unproductive lifestyle 
3,the whole book dialogue zorba  incidentally found greek friend englishman zorba tries explain life means howmuch different friend understands life his message clear  life short fragile paradoxically tragically short time  contributes beauty if life indefinite meaning everything would different us we best chance live again the englishman somehow overly serious everything consider fact nothing life deserves seriousness zorba teaches important lessons found book he shows enjoy genuine aspects life like love  music eating zorba fact reflecting mentality greek people  this mentality sharp contrast rest europe  specially england  friend comes 
2,i would n t go far call brilliant  zorba refreshing likeable character  times felt bit preachy  dialogue bit overly pedantic  the story felt bit long choppy  much plot  but interesting beautiful moments reminds us enjoy life fullest  like i said  brilliant book  pretty good nonetheless 
1,i received book gift friend raved  i gave honest try  i found book unreadable  maybe s translation original greek text  sentence structure hard follow  that said  i found zorba type person i would actively avoid spending time  longwinded  drunken  sexist  generally unpleasant  the narrator annoying hero worship zorba   this book gave headache  made temples throb  i gave star amazon n t allow negative stars  i found awful 
5,instead referring jessye norman  diva   refer  supreme diva   her interpretation french german repertoire unequalled  miss norman s rich  oceanic voice enraptures listener  buy recording   disappointed 
4,i pair year  i travel europe quite bit pleased planes  they really help make air travel tolerable  however  trains  amtrak  metronorth  pick slight buzz every  also  cell phone powered within  feet bose  pick buzz every  minutes  annoying makes bose almost worthless  bose technical support responded polite     there much potential electronic pollution nearly impossible create electrnoic product subject kind interference   for   able eliminate interference upfront potential customers  or least  engineer could use regular headphones w o noise reduction on if cell phones allowed planes  i would recommend product 
3,i live asia travel alot  i love headphones  i two sets replaced due breakage arms within two years  part job asia reduce costs equipment  clearly oringinal design flawed basic engineering stress design would expect bose  my third set replaced charge design change  however company bose admit major problem recall replacement  charge if orignal model break 
2,i ve owned pair qc  s year   months started making annoying squeaking noise i wore walking  then morning  i went put head  headband cracked  making pretty much useless i ve  headphones built much solidly 
3,ias others said  sound quality great imo especially noise canceling activated  unfortunately material cheap earpieces broke extended use   years  
3,i endorse others said  the sound really great gets mp players  broke third week i  the ball and socket earpiece attaches headband seems achilles heel  a small crack enough ball  my attempt reinsert successful first time n t last long  second time entire housing split three fragments  i hope ve corrected  models  for time  i ll stick earbuds 
1,regards sound  good headsetthe noise cancelling features good    unfortunately  phones suffer discomfort pricei compared headphones  head head  airplane  sony mdr nc20  difference sound  performed excellently  equally  within airplane environment    however  sony ones comfortable much cheaperdo n t even waster time bose quite comfort    grab pair sony s ll fall love 
2,my bose headphones extremely lightly used  this second time plastic broken headphones  my husband duck tape  bose wants charge  replace defective product 
2,i reviewing bose quiet comfort series headphone  i got set gift used occassionally travel  i found headphones bulky time  still  i found noise cancelling great enjoyed sound quality  unfortunately  headphones began making loud vibrating noises year  total hours  use  bose fix  offer credit toward trade series    i would pay   tax vs    i impressed enough pay new pair 
2,in opinion  sound quality quite good  however  reviewers pointed  headphones durable  i treating plenty  today   months purchase  simply fell apart  the headband broke two places  sides  says  r   side says  l   
5,i overall delighted  the headphones sitting tight ears  comfortable hours  even wear glasses  the mentioned pressure negligible least produce warm pleasent sound  i listen mostly classical music   i n t say much categories  with ipod sound great  psp  i like feature disconnect cords cordless noise canceling device  i tested parked car engine a c running high  it advertised oasis silence  i compared akg hearo audiosphere i  twice much  i like  they well manufactured  jiggle  carriage bag nice  afterall  i n t think used skateboards  security reasons    gym  expensive risk damage 
5,these earphones fabulous  for  noisy enviroments n t problem anymore  once put  room  the earpieces comfortable 
2,the sound quality good  however  research  there design flaw headband whereby plastic covering sides crack   years use  turns  contacting bose  headphones neither factory user serviceable  you exchange new pair  cost  that s right  anything breaks whatsoever  expected buy whole new pair  so instead stocking spare plastic headband parts    bose wants pay  another pair fall apart  i n t know    i expected last bit longer 
4,i owned bose qc couple years i assure money well spent frequent long haul flyer  as business traveller takes flights year  i tried various types phones  noise cancel regular type various designs  ear  in ear  behind ear  etc  sony  jvc  panasonic  grado  comes winner hands  if audiophile requirements noise cancellation  go grado  but n t leave home without bose qc road warrior p s   i find qc comfortable qc long flights   most airlines offer decent noise cancellation phones business first class  proprietary connectors    listen stuff  stick qc  
2,bose supposed good reputation innovative audio technology  but  attempt  acoustic noise cancelling  misnomer  fact  plain misleading  it may reduce engine noise plane  hear everything else  including screaming chidren chatty passengers  the idea good  technology nowhere  i m returning back 
1,headphones need withstand least ideal conditions  akgs sennheisers survived respectively years use  sometimes got dropped fell asleep wearing  still serve well til day still sound perfect  bose set bought  plastic parts holding ear pieces frame broke  fixed side see break  plastic skin covering foam padding started  apart annoying  chemical stench coming foam sickening  gave repairing set recently tossed trash promising never touch bose  ever  ever  happy cheap koss set fraction price sounds good still works 
1,paid   years ago  after  years light use ear pad vinyl fell apart head bar rubber padding became sticky  comes fingers gets everything  the replacement ear pads n t fit frame well easily  the overall quality sound durability disappointing  i found several over the ear clip ear phones  superior every way  including comfort  quality stereo  i use cheaper ear phones i m sweating exercising  n t try bose headphones  the bose headphones n t really cancel ambient noise  i n t use anymore 
2,i ve couple years  used infrequently  always stored protective case  the sound great  shoddy materials soon make unusable  the hinges ear pieces cheap plastic break even minimal use  check complaints       give serious thought buying  it seems product inferior  customer service even worse 
1,there s short bose headphones i bought vendor  i m going fixed  i m particularly happy  the headphones work well short periods i actually hear 
4,as usual  another quality bose product  however tired replaced newer version model i understand effective canceling noises 
1,the sound quality pretty good battery life ok quality plastic used really poor  structure complex fragile  the head band brakets brake encloses size adjustment  sliders   when happens headphone comes loose headset unusable  the peace plastic could sold dollars quick fix fact get repair cycle nightmare costs lot   good deal  i looking something different i use sleeping plane 
1,the noise canceling feature works well sound good  however  cheap plastic made breaks easily  first side broke i managed tape together  then side broke fixable  you would think something expensive would durable 
5,set bose quietcomfort  noise cancelling headphones purchased kiosk located heart denver international airport  heard noise cancel products use airport flight perfect tests  ten years ago technology recently made available public years perfection worn pilots  maintenance workers required phonic protection  the sound quality blew away heard nuances old familiar recordings never noticed could even run vacuum cleaner without interference  the thing really sold genus design allowed ease replacement sound cord  part always seemed wear loss signal weakened wiring  meanwhile speakers perfectly operational  instead losing entire unit replacement simply replace cord  perfection  thank
2,i ve owned pair close four years starting physically deteriorate  the sound quality excellent  noise canceling  i used office cubicle environment later computer room  performance ipod outstanding  but point plastic upright earphone broken needs held together wire ties  rubber cover ear pieces worn  granted  i use almost every day  n t see rough use  n t type endurance i d expect  product  the two year warranty n t long enough address issues updated januaryone ear pieces finally cracked pivot point simply fell  when i contacted boise offer replace new set  
2,i second pair bose quietcomfort  headphones  like many reviews broke  the first time broke i paid  replacement pair  replacement started crack place first pair  so i quickly pulled black electrical tape effected repair completely broke  my self back patting shortlived however broke completely swivel joint  i wearing  i treated headphones utmost still broke  i fly lot noise cancelling really helps reduce fatigue engine roar i try another manufacturer  probably sennheiser  i always found sound quality fine  great re aircraft n t expect much  but i expect something costs  able stand rigours everyday life 
3,i got gift wear work  extremely people noisy environment   they better job headphone i ve tried  they most comfortable headphone i ever worn  that said  i ve exchange twice  they pretty fragile price  bose store near exchanged times without problem   the hassle finding time go   the battery life best  i live  i n t like idea noise cancelling feature on  using battery life  listen music  though  there times i could use headset need noise cancelling  option   i ve  months happy  issues listed 
1,tried bose store  oh god joke  drums sounded muddy boomy time  highs shrill unnatural  voices sounded completely hollow the sennheiser pxc  rds bose s price  blows water departments  noise cancellation  physical comfort   sound quality me  i m hoity toity  audiophile    but i friends audiophiles  plenty headphone listening  contrary previous reviewer  in fact  many audiophiles tell two hundred dollar pair quality headphones easily surpass sound quality two thousand dollar pair speakers  to fair bose headphones sound slightly better under dollar competition sony phillips  but compared sennheisers rds price  re toast 
2,i delighted get copy last it started fairly well  getting realy hard read toward end being long time hunter african bush i wondered could fill book exciting experiences which i hoping must plenty  one thing i must mention i sure john taylor proffessional butthroughout book i greatly disturbed abouth continiues comments good bad great elephant hunters i personaly think  takes lot away book reading pleasure 
5,this book covers grant s life young way though death  the book showed us complex interesting person grant  i truly enjoyed reading book found hard put  the book draws grant s life lets experience life s triumphs tribulations  anybody likes good historical fiction enjoy book  my brother read book really enjoyed 
5,when i first bought book  i thought i taking chance  but page  robert skimin takes wonderous journey interesting us history  it starts stories u s grant s early childhood moves years westpoint  mexican war  life peacetime  obviously main part book dedicated civil war  expected  skimin takes fort henry  donelson  shiloh  vicksburg  wilderness campaign  you lee surrendering grant grant s life civil war  including scandal torn presidency  skimin keeps book interesting follow life ulysses s grant  this book must read civil war point history even slight interest 
2,ulysses s grant complex  fascinating personality led dramatic  multi faceted rollercoaster life  why n t anyone able write decent novel guy   ulysses  accomplishes near impossible feat  it succeeds making grant look dull  his life presented series brief  disconnected  uninvolving scenes  personalities flat computer monitor  skimin s idea plot character development get grant drunk every page  even moments even hostile biographers accuse getting plastered  poor ulys deserves better  calling talented dramatists  next project 
3,30days   backgammon tearing corners see cardboard  i havent rough becuase another review said sent back examining pointy corners going wear quickly  well  thought quickly meantyr  beautiful wooden leather furniture  would recommen leaving cheap clasps fully open scratch rip valuables  chips thin extra space holding slot  play less  side gray black strip  thought would black  disappoint  maybe missed something  quality terrible   got gammon set buy another next year  sorry dont see place upload picture  think opt   size 
2,i sent set back within seconds inspection  the corners already dented  glue holding thin felt place sides corners already failed  i went nearby store purchased much higher quality set money  good set serious backgammon player 
2,pro  nice size  bit smaller tournament size  slim attache nice colorscon  durability quality poor  stiching point defective  large discoloration felt  dice disintegrating 
4,seems good quality  good game board  price could lower though things  i paid price gift

5,in regards eric clapton s recording  many songs cream  though extraordinary  lack incredible guitar solos cd  i n t speak stuff i n t heard much   i never knew rock could done well i heard cd   sunshine of your love     white room     crossroads  definately favorites  i think  crossroads  among best performances clapton ever done  buy cd  best 
4,  the cover art disraeli gears wheels fire  great music compact complete retrospective  the youthful energy takes balanced virtuosity  whoever heard bassist play guitar style like jack bruce  or drummer play conspicuously ginger baker  and  course  ever heard guitarist wail like young eric clapton  everyone album crossroads  as song included says   those days   
1,my rating reflection greatness cream  rather forewarning prospective buyers compilation  before purchasing compilation  consider vastly better available near price   the very best cream  features tracks presented  strange brew   additional  tracks  extensive liner notes  also  the very best cream   released  first cream best released exclusively cd  mastered using apogee s uv2 encoding vastly improves sound quality original songs  songs album  save money get instead 
5,this band unique sound i originaly got band kiss always mentioned band favorite bands as huge kiss fan  curious time listen musical origins i knew sunshine love white room but rest known me so decided get copy best man disappointed got right couldnt stop playing it some songs seem addictive  probably recorded tapes made hippy weed this collection must fans clapton  bruce  baker great rock lates  great stuff  reccommend band 
5,this cd awesome  i understand parental advisory  they swear like madmen cd  yet i still like  i heard  stick em up  radio  s reason i got cd  there r many reasonz i got cd  wouldever state  there r awesome songs cd like  tarfur    weirdo  besides  stick em up   i highly suggest cd anyone likes rap rock 
5,i bought cd i heard single stick em several times radio lyric  im mic like facist  really jumps grabs  the whole cd really great  good mix hard rap metal stuff slower balladish songs  quarashi really reminds lot  think  down   little bit cypress hill mixed  good stuff  sounds really smooth  if like linkin park rap rock stuff like   i dont really limp bizkit anymore  everything chocolate starfish whatever bad  act getting old 
2,would i recommend  yes  try get used  also i would definitely buy next hopes may  find  well defined sound  you catch bit sense trying beastie boys another level   need try quarashi clearly n t entirely sure  the first track far best album opinion  absolutely rocks rest n t teeth track  if like first track n t buy whole album  entire album minutes 
1,okay  i knew going cd d heavily rap influenced hearing stick em up  i extremely disappointed  it s basically rap  they get people even listed part band play occasional riff guitar provide background bass  the thing made cd worth  tarfur    s supposedly first rap song written entirely icelandic  however  quarashi makes limp bizkit sound like metallica  quarashi heavily rap  i would n t recommend  cuz re even good mcs  i picked bucks  i would n t pay i 
2,found cd quite generic  music   bland lifeless  equal parts rap  singing  vocals predominant mix  music ok  heavy slighlty melodic never got  music scream stero say listen to this cd failed grab attention 
2,like quarashi s sound  s fun enegertic  n t really move anywhere explore possibilites  think real talent guys seem content throwing obscene expressions like bunch year olds finally gotten hold main office s system  say people try push guys sounding like korn total morons  quarashi sounds sort like beastie boys steroids   s best comparison think  re really looking anything deep particularly inspiring instead mindless music  quarashi fun  enough collection already  skip 
5,in world lame metal rap fronted bands limp bizkit kid rock hard find new original music  however  quarashi s  jinx  brings whole new unique sound music  their first single  stick em up  full heavy guitar laced hard hip hop beats  each song album shows talent range quarashi  whether s harmonies  rhymes  beats  rock ability  powerful lyrics definitely something everyone album 
4,having read wilder sisters  bad girl creek now along came mary i m waiting patiently good bye earl  my favorite far bad girl simply becuase i feel like i  know  characters   typical way good friends see eachother  need eachother   know eachother  mary great added characters dogs  maybe someone give earl birthday

3,you find good selection french hip hop soundtrack  unless re marseille  artists album could considered underground  it means n t get cheesy songs give bad reputation french hip hop  rap marseille really hit hard  this album good better french hip hop compilation  i d suggest taxi soundtrack   it s way better 
2,am trying make due since i purchased  it s overpriced   compared spartan sports talking pedometer  almost product except different colors plastic   the stride mechanism sticks occasionally i shake device get work i agree previous comments  problems  it s easy accidentally press button top turns annoying music  s easy accidentally press button top turns alarm  s easy accidentally press big button front speak number steps distance ve walked

2,it decent little kit  worth  pay  little disappointed  could used kit 
3,this grandson  the set small unimpressive container  the set contained small amount drawing pencils 
2,purchased dvd gag gift brother  he girlfriend watched said kind raunchy  it good gag gift  maybe best watch 
3,the movie yucks  personally  i think genre borat  little funnier overall 
1,deodorant control works gluing pits shut  seriously  stuff sticky nasty 
2,i struggled book beginning  i look  star reviews wonder wrong book boring never went anywhere  i found wading lot unnecessary verbiage made go much slower  and story n t grab worth read  maybe i m impatient writer get point little excitement  i n t find lewis  better books even though touted  i m great fan greek mythology often struggle lewis  writing combination two beginning  his writing n t help  see  happening   i guess i n t appreciate world calls  great  writing 
5,upon first reading book rather fundamentalist christian teenager  i disappointed seeming lack  overt  christian message  during second reading  following conversion roman catholicism  approximately years later  i moved tremendously protagonist orual s tendency clothe defensive strength rather yielding faith  the book suddenly seemed  modern   i smiled i wondered lewis would think able see  indeed  hopefully  accurately book wrote years ago reflects struggle womens  there something deep lurking spare somber prose female and male readers  if ever longed plunge mystery  learn balance ultra rational side faith filled portion soul  i strongly recommend book   by lori pike  friend s e mail 
3,this anything c s  lewis writer i huge fan narnia series  this note caution reader  i avid reader mythology story cupid psyche absolute favorites  it said anyone truly loves myth forwarned reading practically resemblance myth told viewpoint psyche s older sisters  i came book preconceptions severely disappointed i read  i could even completely finish book 
2,maybe i n t know story cupid psyche i read book i overly moved book  i especially enjoy part ii  i kept wondering  heck going    thank goodness lewis included summary traditional myth end might helpful read part first 
3,it give explanation psyche prompted see mysterious husband  the book needs taken context written  a good read i bit disappointed ending  typical strangeness c s  lewis cryptic drawn 
4,the book brilliantly written long concerns orual s passionate indictment gods  it loses power  however  lewis falls prey tendency preach  part  undermines rest book first telling reader think couching lessons implicitly christian context  in way  reminiscent  the last battle   coda mars otherwise enjoyable  chronicles narnia   
4,having heard much book wheaton professor  i finally read expectation receiving great insight  for  i re read  i think  there hints truths  i know i missed  since i accustomed didactic presentations  did n t quite realize indeed retelling old myth  at rate  interesting read  even taken superficially 
4,you may find book slow going first  stay  as orual begins  find niche  develops fascinating character strong protagonist  i thought novel extremely moving highly enjoyable  i would recommend anyone enjoys c s  lewis  mythology  story featuring strong likable female protagonist 
5,i recently read till we have faces  read disappointment decade ago i still high school  after first reading i sold gave away copy book  thinking i would never desire read  i m glad i changed mind gave second shot  it gripping probes deep soul explores destructive fruits self centered love need reality facing deformities souls  i could n t put plan read future  needless say  i hang copy   
3,not i expected still good read  unlike lewis s works  book obvious links christian theology since based greek polytheism  however  book deal theme limited knowledge god means often understand difficult events lives happen theological perspective  if lewis s narnia books fable version  mere christianity    till have faces  loosely fable version  the problem pain   
5,probably incredible books i ve ever read  read works  incisive piercing every time i revisit agony reality presents   lekhem panim  hebrew refers bread g d s presence  literally translated  bread faces  resides holy place  something need nourishment souls  cs lewis definitely consumate baker 
1,this book extremely hard boring read  if n t fact book club decided book december  i would given long time ago 
3,in  till we have faces   c s  lewis created entertaining  thought provoking reinterpretation greek myth cupid psyche  the myth  hands  becomes christian parable apologia transcendent god remains unseen unheard  like friend  j r r  tolkien  i cordially dislike allegory  he interesting things say selfish love authenticity  story drips self conscious wisdom profundity  it left aftertaste narcissism 
5,c s  lewis good mixing faith stories  maybe s stories gripping  this retelling psyche eros unpredictable moving  if narnia children  faces  teaching fable adults 
5,upon the chore of moving all of our stuff to another city   i job selecting ones i keep  when i came till we have faces  i looked thru i realized i failed read  so next read unpacking  i enjoyed first reviews printed  i believe i more c s  lewis author  it seems favorite ones the four loves  the seven storey mountain  the asian journal  new seeds contemplation  contemplative prayer  dialogues with silence  as i recall being in louisville  i drove to the monastery of gethsemene i saw little house spent time solitude writing when i sat choir morning prayers  plus later day times prayer  i realized power silence  prayer connected litergy chants  hymns  i surely returned prison chaplain s office renewed vigor  retired chaplain fred w hood
4,you really enjoy book  lewis rare individuals able express truth clarity power  feel heart  i found book beautiful exciting believe day faces 
1,boring  snoring  least alluring   obvious  sophomoric terribly uninteresting   oh yes  i mention tedious  i m sorry  book torture beginning  humble opinion   with background classics religion  degree  i much looked forward reading book  liking  there something csl s writing   resonate  i say exactly  i ve read works  felt much way afterwards  perserverance always good noble thing i suppose  time spent reading book could better used enlightening pursuits similar sentiments expressed much greater effect   number ofplaces   bible classics poetry  music  opera etc  jtq
1,sadly  great disapointment  if honest say boring awful book ever read  like last commenter put well  title read  truely boring book  avid reader  i love classics  nothing common real myth book distressing  found wanting slash wrists awful boring hysterical book never takes  i kept reading comments readers  however could carry put book  i dont think ever read boring moronic text 
1,i read many lewis  books outdoes power perelandra  reviews give flavor  the content five stars  kindle edition sloppily done goes past mere annoyance sometimes interfering csl communicating  needs proofreader re release available free previous purchasers  like  
5,i read book time i starting really dislike c s  lewis  i read book i fell head heels love  this book perfect     all book terrific favorite parts always fill joy    and oh dear lord heaven  ending     aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh    i ecstasy  far finest well developed conclusion ever                till we have faces book psychological profoundness depth could sink never find s meaning  i m still yet i n t 
4,if ve read reviews  wondered everyone raves till we have faces  stick book chapter ten  it s little sluggish reach chapter ten  make plans turn page  you n t put point i amused  i think  rigid assertions reviewers  lewis trying say  if put assertions  ignore  plain simple  n t listen single person says book means because first time read  ll understand way  the next time  grown  changed  aged  oh sigh  yes even matured  understand another way  you identify character another depending becoming  read philosophy theology differently depending believe moment but  read  s likely read 
2,up  i never disappointed book c s  lewis  fiction  fantasy  non fiction all top notch  gripping beautifully told  i found first person narrative  till we have faces  thoroughly unconvincing it never rang true story told female protagonist  the language seemed unnecessarily stiff  even allowing style imitative epic prose  i would discourage anyone reading book first contact c s  lewis  s probably interesting anomaly readers well acquainted work  
4,this book great  read book club helped understand meaning  enjoyable read well

2,i think plot movie difference loving selfish unberable confusing situation  the plot christian perspective bit limited could developed  there special effects occured frequency movie progressed  these better i expected  could better  the whole movie seemed bit amateurish i appreciated christian perspective portrayed 
4,these episodes hilarious  squidbillies aqua teen hunger force favorite adult swim shows i disappointed shows decided switch single dvd release format opposed  disc sets past what mean buyer  less episodes set time around key special features missing  there commentariesrd volume  the  squidbilly circle jerk   favorite special feature first two volumes  doesnt get another sequel  it feels like features the packaging deluxe previously it still deserves high rating though manage pack alot stuff onto disc  step backward first two volumes

3,the dvd new rewrapped given appearance  was shipped fast dvd work
3,i purchased blu ray movie trip back home holidays watch ps i returned  i specifically picked movie two reasons  first well written directed  the second reason odd  beneficial household  japanese offered voice subtitles blu ray version  my wife japanese would background behind choice  i dismayed find case  despite advertised  i able find every language except japanese  had customer  i sure would big deal  unfortunately  main reasons i purchased  i try get money back soon possible  despite drawback  movie looks wonderful high definition 
4,it exciting finally reach understanding acharacter called batman  we taken life times brucewayne whose personal expierences responsible dedication tofight injustice bring brightness lives people arebeing preyed upon unscrupulous villians  this crusading dark knight isaided quest loyal butler alfred 
3,i thought movie started slow  batman  showing hour film together alright film  but i mad get i bought widescreen version wal mart came home find special features  i came find found amazon  disc version wal mart n t  i n t understand would release movie dvd days without special features  it become common thing every dvd get special features especially big movies like  there version new dvd released people n t  buy wrong accident like i  so i go spend another  get  disc set  anyone buy regular version  get yahoo messenger  my niner4life  
5,it s rare find treat theatres days  disappointing acting  unoriginal stories  recycled plots create crapfest bad movies  however  the dark knight shows us n t need way  heath ledger  rest soul  truly top game choices excellent actors  the story line  obviously somewhat recycled  forgivably   original going get  whole movie carried without much way flaw  granted  pick things  wrong  within realm suspension disbelief in case  movie worth owning ledger s performance 
4,i bought movie basically price would cost rent  i complain  i going offer review movie  better places find  i going recommend  like movie think might like movie  better buy price rent buck less 
4,the bottom line  the best batman movie yet made  including the dark knight   batman begins suffers miscast katie holmes extremely over the top tom wilkinson portrays bruce wayne s transformation batman realistically possible  superhero movie modern age 
5,excellent    i wish i could forget batman movies  even ones tim burton directed  although michelle pfeifer pretty hot catwoman  if all super hero movies done like movie  in opinion even better spiderman  even women i know n t like super hero movies love  s right  love  movie  it basically character driven drama action  and  villains n t upstage main character all previous batman movies  if looking super hero movie  look  this is it  i n t wait see dark knight summer   
4,mean batman movie better twos batman batman    think batman movie better following comics  batman movies think far  micheal keaton  verison batman  nail  bale verison  follows comics ra  ghul pit makes young 
4,the drugs  i mean batman movie drugs  that s movies anymore  drugs  ca n t people something different drugs  none batman movies drugs  just  this flaw movie  if next batman movie drugs i going mad  christopher nolan needs something drugs  and train fight  this pretty much copy spider man   correction two flaws  otherwise dark story great special effects 
1,like reviewers  i problem second disc  i sent back once twice  i tried  copies movie  second disc still would work copy  this movie great  do not buy this edition  unless dvd n t work  they really need fix problem 
3,i m sure i like christian bale batman bruce wayne  everytime i see  i await pull chainsaw start slicing people  yes  i m referring role american psycho  a role never able escape  opinion  he looked menacing everything since movie  and batman begins exception i miss interpretation michael keaton  before  would fathomed keaton batman  he predominately comedic actor  but made work  he slightly off kilter bumbling  could still kick butt time  he understood balance difference bruce wayne batman  something none others could i m going even comment casting katie holmes  girl barely mid twenties playing d a  we seem witnessing problem latest superman movie lois lane  hollywood  women thirties around 
2,i liked movie i m big fan widescreen  i dissapointed version contain bonus features  except theatrical trailer  no  making   actor bio s  commentaries  etc  also  version contain scene index  the inserts symantec software rebate coupon batman collection catalog  very cheap packaging  i m surprised case plastic instead cardboard 
2,i dont know people like movie much  it takes forever get going  i know setup backstory still really boring  doesnt even feel like batman movie it barely shows villians  way much dialogue much action  even batmobile scene city isnt exciting  it goes like mph  the blu ray quality top line stuff compared best  i looks kinda like upconverted dvd  watch preview dark knight disc instantly see difference  also  league shadows  storyline laughable  haveing seen the dark knight days ago  say easily  star movie  it starts right entertaining throughout   stars movie bluray
3,cut val kilmer george clooney movies  still found watching thinking  show something new     referring special effects  christian bale holds promise  help  filmmakers always think need    hours tell   hour story 
2,i could n t wait see movie many good reviews  but    without read reviews synopsis   i would n t clue happening movie  there many flashbacks middle scenes never knew  i like christian bale  fine acting lost fancy editing  and katie holmes  acting like piece cardboard  thank goodness someone loaned movie i n t pay  what disappointment  sorry  i know reviews great  must watching another movie 
4,i watch movie standard  i finally watch hd dvd version  although movie  ok   hd version awesome times brilliant  yet times  ok   i hd collection n t top hd dvd movies  seasbicuit phantom opra   i love dark side batman made movie little better playful hero  i m happy purchase good collection hd s 
5,where began  amazing movie great two movies following  the last movie  dark knight rises  relates back movie couple times good idea see first 
5,what i say n t said  this first movie trilogy great  great effort made really explore batman psyche  they explore become batman  i n t think saw bruce wayne batman costume first minutes movie  this made previous batman movies  as dark knight fan i loved movie 
5,love batman love movie  sure  awesome keep watching 
5,this gift  the person received loved  great detail due blue ray  a must see batman fans 
3,bonus star great production the movie slow  boring  cliched beyond ridiculous  i could n t wait 
4,this movie arrived within couple days  very good packaging i pleased order i placed  thanks much 
5,would paid even i love new batman series  the hd nice i watch repeatedly 
1,right middle batman begins dvd i received abundatrade movie froze would n t pick   scenes movie  i never purchase anything abundatrade ever 
1,after first minutes senseless violence stilted dialogue i could bear watch rest film 
1,would never imagined million years supposed tlc focused flick  could poor  s outrageously bad  plot   wait plot  see ninjas jumping around closing ranks bruce  n t fall asleep first hour   ll get enjoy  disjointed plotless cra   unfortunately paid see avoid
4,a great conclusion great series  if enjoyed first two films series  must watch 
3,of three latest batman flicks  probably visually interesting  however  lacks  comic booky  feeling  good examples superman the crow  i prefer movies genre  the acting terrible  mr nolan needs find stronger female leads  overall  entertaining  i n t watching second time 
4,reminds first edition batman comics i think i read  if  s close  christian bales good sometimes bumbling  sometimes wrought emotional character revenge parents  untimely deaths  learning caped crusader implementing many tools belt battle evil something revealed batman feature films  michael caine plays alfred well  i first saw movie tcm amc  liked well enough add dvd collection 
4,christian bale  michael caine  liam neeson  gary oldmanand morgan freeman star action film basedon comics  after parents murdered  brucewayne becomes vigilante hero gotham city  i likehow went back dark roots christian isgood  this dvd set nice picture soundplus neat extras  i recommend good batman film 
5,wonderfully entertaining  nothing stay forever like lost battlestar galactica worth price rental  katie holmes particularly good 
4,good movie batman got started day age technology learned fight fight group people think city needs 
3,of course  review refers regular dvd edition  bd gift set film apparently loaded goodies  as  thing this good  remove postcards zip drive  nice i finally  heck     use box hold two disc  batman begins  dvd two disc  batman  gotham knight  dvd  the latter special feature style thing  anyway  rather real stand on its own feature 
5,thankfully terrible batman movie streak  i wish ignore every batman movie since batman batman returns  as far i m concerned original  version ones worth watching  bale best batman  due respect keaton 
4,christian bale is batman i think best played super hero past  i think orginal batman others poorly written somewhat bore  i mean val kilmer george clooney talants best used films aa val kilmer s performance the doors incrediable  lets girls would love see george clooney scrubs playing ever sexy slighty turlmoulus doug ross er  bale gives something charcter actors able creditability mystery 
5,this best movie far  with dissapointments star wars worlds i decided go see  i impressed movie  you get story bruce wayne training learning better fighter become dark night  and n t listen people movie boring  this story great action  if see gret movie go see movie  or see crap listen nay sayers watch fantastic four  but n t regret watching movie 
3,   s done seen   best movie ever     fantastic   comes  well personally i absolutely idea  it s good movie  s mindless fun fantasy  s  the beginning movie reminded instantly  highlander   first   rest could inspired thousand  dark  action movies   the crow  example   so easy  batman maniacs  bale good actor   suits  part oldman sadly wastes talent  favorite actor   goes freeman caine  no disaster  nothing remembarable  i could n t help feeling script missing something  and beginning hurry  time quite long movie  not good combination  in words  highly overrated  entertaining  and worth seeing  i d rent buying though 
5,i honestly expected less i wathced movie  best batman ever   loved scarecrow plot  renting rest trilogy tonight 
4,the movie seemed dark first  good storyline  kept edge seat christopher good looking 
1,a lot people told batman begins good i n t like  the first hour long slow without batman bruce wayne training becoming batman batman show last hour  i m really big fan liam neeson though s boring s really point batman movie s nothing exciting  it really n t surprising  christian bale make excellent batman voice really fitted batman whole movie good  wait dvd n t see theater  that s i say  i thought war worlds better batman  batman begins really sucked 
1,ratings  this worst films i ever seen  terrible acting  storyline special effects  i actually threw  it makes kilmer s clooney s versions look good keaton s looks like masterpieces 
1,i watched movie first came thought really boring disappointing  i generally like katie holmes think fine movie  christian bale lousy plot direction movie  if see series technical movie stunts followed mildly romantic scenes surrounding plethora neurotic  self absorbed dialogue  psychosis  horrible directing  might interested watching movie 
3,i like superhero movies like comic book  i ll tell christian bale thing i told michael keaton  val kilmer george clooney    you sir adam west   
2,it thought movie going cool  beggining boring fell assleep  but cool 
1,am i n t like movie  why critically accliamed beyond  it   bleh  the action  characters  acting  dialouge     bleh  sure  may best batman movie  s saying much  the talk going dark realistic movie  i saw another silly superhero fare  i guess i n t like superheroes  if interesting dark action flick  check bourne series  batman little kids comic book fans 
5,mean even star cast turned joke  this batman supposed interpreted  know many sagas comics  newer ones darker theme 
5,had seen got watch long flight  enjoyed flight even though i middle row 
5,great movie composed amazing story good acting  batman begins best batman movies release followed equally enjoyable film  dark knight 
3,the movie awesome  i definately recommend movie  wary  disc set  i problem another reviewer  special features disc nothing  it comes wb logo  legal jargon nothing  tried dvd player  two computers  even upon returning another copy  second disc refuses play the movie really great though  review concern features disc technical errors    
5,damn good movie great cast  christina bale is batman gary oldman  i huge fan  breathes life commissioner gordon character  i wait sequel 
4,i thoroughly enjoyed movie  great effects  good plot line   well worth money good change previous batman titles   i thought good  hey  s comic book  
3,this first batman trilogy weakest terms performance  story however  i recommend watching order get third  final series  they simply get better  improving actors cast  performance  story  it comes together perfectly  go ahead watch three back back  loved 
4,since final movie dark knight trilogy came long ago  i decided get speed happened far release  and boy i glad i  christian bale hot i loved seeing put paces 
2,love movie problem quality product case useless doesnt hold disk place led disk freely thumping around shipped scratched looks like used 
5,a great blu ray disc start new blu ray disc collection  ca n t wait see black knight comes later  probably around x mas  
5,to date  best matman movie yet  i must admit  i bit apprehensive since batman movies past seemed plain cheesy  however  batman begins proved exact opposite s predecessors  starring christian bale  batman begins  true to life   s past emits dark  goth  atmosphere  more underworld like  movie   you see 
3,my wife i really enjoyed movie  it everything cracked  good effects  good action   it would great movie insipid performance katie holmes  there countless female actresses could played role better   oh   try suspend disbelief give chance play character dramatic scenes   never able get eerie feeling dawson s creek made somehow script  she s ready big screen   perhaps films might  it s sad case i would probably bought film lackluster performance  on positive note   all characters actors superb 
5,ok  nutshell  almost like watching batman documentary  top villians  goofy sidekicks  complete origin batman  very good acting well paced  movie polar opposite batman  robyn 
5,what great cast   christian bale  tom wilkinson  cilian murphy  liam neeson  michael caine  morgan freeman  greatest living actor today   gary oldman  what could ask  this movie introduces beginning batman  well introduce two new villains batman live action franchise  scarecrow ra s ghul  it wonderful mix comedy  drama  action  well nice ending  gotham never looked beautifully depicted nolan done  you n t disappointed movie 
5,absolutly incredible  batman begins best films ever  placed upon shoulders blue ray  batman begins even better incredible sound amazing picture quality 
5,i already regular version great film well worth expense buying blu ray version  the excellent quality rich colors super sharpness blu ray version worth expense  i would recommend blu ray disc 
2,bruce wayne trained ninja  he could single handedly defeat ninjas  including mentors  he got weapons gadgets inventor late father s company  where park batmobile fighting thugs rescuing girlfriend  how drive batmobile without noticed first place  the ninjas going kill  giant beam fell  left alone  rescued butler    they tried fit pieces  ended leaving many holes 
2,this film is utterly terrible in the way that it cancels out the original batman movie and batman returns  turns out jack nappier didnt kill bruce wayne s parents  it was some other bloke  that is the main thing that bothered me about this film  also at the end the joker seems to be handin out cards  dont think so  nappier fell into a bowl of acid and turned into the joker  he isnt the sort of guy to go throwin joker cards about  very stupid  batman and batman returns are the best batman films made  keaton must be outraged cus i would be if i was him 
2,batman begins would ve better movie s original character  although comical times constant changing lead actors playing batman  i e  michael keaton  val kilmer  george clooney   consistency  batman begins n t quite offer insight re watching  is tibet  okay  halfway find locked  batman begins tried darker  the unimpressive batmobile  hummer  dune buggie dragster fusion   maybe new generation kids enjoy  but new twist batman   stars  as standalone hero  begins would deserve maybe  stars 
1,this movie sucked bale sounds like froggy of our gang as batman  fight scenes solid crap  bale horrible batman  worst i ever saw  if i could give it a moon insread of one star i would moon it    
1,boring  it s already been on for an hour and nothings happened  i ve had to stop every  minutes because i ve been so bored  the original series was so light  fun this is painful 
1,boring  dragged  thought would never  this movie terrible      not fun like batman movies     
3,if already actual movie gift set worth money  comes bunch extra cardboard  usb  dark knight sneak peek disc  really latest trailer  features double disk version  i m sorry pre ordered  that third time i bought movie however n t see movie absolutely buy 
5,pretty much everything already said fantastic movie  raised comic book adaptation bar well beyond x men  even spiderman  said  little add i noticed lot people complain fight scenes  they quick  confusing chaotic  this exactly like bunch bats swarm by that intent fight scenes accurate other major complaint brain dead movie  there plenty movies keep mouth breathing  knuckle dragging budweiser crowd happy  not every movie needs mindless  go watch die hard something 
5,i loved  action great  and kept going way you really buy movie it good 
4,this sure good movie  michael keaton still makes better batman  everyone else immitation michael keaton s batman role 
4,this movie made christian bale fan  he fantastic actor someday recognized great  the special effects super story shows person wealth socially valuable  that nice twist departure demonizing born wealth 
4,i know recent movie goers theatre recently  i  we re charged n t get control  get bat grip  the best batman movie tim burton original  batman returns comes next batman begins somewhere around  the schumacher ones  superb  still moments the batsuit make bale look sometimes like fatman  the batarangs rusty looking cool enough  i like action sequences story circled fear  the early training stuff seemed go little fast all  batman begins good movie  i think people need think twice label bale better keaton  heeeelll noo     o
3,  batman returns  may satisfy aficionados  n t create converts  as comic book adaptation  average  those particularly enthusiastic genre likely watch movie goes  unwilling fully drawn fantasy universe gotham city  batman begins   the special effects decent city looks real  the acting  however  particularly part christian bale  near non existent  as training sequences  story bland  stale sometimes unexplained  the fight choreography fails impress  editing heavy handed unlike rest batman series script  begins  tells story batman boy  the story boy bruce wayne line movie whole  interesting regards unconvincing many others 
4,what great start hopeful new trilogy  it little long  easily smartest batman films today  i much look forward next 
4,batman begins really good film it gave us good look bruce wayne became batman nolan brought back darker batman loved comics  along new villains ve never seen batman film  one i really happy christian bale played bruce wayne batman he brought back seriousness role michael keaton had i thought ra s ghul great villain it kind letdown though  see much middle movie just beginning end i happy johnathan crane scarecrow i didi n t think guy putting potato sack head gassing people scary all overall though this still great film i highly recommend  ve never seen 
3,  i everything i could get latest software updates bdp s1 blu ray player preparation disk  by time i updates i latest software right sony s website  it looked great i finally got playing  took   attempts reason  may player   however  i watch entire movie finally seeing dvd menu extra features  i really wanted watch dark knight movie preview right away bummed  also  finally get  menu looks hastily put together  it rushed   beta  edition feel  normally i really n t bells whistles dvds  i exceptionally difficult time dealing disk  bummer time favorite movies

5,this batman movie i ve waiting  tim burton s batman favorite  the storyline  action  sets  acting  movie surpassed previous batman movies  especially recent joel schumacher ones horrible  the actors picked batman ras al ghul perfect  scarecrow  this movie true comic book  thankfully  showing not joker killed bruce wayne s parents  it mood must batman flick  without type pseudo universe created like tim burton movies  too bad halle berry n t wait film become catwoman  a better director costume would made ultimate catwoman finally  director n t base movie campy s tv series  i m already waiting sequel 
1,i suprise recieve dvds disc  feature film  special features your feedback features column product defect 
2,once  way way way overhyped  i really expected best batman movie yet  omg i wrong  i fight stay awake first hour  boring  i think christian bale sucked batman  it s hard even express stupid batmobile looked  and batman talking like dirty harry  the best parts movie  shown commercials  if christian bale plays batman sequel  least i ll know waste money seeing 
1,do n t waste time money  the movie quality fuzzy   play buffers stops constantly  i cable modem problem youtube netflix  i reported problem amazon gave   credit  year ago problem still  i m going get dvd 
2,sorry batman fans i n t like movie much n t show batman last hour  i wanted like i really people watch first hour without batman  the last hour great first hour kind slow  i get go home first hour really boring batman showed bruce wayne trained batman  christian bale made excellent bruce wayne voice fit part batman beginning long i really wanted see batman show n t last hour  i liked original batman movies better batman begins sucks 
5,gone campy top villans last movie series  adam west silliness either  story suspend disbelief actually get character bruce wayne batman  previous celluloid batmen little cardboard cutouts  lives breathes  bit skeptical new batmobile design seeing action believer  hope beginning long fruitful franchise venerable dark knight  bonus features second disk informative enjoyable several mini documentaries set costume design  action sequences  nice segment comic writers artists inspirational film  bonus comic nice addition package 
3,when say enough super heroes movies  comes  batman begins   change minds good script  story well known  very good acting chritian bale 
3,batman begins interesting look formation batman things movie bothersome  overall i d say christian bale pretty good job portraying batman dialogue delivery horrendous times  the worst occurence interrogates guy rooftops hes pouting trying look real mean looks ridiculous  and way asks questions pathetic deep grawl like  whooooo      wheeere  pretty bad  that scene alone damn near ruined entire movie  and katie holmes crap role completely forgettable  i think probably chose role since innocent look would fit character idealist pure despite corruption city shes terrible 
2,i m sure movie gotten good reviews  it good  the dialog awful  plot ridiculous  destroy order save   i wish liam would stop taking mentor roles the final scene physically impossible  swinging train moving  ask swung past pylons held rail 
3,this better last batman movie ever make  their already four batman movies fifth hollywood make something orginal  to batman going style nobody watches cartoon show wb  morgan freeman movie i think good actor  i saw previews advertised tv looks good enough  a horses breathes fire theis movie 
3,this movie geared teen crowd  plot ok drawn  this movie could made half time much better movie  way many fight chase sceens much filler  less cases   did pay director minute  it s ok movie deep intellegent movie is t 
4,batman begins time favorite i wanted blu ray  the transfer excellent  atp    mitsubishi dlp  picuture stunning  no macroblocking fast scenes  like dvd release   audio sounds amazing  however extras bit slim 
4,batman begins great movie  doubt i m sure know  that s though  thing great set  the postcard picture s nice whatever know  and comic alright n t really character s wan see  s bank job the dark knight s big deal  in i recommend movie truly hard core hard core fans new batman movie s  for  fan batman hard core fanatic  blu ray s self would better buy 
5,this favorite movie star wars episode iv return jedi  it s dark movie tiny bit scary  s still great  in batman fights ducard great battle train  it s great movie 
4,darkness  evil  corruption   thats ll get watch movie  but turmoil gotham  beacon hope  though beacon quite dark  bruce wayne  played talented christian bale  batman  hero people w set problems   dating back parents murder boy  throughout movie tries deal issues saving gotham  bad guy   the special effects movie incredible  plus batmobile kicks a   i would definitely recommend movie anyone looking dark  moody entertainment 
4,batman has always favorite comic heroes  this movie departs somewhat whimsical  goofyfied villans last installments returns serious feel  it explores bruce wayne evolves batman ninja like training cool gear his mentor becomes nemesis great finale  this really cool movie  i amature film maker  making  features dvd real education  my critique fight scenes shot tight n t get good look action 
4,it s dark knight     anyway  still better  original  batman movies  at least quality video great 
5,great addition dvd collection  shipped fast perfect condition arrived 
5,the film wonderfully written beautifully shot  nolan perfect bruce wayne batman role  he plays irresponisble playboy well  credible fighting machine known batman  the movie takes  time getting batman suit  a friend watching film familar comics thought dragged bit beginning  i disagree  i read batman comics since i   this version batman seems alone lines frank miller version character  a bit darker side  believeable hero current world  this great character piece well terrific action film  worth picking 
5,if ve seen first  films batman series go see  begins  expecting expand already know  re disappointment  if re fan animated series  robin nightwing batgirl course   batman dark  mysterious  drives car looks like lamborghini tank s love child i m looking forward next movie revamped series  this ve started years ago  except christian bale probably still elementary school back  i hear s interested sequels  keep coming 
4,do n t expect bat junk like  shark repellant   it s darker tim burton s complexly makes forget modern incarnations pg rated goffery  this film great build great explanation things  bruce works hard fails continually  get see develop suffer importantly get great new bat mobile the problem i film scarecrow seems unnecessary  the movie worked hard present new kind realism seems detracted stupid mask appears  henri ducard good enough villain scarecrow seemed get way still  great picture  easily watch 
5,batman batman returns rocked solid batman forever batman  robin ah  re crap  this best yet  the first time i saw prievew ah  ok  but i sawnd i freaken excited  but main question   who will be the villain  it better be joker or else i m gon na cry  i m joking    
5,think dark  scary  violent get like fantastic four maybe re re mood opposite ok  s excellent like like fantastic four  
4,i like batman movie lot  i  except adam west movie   but holes story left wondering in first movie  bruce s parents killed joker  s wants joker dead  but movie  killed someone else completely the story keeps changing fell bat cave boy  in movie  falls cave running angst parents death  in batman begins  bruce falls bat cave parents still living  s playing around wayne manor there things led believe keeping storyline n t important different directors  but overall  good film add batman collection 
2,i get sick tired faces  i know  stars  make living  learn trade  like carpentry  i watched usual explosions shootings got bored minutes  overkill usual 
1,i purchased item  advertised  japanese subtitles watch friends speak english  when i received movie put watch  does not japanese subtitles  it disappointing 
3,alot people saying film came great wasnt great  batman begins problems like every time theres fight scene camera always shaking dont know whats going plus christian bale worst batman affence christian  good american psycho machinist christian worst batman stupid gruff voice  i dont bash batman begins much isnt worst batman film made  would batman robin  batman begins alot flaws fixed next film dark knight 
3,movie not jokes      super hero movies jokes  like  spider manfantastic four teenage mutant ninja turtles movie  nope single joke oh well never really liked batman anyway
5,i watched batman begins i say wow      the  batman movie  its bad wasn t first batman movies  its well written lots action  the first movie little slow rest makes  if looking couple hours good entertainment get movie 
5,i heard i went see movie   once see  others exist    it s true the best part first movies fact jack nicholson played joker  beyond  first movies hold candle film dark  cynical  brutal  wicked   all describe version story  the way batman originally intended  christian bale great job portraying character  this movie actually shows us bruce s transformation hardcore training goes order become superhero know love i got see imax  outstanding   
2,rehashes moral  question vigilantism batman movie  without action laughs  the whole corrupt city saved rich simplistic trite appeal sycophantic libertarian holmes  character totally pointless  bale  obviously talented the machinist   emotionally flat  and great actors caine morgan left sidelines explain emotion explain gadgets i wish i n t seen erases memories keaton bassinger nicholas movie thrills laughs  
2,i disappointed i ordered amazon  i hate widescreen picture cut i specifically ordered i get full screen  i opened movie said full screen front  find dvd inside really widescreen  how could amazon   i wonder re reselling movies  very careless part i would return except i already threw receipt away i assumed amazon would get right  do n t think i ll use amazon 
1,positives christian bale best batman date morgan freeman itnegatives movie start finish  horrible plot  throw couple bat villains poor undeveloped fashion katie holmes fuggly morgan freeman smart movies like this pay point see movie   wait graces rarefied air hbo ll thank change channel underwaterbasketweavingweaveoff200 go sleep la z boy  anything better snooze fest  seriously though n t believe bad movie
4,good film  absorbing  bale holmes good screen chemistry  christopher nolan nailed  as fan comics  i imagine 
4,i felt movie depicted dark knight previous attempts  i thoroughly enjoyed movie probably watch several times 
3,first  great movie now  us issues bluray copies i  try  the minute see fbi warning  press  menu  button  make sure press right menu button  you get movie s menu  not bluray player s menu   that works  times i ve bought three different copies movie   directly amazon com brand new sealed    on third try i bought used  good  condition  still would n t work i started playing buttons discovered trick  for hassle i went  i went   stars  sorry wb  you messed pressing blurays hope helped other stupid issue  great movie great origin story  great acting  music  action   get point 
5,i recently decided start increasing size blu ray collection  mainly getting favorite movies  batman begins far favorite movies amazing retelling batman legend  amazon definitely best price combo get deal  for    re getting blu ray  getting demand rental amazon  i used rental yet  saw pop roku box  movie came days quality could better pros   you get blu ray rental  watch right away you n t beat price  unless get used somewhere it s batman s awesomecons   noneoverall great movie great price  well done amazon 
2,i know bothered limited edition gift set  the extra disk nothing except waste time 
3,stunning image quality box poor  blue box full holes  i n t understand reason  i never saw blu ray box like  veeeery weird 
3,got like buckskinda forgot itbut picture sharp truesounds good wasnt huge fan theprevious batmans awesome
3,look release page  look reviews  i naming flaws movie another scarecrow taking basically backseat ra s al ghoul yeah i like movie much tim burton batman batman begins better sorry   piece s  batman  robin  chris nolan   good director good job 
3,it s good movie  the dark night  much better  not saying n t good i guess i got spoiled watching  the dark night  
3,ok i going rant little i thought movie good action film  batman movie  no they always change things original story  why oh i forget  s artistic license bull someone said makes joker real  like batman real first place  fantasy character  human stuff they left joker way was people still read lines get hidden meanings you make human us get it quit changing  like making raz ghul batmans teacher batman begins how making movie us artistic selves become painter artistic well least cartoons usually stick original story line i said i wanted rant gives chance say i feel producers artistic talent crap 
4,fantastic back film series christian bale cape crusader starting crime  christopher nolan recreates series dark mood almost rivals tim burton s first two batman movies lack flare bravado burton brought films well underlining sense evil gotham s core  nolan meanwhile give sense realism madness city s hero s movie big surprise  i think great back series i hope sequel see batman goes 
5,first every time superhero movie gon marvel  dc   kids always first line go see cause movie rated pg n t mean s kids like n t see know i mean really batman  best  really is batman always dark character anger  wants revenge  whether kill bring justice truly character children look to he s like punisher n t use guns cool gadgets intesions this movie waaay different batman films   george clooney batman  are you kidding me    takes serious movie grown ups  like s blood  nudity  anything else  really look batman film see really much more mature  the whole story and everything  bale rules 
5,i ve followed film s production good  this movie reboot batman franchise  the story treat batfans non batfans alike judging interviews  christian bale taking role seriously  even dedicated father passed away last  this become new embodiment batman bruce wayne juneth everyone   begins   
4,i m batman fan i enjoyed movie lot i thought i ever would  the movie good story fleshed main character better i anticipated  i like n t use popular villains still excellent story  this moody thrilling film something i d recommend fans comics newcomers alike while story good  complex enough give    nor action something brag 
5,i m odd group people the dark knight  christopher nolan bruce wayne well  his batman however  felt little generic  it n t bad  far less interesting bruce wayne  batman begins bruce wayne batman  good thing  it depends really  what like  bruce wayne batman 
5,we movie night sisters new place told great dark night rises  surprise little sis never seen new dark night series  this great time us 
4,i liked batman begins gives in depth description batman became batman  i would reccomend anyone likes comics 
4,this could better included digital copy purchase  they digital copy available vudu last movie kinda sucked 
1,my   year old loves bob  played little  tired quickly  magnets strong enough hold blocks together real pretend play  seriously  every time tries open bob  whole house falls  the blocks light weight wooden block set fun build house  buy bob builder lego set stay away set 
3,my loves magnetic blocks stay together n t topple like plain plastic wooden blocks  unique shapes  square  and loves bob wendy  but s hard get little dormers stay roofs hard get roofs stay wall blocks  re trying build houses shown picture  and see open behind wendy always falling frame  s hard put back together  the blocks trees nice roof pieces n t great  but always playing set  i give  stars overall 
2,we bob toolbox playset  junk   the good thing set get bob wendy  least n t break  if little likes thomas tank engine  buy playsets instead  they much better made ridiculous  they cost bit less   the along bob vehicles nice  larger talking vehicles  junk well  my four year old loves bob builder toys  huge pain design quality shoddy  you need know buy  these toys set feel confident get hours trouble free play  the pieces fall  pieces fit properly  it annoying  kids love 
1,my   year old boy obessed bob builder construction  these blocks junk  the magnets hardly hold bricks together  not enough pieces make anything  very poorly designed  roof pieces stay attached  do n t waste money             
2,my   year old big bob fan  i first heard click bricks  idea  i thought would great toddlers preschoolers  not  only certain areas brick magnetic  n t fit together intuitive way  it s impossible build structures see box using magnetic points anchors  basically re piling plastic bricks top fall slightest touch  that makes pretty frustrating toddler wants something simple opening bob wendy go building  this toy big disappointment  on bright side  play bob wendy figures fisher price house  ve building duplo houses  unless deal frustrated disappointed toddler  i d recommend avoiding sets 
1,i read reviews still bought shed bob builder fan  this stuff really terrible  my wanted build house shown box  n t done you n t build anything  even house  not even magnets hold n t right shape bricks he uses bricks skip s load surely cheaper things skip cart around  also bob builder shed terrible  i super glued together touched  fell apart  the vehicles cast characters a  stuff utter rubbish  get wendy bob e bay 
1,issue  the magnets secure  one piece  yellow sign  came apart magnet fell  either children  age months   months  could choked small magnet issue   the idea magnetic blocks sounded great  after attempting play eith   year little frustrated  i  we could n t build much  he found easiest lay pieces make lines  buildings  it n t leave much room creative play 
5,my got toy second birthday s still playing nearly two years later  when first got hard time building anything  loved bob  wendy figures  went everywhere did lately s building kinds elaborate structures bricks limited fact roofs n t stay  uses ramps decks things  we never tried building stuff box  i n t really say  works   all i know s gotten lot use toy re considering buying another set 
1,my daughter pulled apart  tree trunk  came set tiny magnets inside fell along small plastic parts  she almost four still put  candy  mouth  we ended spending half day getting checked must watch brother make sure swallow magnet  magnet missing   generally rough toys came apart way easily  so children    beware  only let right times  if i n t right child could died 
2,i ve windshield mount months  works  i n t really say i would recommend anyone else as review said  shakes quite bit driving  however  bearable compared real problem  pivot head sturdy  hitting smallest bumps road  even turning  could cause pivot head swivel  leaving psp slanted position the pivot head swivels driving whether i psp docked windshield mount  s issue weight  i adjust position every minutes  exactly safest thing driving 
3,nice product  thing dont like shakes much  cant really watch anything road  arm would smalle maybe wont shake much 
1,this dvd rod stewart the faces in concert total bootleg  the cover ronnie lane band recording concert  this dvd final concert keith richards  i m sick tired companies putting concerts different covers ones already  it s like bait switch  and i number faces fan load bs  and looking rod stewart faces  live in london  dvd dvd featuring keith richards final concert  different cover  and honestly  weakest show faces i ever seen tetsu  you even hear bass dvd  i bootleg dvd s better quality  please put money pocket company  good thing cover yours truly  number one faces freak 
4,i would given  stars audio re mastered  although sounds like would expect s concert  it s great see best country rock bands s live show  tommy aldridge could best double bass drummer time show  for always loved raunch  roll  must collection  i still n t believe version beatles classic taxman   it s cool hear live version jim dandy  raunch n  roll   if black oak  fan leave yearning 
2,this handy device worked nicely trim nose ear hairs aging head  but year frequent use died  until died  i enjoy  it s bit pricey months use 
2,it would nice specified description product fit number different styles bikes  i carbon frame bike n t even close fitting size downtube  it fit aluminum frame bike daughter reason  because cost return  i kept gave away someone standard butted steel frame  i disappointed n t work i wasted money  again  limitations stand included description 
2,i  modern bikes  the frames oversized downtubes  one frame aluminum  high end carbon  the bend stand  hooks around downtube  fit either frame  would recommend someone rides steel frame bicycles  it ideal smaller diameter tubes for modern bikes  product useless 
5,have n t issues size frame  it larger road bike frame fits fine 
3,bought hoping really cheap repair stand  works pretty well  except anything related bottom bracket  bottom stand narrow bike  khs flite  shifts side side sometimes  even hard put bike straight  display stand  seems fine  wish build quality little better  repair stand try something else  unless re really cheap n t mind hassle bike falling  
1,i received stand went try trek fit  fit  put scratched bike    so i m stuck stand likely anything  it s worth returning  i paid   stand shipping   total  it cost   ship back i get   back s said done worth it if plan using trek mountain bike look elsewhere  fit scratch   
4,works  simple product use  must careful nesting bottom bracket make bike stand straight  i hook tube  lift bike slowly move forward i let  that helps rotate stand bottom bracket  need watch carefully nested properly toward hook 
2,these sunlite pyramid bb stands notorious habit shifting bicycle suspending  rendering bike ever slightly angled side another  enough misguided poke send whole mess flying floor i exhibited series vintage modern lightweight road bicycles show wherein stands provided event organizers  i foresight bring chainstay seatstay hook stands  even  best  crank mount stands preference  personal bikes  served purpose intended event  on hand  nearly lost cinelli mash bb shell stands  close calls bikes well i might use emergency  i would rely  neither would i expect vinyl coated hook refrain damaging thin  s era paint job  current era clearcoat  matter 
5,bought years ago local bike shop used hold bike work stand does n t work well sized tube bikes since  hook  small hook rubber came awhile ago  replaced duct tape i n t think i ll ever need buy another since s nothing break fail 
3,  still lot better rock power pop albums around i m mixed action pact  one hand  sloan actually put together album sounds cohesive  they ve tossed beatles obsession navy blues one chord another ac dc aerosmith obsession  courtesy patrick pentland chris murphy  pen nearly songs  even though jay ferguson contributes two tracks    false alarm   best  catchiest  album  but s nothing andrew scott  supplied strongest  piano driven  art rock  tracks previous sloan releases  i think hurts action pact overall  action pact tight slick  having seen live way many times  songs sound lot better live record  personally  i think wearing beatles sleeves better fit 
5,this best album since  one chord another   it s hard find album rocks consistantly  although  n t experiment much used  album keeper  if  the rest life  dose n t get feet movin  pulse racin   nothing  will rest world notice  this canada s best kept secrets  the secrets 
2,i ve spoiled sloan virtuosity earlier albums  different sounds experimentations  still incorporating terrific knack writing melodic memorable tunes  one review i read  outside amazon  said songs cd  gel like sloan album  unit  something  another praiseworthy way expressing thought might say songs sound  i liked different moods  vocals songwriting all members  it kept interested affirmed sloan best bands  around  period  i hope cd s production n t sign band wants go  they re still falling cracks  songs probably intended radio ready  case  n t special  i await next cd   ummm   anxiously 
2,as us fan  i certainly irritated released us i pay  import  this irritation compounded i sat listened album  this bad album  bands would solid effort  i expect sloan  what album lacks variety subtlety  most songs little straightforward  other reviewers commented repetitive guitar riffs lyrics  i agree if big sloan fan  probably  otherwise coin toss 
3,this album straight up guitar driven rock unfortunately  re looking mix band member s different styles  n t find  there s lof mechanical guitar rhythms riffs get highly repetitive  usually tell member s songs apart sound alone  including voice   seems absent many points  andrew n t even song   i was wrong  pretty catchy  patrick always seems pull sleeve in opinion  could challenged little  if wider pallette songs  go back between the bridges pretty together 
5,i heard sloan  i found cd listening station  i felt rocked enough buy   i right  i love every song great guitar work tight vocals  the last track trippy reminds  minute monster magnet song  re mm fan ll hear  in short album awsome then i went back bought two previous albums  pretty together  that mistake  i m glad ve changed sound album  hope continues  their works not cup tea  soft lame no good guitar  etc  in short  nothing special  good hooks if rockin cd   if  buy old albums

1,one would think spending nearly  claimed book claimed courses subject would least carefully edited  what get two looseleafs insert several hundred typed pages replete spelling grammatical errors  and  useable material  paying  thinly veiled manual huckstering numerous software programs either pay internet market center commissions outright  much software buggy  troublesome poorly supported  part much better found elsewhere  same so called course  there much better much less  among numerous worthwhile sources material webonomics  make your site sell  avoid despite imc s shills believe rave reviews 
1,people noted weird presentation looseleaf binders put together yourself other people noted information date other people noted mainly product tried sell buggy software other people noted part package spammer s manual other people noted corey rudl spends time bragging money made anything else they right  program manual dishonesty  badly written poorly edited do n t make corey money i made mistake  think shortly find copy buy

2,i ve followed agatha raisin series since began  it accepted beaton s mysteries somewhat short  mystery  leaving hopefully endearing characters carry interest narratives  as result  harder accept eleven installments  agatha grown character amateur sleuth  in latest novel   agatha raisin love hell   agatha stripped whatever comedic touches initially possessed  in place gentle wryness mushroomed seething hair trigger temper leads awkward outbursts  making unsympathetic heroine  perhaps story meant illustrate pursuit ill fated love affair distort poison s nature  i hope next installment agatha might revert former eccentric  lovable  self  i hope  mystery worthy 
2,i love series would enjoyed much n t full typing errors  i  see anyone else complaining maybe s kindle  did anyone else problem 
1,this last m c  beaton mystery  maybe author burned longer energy set scene  description character got scene  weather like  set makes reader feel s right character   this lack atmosphere setting seems similar lilian jackson braun s latest books  i deal sloppy proofreading  happily  i d sure like help mentally picturing characters moving instead reading mostly dialogue  i agree many reviews s shame agatha developed bit lot humor replaced nastiness  my suggestion anyone read m c  beaton book  either hamish agatha series  start beginning enjoy earlier works 
5,m c  beaton favorite author  i books  i enjoy agatha exploits  please write
4,m c  beaton n t beat cozy mystery agatha raisin much fun  s ish  stout  bearlike eyes  moreover s human  vain  silly  romantic  she s smart sassy independent  love hell another long series agatha mysteries  reads good first ones 
4,i bit put beginning poor quality dvd  picture seemed grainy  the theater dark saw little orchestra conductor  but singers warmed  impressed voices  donizetti s music  always melodic close eyes  back soar  the audience enthusiastic applause  prolonged ovations  leonora visibly moved tears ovation arias  the cast excellant  choreography ballet scene superb  i slightly disappointed set direction quality filming dvd 
4,yes  great performance  music beautiful quality dvd leaves lot desired  image blurry times looked washed intrusion prompter times drove anger  spite everything i glad i saw performance added collection just joy hearing cossotto  kraus raimondi prime worth price item warts  i highly recommend it if opera lover ll enjoy rarely performed opera 
3,i bought recently watched  the picture quality horrible  you see anyone orchestra since picture dark grainy  the sound surprisingly excellent stereo  the orchestra good  the singing top notch although bruscantini far expectations  cossotto pleasure young raimondi made look old terrific  but makes dvd good buy opportunity hear see alfredo kraus  one top tenors lifetime best opera  only graininess darkness picture brings rating three 
4,by far best recording i seen  donizetti s famous operas  alfredo kraus sings especially fine fernando 
1,the journal monk  matthew perry  preserved  translated  chopped  some pieces placed book publication  disjointed  obscure many instances almost impossible read without reference library close hand  the illustrated chronicles   chore comprehend little reward effort  advertised kind entertaining historical memoir  anything  not definetely 
2,beware album  s pretty much pop boring spectrum forgettable melodies thin  lyrically  there traditionally rooted tracks exhibit rich  emotional harmonies inventive beats responsible rise african music  n t justify purchase there s probably several hundred pop titles bear much weight fluffy  definitely light party  if makes someone s desert island collection  i d rather drown  
5,five faces darkness almost good original movie  while lacking print quality original  excellent content  appearences trypticon amoung others  interesting dearest fans  it s  origen  many interesting stories  although cinematic masterpiece longer published  i wish  watched  ajauasataian  awesome transformer makes appearance 
4,this five faces of darkness  five part third season premier original transformers tv show  if grew back  like  already seen back day  if n t  re new g1 shows  ok essential enjoying the transformers  the movie  the f h e  video episodes available rent local   years  years  since s likely available  check    better yet  go    check ctlp get episodes vhs many video traders sellers many g1 episodes tape  that s i episodes i wanted n t released rhino video yet

1,what happened  i thought first two classics plain  good   robocop s fight samurai toward ok  save movie terrible  if something real entertaining pick die hard  james bond films  terminator films first two robocop films  they worth time money 
1,the first second robocop films great  i loved over the top action humor elements films robocop  pure  unadulterated disaster  first  way tame  pg rating       second   plot  completely ruined introduction  cute little kid computer whiz  character  travesty  third  movie actually boring  boring robocop movie  i could go  bother they dare put garbage dvd

1,whoa   a flying robocop strings attached  no way  bombs  and s peter weller  the dude is robocop    cheesy movies i handle  s going moldy  time robocop iii catch wave  see yah 
2,there reason make another movie series  i guess still action figures sold  in pg  less  boy  start  well   years  evil ocp still trying tame detroit build bigger badder cop  now japanese taken ocp robo twin triplets  for partrd feature badnd  least see townsfolk putting resistance  i m giving little credit new acting faces recognized today  although peter weller wisely n t back role murphy watch rip torn  cch pounder  mako  stephen root  bradley whitford jill hennessy 
2,robocop    last nail coffin robocop film franchise  b movie director fred dekker tones violence adds lot campy humor film get pg rating  peter weller bailed series robert john burke cast robocop  officer lewis  nancy allen  tragically killed evil ocp officer  robocop takes sides people kicked homes ocp build delta city old detroit  the film even camped throwing robo ninja movie  basil poledouris returned give us real robocop music score  robocop  mish mash serious drama campy comedy  robocop  borrows  pimp s car chase bad guys  even best intentions  robocop  still failure 
1,robocop  worst possible movie series  while first second great humour quite gory action sequenses third installment n t got critsism corporate world plot movie simply rubbish the film made kids flying robocop makes wan cry i gave star basil poledouris great theme back first film 
4,robocop  n t nearly unintentionally comical i hoped  instead  s pretty similar original robocop  updated movie technics make picture effects least appear better  even though storytelling cheesy always was one thing cheesy ending robocop finds ability fly  it extremely funny watching fly around city taking bad guys the amount action pretty good  far enjoyment area concerned  as storytelling aspect  well  little girl entered scene beginning showed parents getting shoved bus  never seen  the little girl  s computer genius  becomes friends robocop if liked first robocop  i believe ll much  there s plenty humor well  mostly words robocop says  just forget  flying robocop  near 
2,robocop  great  great sci fi action film  famous mostly s extreme graphicness  rated r robocop   manages   graphic robocop  you tell try controversial   kid lord  holds gun baby s head  rated r robocop   new actor  robocop learns fly   almost blood entire film  rated pg1 what     happened  
2,after high quality first two films s way go   downhill fast this film put plain simply pants  a crappy japanese cyborg created new nemesis robocop   looks exactly like human a piss take first two films rolled  disaster   ignore film 
1,this movie must made pilot series followed  this would explain lack wit social commentary well toning violence  this movie serious continuity problem  nobody seems noticed first two movies robocop  yetrd movie flashbacks daughter  this truly bad sequel 
2,ocp plans on destroying detroit to build delta city  but  when a gang of angered residents decide to fight ocp back  problems immediately begin  to add to the problems  robocop  played here by robert john burke  joins the people in their quest for freedom  not as violent as the first two movies  and it s also not as good  the biggest mistake they made with this movie was to replace peter weller as robocop  robert john burke just seems lost as robocop  this series was seriously starting to run out of steam toward this point  why could n t they just keep this one on the shelf  anyway  another big mistake they made was to have ann  robo s partner from the first two movies  get killed  has a few good action sequences  but it s seriously lacking the entertainment that came with the first two movies  if you still have n t seen this but you wan na see it  rent this  but do n t buy this  followed by four direct to video movies

3,i would recommend book year olds  i liked book message tells never giving  i gave  stars boring confusing parts  i loved 
4,great book  however re using eclipseuml seems widely used  it would nice written program mind  also would nice converted american english  some analagies hard understand re familiar brittish colloquialisms  also  author uses textio class outputs  why use system classes  seems unnecessary extra level confusion beginners 
2,the problem lies cd player  if listening quiet music  overbearing noise unit  weather bad bearing poor design  it sounds metallic nature  i tried two independent units exhibited metallic rubbing noise  if listen loud music  good  if listen classical  etc  stay away

5,after tromatic plane crash island somewhere cuba  spirited tromaville citizens find harsh reality guerilla warfare  it short period time battle life death begins troma s ultimate masterpieces  if like troma  interesting plot  plain bloodbath  troma s  though best troma film  still worth getting  unfortunately  n t measure wonderfully black standards terror firmer   could  it still amazing film  good storyline 
2,i must say  even troma  pretty bad  a plane crash leaves tourists stranded tropical island happens home base group nasty terrorists  now  think troma  would you work plot  needless say  many dead ends  i thought limit amount blood guts could put movie  smear woman s breasts  untill i saw  war   the movie rather low quality  like newer troma releases  like classic troma  n t get classic  not kiddies 
3,you must remove trained cinematic eyes replace pair specially designed troma viewing  the opening scene killed  i thought funny may reason enough therapy  either way music  girl crying  dead bodies everywhere black preacher s speach made helluvan opening scene  the film ok next  hour  really takes scenes  lotsa killing cool characters it really bad film  i said s quite bit redeemable humor scattered throughout  i recommend renting buying 
4,one tromas best movies besides the epic toxic avenger  the best part the movie besides blood guts was the guy who was airborne  killing everyone wearing their ears  timeless classic 
5,troma s war different kind troma movie  sure  s violent  dumb  good way   good   but s action movie instead horror comedy  troma famous  it s pretty much non stop exciting  violent  action packed  they n t make like anymore  unfortunately  also  watching i felt like i watching lost entry rambo series  maybe sequel commando  it s like rambo commando  done troma style  i d say action either rest rambo series  i recommend troma s war re fan troma movies  violent shoot  action movies  you n t disappointed 
2,a shoot group air crash survivors stranded desert island this ragtag bunch soon find fighting terrorists bent taking united states aids virus made creators toxic avenger frequently tastless flick combines violent action totally deadpan comedy two versions r rated directors cut directors cut way gore r rated

1,oh dear  disappointment  diana ackerman spends much time pointless shots  looking river  admiring photos childhood  produced nova series seriously misses mark  too little science  much irrelevant material  while certainly connect art human experience scientific knowledge brain works  series n t successfully  if hoping reveal wonder senses students  buy series  unfortunately  i ordered affiliated store amazon n t answer queries whether how i return 
2,this series disappointment  the narrator  diane ackerman  apparently author right  gives disjointed  rambling discussion five senses  bits science  interviews actual research scientists  ackerman  joined rather arbitrary examples senses involved various cultural activities  ackerman s examples often bit stretch  monologues full distractingly florid language  kind new age postmodern pseudo anthropological view science knows far senses  i believe ackerman trying convey sensuality delivery  i found increasingly annoyed throaty yet girlish voice  heavy make up  grating self involvement  there much enough science  there far better nova series  i m sure better programs five senses  i n t recommend series 
2,i purchased book idea might teach something new  i mistaken  if already basic photoshop knowledge  may book  i returned money would better invested elsewhere  if idea begin digital artwork  i would recommend taking look  this novice  intermediate advanced user 
5,this truly exciting music  played passion  arrangement explores little known slavik eastern european music  the ensemble cello piano faultless richness cello sound  played testore  makes album memorable  karen kaderavek  already well established cellist  go far 
4,bjork might somewhat acquired taste  even n t like admit completely original unlike artist  bjork always ahead time  not songs post blew mind ones  hyperballad especially  make album favorites  become bjork fan  always wow non bjorkers wonderful voice melodic weirdness    plus  bjork adorable  i love seeing interviews hear talk   
4,bjork shows album post   tha tshe s following comercial way  the song creative cd mixture joy meditation she finds inspiration texts personality her voice miracle
2,this collection tunes experiment rock  i m loving björk s vocals  though over produced inch life  this lp eclectic eclectic  post seems effort please mainstream goons  the lp feels forced 
3,good disc  doubt  hardly worthly surfeit accolades received  post market product  made for the rave material  calculated quirky accessible time  idea bjork boldly ventured new territory  even broken new ground  absurd  re fan ll satisfied post  ll find wondering fuss  good reason  
2,i bought cd simply i spent teenage years listening sugarcubes  i loved the sugarcubes  i m quite disappointed though cause n t sound like  i mean sure songs bjork s trademark singing voice  style music rather boring  the song i like  army me   the rest filler  sorry bjork i m digging solo career 
2,i bought cd basis rave reviews  after first listening  i bored could n t see fuss  after listening another  times  i found album even less interesting  what i expecting excitement artistry  say  early streissand albums  bjork turned disappointment  her vocal technique so so  lyrics largely insipid  obviously  many people like work   member minority  music n t much  maybe listening times  i finally see light  but  seem lot used copies album  maybe listeners giving trying recoup lost money 
4,as much i enjoy work  front back easily favorite album  the music colorful cover   army of me  nearly industrial pop   hyperballad  sounds like   it s oh so quiet   maybe popular song ever  sounds like came right broadway musical  two highlights  possibly maybe   usually puts trance   i miss you   wonderfully wacky  much like s video  newcomers first grab  greatest hits      post   
4,this album mix really great songs  bad ones  army me  decent song  allow bjork use amazingly expressive voice  makes good  hyperballad best bjork song ever  song got hooked  the modern things good  incredible  it s oh so quiet awesome  great change pace  enjoy decent  sounds like song homogenic vespertine  you ve been flirting again bores death every time  i usually skip  isobel rocks  good beat melody  possibly maybe rocks  falls short hyperballad best lyrics album  i miss embarrasment  along worst bjork music video i ve ever seen  the band kicks  saves little  cover pretty boring  headphones cool listen headphones on overall best bjork album  buy hyperballad  it s oh so quiet  isobel 
5,  post  bjork s outstanding effort date  much anticipated follow success previous release  debut     post  emerged new different experiments sound  the magical blend dance beats strong classical instruments like violins cellos  sets artist apart others  the powerful tracks album  extremely versatile  resembling big band  orchestral pieces  funky techno rhythms yet bjork  with extraordinary vocal talents  almost would n t matter say thankful grace poetry lyrics  bjork like album true musical experience 
2,i m big bjork fan  i m big fan higher fidelity dvd audio format remastered cd sound  although remasters atrocious   i thought disc great buy however i n t pleased find cd audio side n t play car computer s recognized cd audio disc  apparently uncommon dual discs   frustrating lack true dvd audio using mlp  meridian lossless  superior dolby dts surround sound provided  interestingly computer happy read dvd side reports surround sound dolby dts claimed  if looking superior audio thought disc offered  ll need happy playing dvd player  disappointing  i already videos dvd  i n t taken consideration review 
4,a challenging record s worth effort   army me    isobel  favorites big band arrangements trademark mysterious weirdness make stylistically diverse 
4,  army me  supernova exploding  letting fragments bjork s pure creative force galaxy album  it produces beautiful chaos  
1,i ve tried get artist i  i would rather listen hours someone s fingernails chalkboard passes bjork s voice  avoid unless like hear howl 
1,i listened c d  back  i almost went deaf cd awful chick sing  album freaky  scary  i could barely get whole cd  if i could give zero stars i would  i never heard kind music s like music catergory  if freaky  different stuff probably like  songs outer space sound weird noises  i n t know i recommend like except anything bjork 
5,on wonderful album ll find strong powerful songs  starting whit opening track  army  powerful song whit strong lyric  may little scary björk strong confident the next song hyper ballad sweet strange song  whit powerful lyric  and last ll find possible maybe strong song björk really shows powerful voice

5,granville barker s prefaces shakespeare highly regarded first written theatrical  opposed literary  point view  this approach pays particularly high dividends dealing  ws s least appreciated plays   i currently appearing production nyc  small role   jan kott  describing  troilus cressida  s  called  amazing modern   cymbeline  s  seems strikingly post modern  granville barker  writing s  accurately describes features play speak strongly highly collage like contemporary approach art  highly recommended  arden edition play  probably charming arden editions  
1,this book took almost two weeks receive  not mention i finally get copy mail  i disappointed see play skipped act ii act v very disappointing 
4,cymbeline later shakespeare plays rarely staged probably even rarely read  the plot elements familiar several earlier works many characters borrow familiar characters plays well  nevertheless  cymbeline rewarding play either view read  the arden version i recently read useful footnotes focused various usages interpretations language time i found distracting finally chose ignore  the play familiar elements appeal read better known works  cymbeline revolves around layered plot includes devices mistaken identity  evil deception  unbridled ambition political intrigue  it rather long play  acts scenes  having benefit seeing well staged would enhance reader s experience 
3,this shakespeare s lesser known plays  i still n t read  that s i got  soon i shall read  so 
3,this probably outdated misleading arden editions  nosworthy really n t like play dismisses experiment leading _the tempest  even editing text affected reading play  only scholars know something shakespeare venture 
1,this version play missing acts iii iv act iv  scene contains famous lines shakespeare   fear heat sun    so  need play  crunched time  need supplement research paper stream of consciousness mrs dalloway   i would definitely get another version  thanks lot complete rip

5,we bought radio looking number table radios various price points  the radio shipped quickly  arrived original packaging  we paid circa   set up incredibly easy  directions quite user friendly  straightforward  setting preset stations  dual alarm times simple  out box installed  playing may taken minutes  although set number local stations  use boston acoustics radio exclusively playing xm satellite radio  audiovisions  inhouse incar pioneer satellite radio  the sound quality crystal clear  stunning  the bass nicely presented without overbearing  we wondered lack tone controls total non issue since sound well balanced  rich  we could spent brands  sound quality radio stunning  would strongly recommend  
5,i wanted kitchen radio  alarm function important  great sound i could hear throughout fairly large apartment radio delighting  i considered looked bose higher end boston acoustic radios feel consumer reports spot rating best buy  table top radio  i wary warnings bass muffling spoken voice  since i mostly listen npr  i m problem 
3,the cd packaging give original year release  elsewhere confusion whether inner life s second third album  it  however  best release  lead singer jocelyn brown forefront mix  strong recognizable track even author track   pay girl    the original album starts ends ballads  first especially good torch song  contains three good dance tunes   ai n t no mountain     let s go another round     let s get this thing together   latter previously unreleased bonus track   while i never thought version ashford simpson classic  ai n t no mountain high enough  definitive  tracks grow memorable repeated listening  as album  whole holds together well home good extended track padded filler material  it better disco long plays 
3,it arrived today  n t used yet  it seems include everything i school days journal  ends grade   the i childhood went high school  i expecting  if plan child s journal grade   perfect  however  plan continue high school  keep looking  i ordered two two children go pre school grade

2,william bradford s of plymouth plantation perhaps boring vexatious book i ever read  the plain style employed bradford  undoubtably  puritan backgroud  still excuse tedious often archaic redition events  i think high school text book would give lively presentation life  new jerusalem   bradford calls  the antidiluvian vocabulary monotonous recording events made difficult book get  i would recommend peers
3,this book  firsthand accounts written plymouth colony i read both languageth century shakespeare  therefore hard read comprehension  first time william bradford wrote book many years fact  covers period time separatists left england holland  holland america  settlement plymouth colony first decades 
3,this beautifully designed radio well thought out  intuitive controls  it pleasure look use  however  boomy  unnatural bass range disappointment relatively high end radio  at price point  surely might expect  accurate bass sound  least tone control  we might well returned read reviewer s suggestion stuff port cotton  reduced boom tolerable level

4,we neighborhood discussion group based book  us coming different spiritual affiliations  i heard neighbors saying fresh perspective since mostly hear secular pychological views  so  ready new perspective  i figured step like step alcoholics included spiritual view  i sure author meaning bate switch  simply trying appeal masses affiliations different levels understanding trying offer something different people consider  it dramatically helped 
1,i bought barnes noble  i n t reviews guide purchase while i realize irony writing angry review anger management  book  i little peeved i i bought   first  regular psychology section  i read back  read table contents  first pages  no where mention christian book  i felt pretty stupid i got home started reading evils pornography living hedonistic lifestyle contributing anger problems   what    next time i ll read  author  section  revealed s written christian counselor   whoops just thought i d give others heads re buying  case flip hurry like i  discover reading bible versus makes more angry  would counter intuitive  
2,there information summary information amazon  information cover book  tell christian oriented program  i like separate psychology spirituality  i looking something use clients may may christian  it many biblical quotes refers innate inborn sinful nature cause anger  it says anger management linked spiritual stability 
4,the anger workbook excellent tool use groupswhere persons anger problems  this could used inrecovery groups  prisons  large organizations angeris problem  i enthusistically recommend

1,when i purchased book  i read fine print  there labeling whatsoever book fundamentally christian based  the indicator fine print back cover  people would probably see purchasing book  the reasons anger in depth easily relate anyone s life  however  solutions everyone  if fundamental christian  book interpreted insulting  everyone lives life thinking everything do think feel say based authors may call     i wish i would read reviews prior purchasing book 
4,very good information  very revealing find anger issues buried deep inside  christian based 
5,a friend suggested book  i gained whole new insight issues i dealing life  this book helped put lot life experiences perspective helped understand others much better  even n t think anger issues  i n t  definitely impact effective understanding anger s complexities  a must read  
1,i excited reading book text back information listed cover advised i would find answers dealing anger ways counter anger within  i dismayed find book uses bible help resolve issues without going greater detail within book  i understand christian viewpoint considered helpful  disappointed book makes reference christian viewpoint back book  there brief reference acknowledgements christian integrity printing  hardly sufficient notification prior purchasing reading book  unless looking book christian agenda dealing anger i would advise pass book 
1,i bought book help understand someone i feel anger problems  after two chapters  i determined would help decided keep reading  hoping would get better  for  book posed many causes anger  never propose specific solutions  a lot theories substance  i quit page  i able tolerate abundance religious context  dr carter put forth proposition criminal behavior result environment rather free choice  i closed book forever 
1,if book s based religion  psychology practical ways deal anger  i expecting   book may  if  like  book deals anger psychological behavioural stand point  look elsewhere   like   may angered biblical god lord references book find better suited kindling recycle   time go find real  book topic   
3,i pretty much second reader california wrote  if christian  i think really like book  if n t  n t buy 
2,not best workbook i seen  it interactive either  it lot references religion 
1,there nothing title cover indicate book whose sole intention convert christianity the first two pages anger  page three told jesus loves you sad  religious people feel need deceive others order get message 
1,i ordered book i thought would helpful work troubled adolescents non denominational residential treatment center  boy i wrong  it seems like s page without numerous references bible passages  i could n t even make sense authors trying say connnecting points stories bible  this book useless work i n t even return  it made very clear description book written from a christian perspective  all minirth meier clinic series books label caution 
1,this book professes people  fact  devoutly religious  i could finish faith based  made sick stomach  maybe people give control lives god  i  i n t think reason anger sins  previous reviewer written  i think book deceptive  nowhere cover mention book try get give anger god let  exactly book tells  it total waste money 
1,deceptive  book strong religious content  it assumes reader strong reliance god solve his her anger issues 
1,as thought christians ones get angry   or though  work anger constructively  ought become christian   this book serves put many readers s failure inclusive 
1,book christians christian  use work illegal foster christian beliefs residential clients  disappointed noted nowhere christian based  feel ripped

4,i turned minirth meier series due familiarity  i intentionally chose book christian counselors  while even book bit trite times  ability force self examination helpful  through examples  questions  do react following ways  type checklists i able see clearly  see damage i family  it helped identify emotional  triggers  find realistic ways manage forsee situations might set  contrary reviews  i would characterize approach simply  give god   no  carter minirth squarely placed responsibility change feet belongs  helped see begin making change 
2,as person recently realized problem quiet anger i heartened find book  the description back cover seemed describe good methodology work anger management first chapter encouraging however  quickly became evident lot religious content book cases counterproductive  not us simply believe god made need faith press on there lot good material book  however  progressing third way i simply could n t religious references leaps faith authors used dilute promising way handling anger an actively practicing chrisian would probably find book helpful  anyone else keep looking 
2,i started reading unexpectedly came across religious christian context  it putting  plus book little dated copyright s

3,this book released australia last year  unlike lessing books  i found unremarkable  overall  reminded angst free the four gated city   favourite lessing read   compared the four gated city   instead island west    coast britain  get impoverished aids ravaged africa  the african setting characters stark contrast well nourished middle class london characters  affecting 
3,structured two sections set london africa  the sweetest dream interesting chronicle turmoil western ideology post world war  lessing bitterly attacks dogmatic views communism justice held leaderships soon forgotten rose power  instead  heroines women  julia  frances  silvia  whose political positions defined rise circumstances provide support around  the section set africa particularly intense vivid  on hand  plotwise story meanders much often loses focus  specially s part  i got feeling novel would improved better editing

5,i really enjoyed  i n t know reviewers coming calling biased  i see  morris appear fan ben gurion  give lot attention israeli massacres lebanon  he emotionalism book recounting facts history  this book build particular side another issue  it good book learn actual history though 
4,benny morris rose forefront israel s new historians  s publication birth palestinian refugee problem   provided radically new evidence altered modern perceptions region forever  morris retains important findings righteous victims expands  covering virtually entire history israel palestine conflict  i found earlier chapters leading creation state israel earliest zionist settlers particularly interesting  morris presents picture indicates current bloodshed means product natural necessity  the ethnic cleansing palestine subsequent military occupation cause  however  morris becomes overly ideological concluding sections book  allowing harsh realist politics creep  nevertheless  arguably comprehensive single volume history conflict

4,first  i say i n t like disco music  well  i ve bought album i n t think i ve made mistake  i must admit i n t agree  body language  freddie  thinking    besides under pressure  put fire las palabras amor  songs real good stuff  back chat life real  moreover  everybody admit songs skunky disco stuff  lot hidden good rock 
3,do n t believe bad press album  okay  s thier best  n t experimented disco  good songs ie  put fire  life real  under pressure  las palabras de amor  action day it  still worth money folks 
3,when queen working album trying something new  like u pop  but results quite good  but good songs  los palabras de amor  the words of love  under pressure  life is real  cool cat put out the fire  the rest forgettable  if new queen  buy a night at the opera a day at the races 
4,please  safety  dont listen album without listening queen queenii  that might ruin impression gretest band world  this album exceptionally bad turns right around becomes good  these songs horribly un queenlike  rolling around floor laughing  now ll excuse  going dance around room staying power  
1,queen loved experiment  every time released new song  i would hear say  delight    is queen   however  album abandoned rock roll gave pop craze disco classified dark ages pop music  the bright spot album  under pressure   thankfully  pulled cement greatest rock bands time 
2,i can t tell disappointed bought album back  since musical landscape changed bit it s still pretty bad opinion  worst tunes staying power  action day  body language  some songs quite agreeable like back chat  sounds bit like diana ross s  upside     las palabras  nice ballad under pressure still great number originally written greatest hits album   therefore sounds like stranger record 
1,let s  hot space filled filler  but love queen  i indubitably  ll find several splendid touches  but go mining   rather explode  great queen incomparably  we must denial admit album weak gruel  good moments floating  but queen  even bad queen pleasures 
1,i m shocked good reviews i m seeing  i m huge queen fan  since  day races wonderful  the game classic  night at opera quirky  still good listen  but hot space atrociously bad  let repeat  atrociously bad  it sounds like somebody fooling around drum machine n t realize recorded  it s bad karaoke nightmare admittedly  yes  under pressure great song  but could n t possibly place unless included megadeth cd  really  s bad  am i making clear   
3,hot space usually criticised queen fans pop  electronic  this true large extent  cheesy sounds stop listening gems album contains  everyone knows under pressure   notable tracks include las palabras de amor   great ballad   put out the fire   calling all girls   rocky little numbers  i would recommend album queen fans prepared give try  n t regret buying cope cheesy songs 
3,this queen i stand listen beginning   ok flash gordon worse  i n t count real queen album   it sounds like let success  another bites dust  go head  drenched synth pop  luckly songs like  put fire     under pressure  save album bad 
1,just stick rock  no experimentation please  that s queen s music  queen  zeppelin  the doors  jethrotull   rock  party bud  funk 
2,there little recommend album anyone true die hard queen fan  it laborous disconnected  the  hits  came good plentiful enough justify completed work
4,hot space n t bad people say  it weakest queen album point n t desearve bashing got  staying power backchat quite good  on second side good songs action day  life real  coolcat  words love  classic pressure  i feel body language ok  worst single mistake queen ever put  i n t think queen ever recovered mistake america  radio stations n t anything queen single  despite alot great s music queen  if new queen fan n t place start  save album later  open mind music ll realize s lots interesting fun music heard 
4,queen played new sounds  the result entertaining record  however much called hard fans criticized 
2,what say  does n t even sound like queen places  a bit much disco  there couple good songs though  but least liked queen album apart flash gordon sound track 
2,like great rock groups made several albums together queen misfires  hot space misfire  after excellent the game provided queen major disco style hit another one bites the dust queen decided would make album largly steeped dance disco sound songs good  this album fails exception songs approach life is real  under pressure  los polabras de amor  calling girls put out the fire 
1,i big queen fan  cd worst ever  why put instead taking sabbatical beyond   the decent songs under presuure  even live versions tend put studio shame  put out the fire  maybe life is real could saved bonfire well  the partially spanish sung las palabras amor pretty silly  i spanish always found appalling knack foreign artists try record language lyrics lose lot sound silly all  buy consider queen fan  unless re blind faith kind  notrecommendable  you ll find cringing often listen  
4,queen moves forward dance rave scene times s  it s bad considering  just n t expect heavy rock early queen  it s enjoyable  freddie s  song lennon     put fire     calling all girls    under pressure  among best  remember  mediocre queen album still better queen album even mediocre queen album better bands could dream producing 
4,i know  i read reviews album well thought album probably going embarracement queen i would feel embarraced listening  however  purchasing  queen live bowl  dvd  upon hearing  action this day     back chat    staying power  mind changed rapidly  i went buy hot space never looked back  it s favourite queen albums  if love queen  ll love album much others  sure  queen experimented new sounds  opinion bad thing  do n t think certain people n t like s slightly different  n t consider getting 
3,originally released  queen s official follow up s the game  lp i remember album first came  would appear many long time fans lost interest queen i know summer trek u s indeed last tour here this effort really n t bad s album rock lp best track  hands awesome  put out the fire   also decent lp s single  body language   straight ahead rocker  action this day  memorable collaboration david bowie  under pressure   enjoy 
3,if re used love queen s greatest hits i ii familiar queen s well known classic stuff  cd might  its heavy disco n t really sound like queen much  there good songs like put fire song lennon interesting good  looking buy original queen album  d skip get something like night opera 
4,hot space style queen albums  tried style  see s success  not succesful thought  good album  songs like staying power  action this day  put out the fire others may called worthless  cause n t  let s see i rate songs  staying power  dancer  back chat  body language  action this day  put out the fire  life is real  calling all girls  las palabras de amor  cool cat  under pressure    i know greatest hit album  i n t like that much  that s review album keep on rocking   
2,queen s  hot space  different classic excellent albums s  the overall approach pop rock  the opening  staying power  pop disco pumping bass horns  kind declaration expect time queen  regardless musical style  queen talented class quality whether s heavy metal pop  on album john deacon s bass plays major role behalf bran may s guitar even i would prefer guitar oriented album  freddy mercury sings good always  the melody groove usually songs like  back chat  good indeed  but course s couple tunes i n t think stand former heights  the closing number  under pressure  duet david bowie regard songs album falls kind natural 
1,queen could got away piece junk under pressure disc  why  because listen song realize  simple comparison  bad tunes       even ballads    not mention dreadful opening track  staying power  this album unsincere attempt queen go disc make money  of course fans say  tried new approach     experimented new ground        this bad cd great band  there hundreds cases like  
2,i really think rest band n t think much album  there three good songs  under pressure  las palabras de amor back chat  the songs forgettable
