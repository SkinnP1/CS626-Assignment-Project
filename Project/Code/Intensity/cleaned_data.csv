3,overall  player works great fairly easy set  however  display ugly  orange lettering reminds alarm clock  displays minutes  seconds  also  lack universal remote drawback  finally  i disappointed learn record vcr sp   hr  ep   hour  speeds  maybe standard  i ve always liked lp mode taping movies could fit two tape  this stuff may seem trivial  anyway  s two cents 
2,i began incorrect disc problems i ve read  the vcr still works  hte dvd side useless  i understand dvd players sometimes quit  even year  to s sign bad quality  i m giving jvc well  i m sticking sony giving another brand shot

3,this fine unit dvd playback  lot great features  but experience vcr side left lot desired  the machine saddled sub par tuner makes noisy  color smeared vhs recordings  playback factory pre records n t great either  i say ep recordings n t fall much quality wise sp  although frequency response speeds pretty atrocious   jvc brags s inventor vhs    shame could n t better

2,to read book need fully awake full concentration  this type book bring beach  though richard hofstadter makes convincing case colonial times like obviously scholar  writes monotonously  thouroughly interested american history would recommend book  otherwise  history fanatic  book gives wide range perspectives fully covers history time 
4,as previous two singles sorely overlooked body language set  minogue manages go something light years away many consider given forte   straight dance music  it s shame singles album modest success  album even less   this another first rate track  probably best album  though i must say re recorded single version dwarfs comparison magnificent album version  may considered  commercial  enough radio the remixes fine  bonus track  city games   rumored original choice album s title track  much  video lovely  unfortunately  looks last single bl  i suspect not so distant future witness return disco dance kylie  ca n t get you out of my head  beat pulsing far behind 
3,  chocolate  best song ms minogue s body language album  single gives truncated version  it s shorter  added effects  it looses lot flow makes album version memorable  the bonus track   city games  nothing noteworthy   chocolate  remixes dimishish orginal song  the live version  love at first sight  alright  kylie great listen live  on positive side  enhanced video stylish  that reason buy single

2,if watch movie couple meets  falls love  gets married  almost breaks  fights  get angry  make  new problems  lie  hurt  almost break  really break  cry  yell  cry  finally make s really anything else  movie you if  reason  decide watch  watch point get married then turn it off  bollywood  thats length regular movie anyway  
3,some beautiful scenery early nice romantic sequences somehow degraded onto worst aspects couple bickering lack generosity srk character  his bad behaviour movie really doesnt much redeeming feature something i like hang  the movie ends reconciliation bickering do n t learn   indian movies  they either dysfunctional  relationship use by  date i usually like two actors dvd i decided hang onto even though i quite srk  not favorite 
3,boy meets girl  boy falls love  girl already engaged another  boy chases girl across world try woo  girl loves boy  they live happily ever  that s first minutes movie  and ve ever seen bollywood movie  know s least   hours left  so fill  bickering  mindless arguing continues nearly every minute movie  the movie fine first time   though fighting  hours seemed like  years    i ll probably never watch  on list great  good  terrible bollywood movies low good  but good see shah rukh khan rani  they re wonderful

5,my kids love little critter books  exception  great  year old  even  year old isnt bored much  he enjoys reading little brother bedtime 
2,my children i love little critter books  this great book  bound well  the book fell cover within days recieving 
4,i really enjoyed ms feehan s dark series  eager read new book  this true gothic enough paranormal elements help build relationship hero heroine  nicoletta special  gifts  entire village tries keep secret  however  presence gifts draws don scarletti  he  gifts   nicoletta n t immediately enchanted idea marriage don  unlike authors  use  i hate   temper tantrum ignite passion main characters  ms feehan uses empathy sensitivity characters achieve  the love scenes wonderful  though plentiful  so re looking amount intensity love scenes dark books  may dissappointed  i read sitting could n t put  the story riveting 
2,before i begin  let say i absolutely love dark series  those books great  this potential  fell flat  her characters simply n t developed enough time relate  this effort decent usual standards 
3,i would enjoyed hero powers able read minds  way s good it or able read minds betraying trying kill  new bride  when plot seems trouble way read thoughts  and heroine distressed  trouble  who questions ability s married  and keeps getting trouble n t tell anything  keeps patting head telling worry  protect  which n t well  the plot long times boring  i hope ms feehan stays paranormal charactars 
3,as avid reader christine feehan  i pretty excited  scarletti curse  published  unfortunately  novel live expectations  unlike feehan s earlier novels  characters well developed  plot relatively shallow  there flashes feehan s characteristic imagination  disappointing read 
2,this book major disappointment  it missing special spark made ms feehan s novels  especially dark desire  something special  i found book little action  little romance   mystery  plot never mysterious suspenseful  this definitely book i pass friends family read 
2,this book great potential live  i hope goes back writing  dark series  books  this book needed action editing  way long amount plot    
3,this great book  but dialogue nicoletta guardian seem drag forever  i missed intense dialogue feehan usually devotes two leads  it seemed little interaction except last  book  why devotion mother daughter relationship n t seem lead anything crucial within story  it really detracted couple s story  other  two leads great i agree previous entrys  please write book brothers 
2,really disappointed book  the ones wrote good dull  rushed put new book n t time make interesting  would still read books writes would n t read 
2,i first found christine feehan s work dark prince   it excellent read hooked whole series  i thought book would  even close  the scarlatti curse humdrum  before i reached halfway i really n t characters  the secondary characters underdeveloped main characters two dimensional  i get feeling period place  in short seemed like short story plot enlarged advantage success carpathian series  please christine n t write like 
3,i read     goes somewhat w dark series i n t gotten far enough recognize names yet 
3,this book bit different perhaps historical setting  it started well  soon tired italien phrases   madre    zia  that got really annoying  also  hero violent cagey first suddenly got tender mushy towards  it disconcerting  ms feehan seems preference characters dark hair eyes  i need little variety  please  ms feehan writes main female characters fight desperately independence throughtout book  knowing brooding  possessive hero  i get tired constant whining carrying  but seems females go magical personality transformation first sex scene  i know sex good   overall  i liked story even bog places  hated main female s  nicoletta  reminds stop cigarette smoking commercials 
4,though i still favor carpathian series i really enjoyed book  christine feehan still kept supernatural writing made book stand others write mystery romance  her still wonderfully stubborn  know get  her women stories still head strong  whiny give challenge  i recommend book anyone  i finished  days  now lets get back carpathian series  wets appetite christine feehan books    
2,first  let say  i d heard i might find dark series christine feehan s cup tea unknown reason  thought series  need tell  i severely disappointed  confused  this book really reminded romances mother used read back s  blech  lots dark male broodiness  written heroines point view  course s young innocent virgin _____________edited add  i really wish i given star  appears i n t change 
5,this keep  wonderfull story plot  full dialogue main characters sizzling romance  the plot keeps turning pages wanting  once excellent author 
5,book great like christine feehan s books  holds interest every turn bitter  know perpetrator bitter end it held edge seat see nicoletta going seriously hurt killed scarletti brides 
5,my favorite time   giovanni intrigued soo much   felt love nicoletta soo much envied her well written  good work christine
3,this book read little much like toned book dark series really enjoy  like series hero laboring dark shadow needs special woman make life light  he protective dictatorial woman n t help  the fact curse healed little pop psychology help book either  it still pleasurable read i wanted repeat 
3,i realtively new christine feehan  really enjoyed  dark  series  this first gothic novel i ve read quite time  i must say book diverting  favorites feehan  i n t find nicoletta sympathetic  there lot minor characters many names reader keep straight also  nicoletta s supernatural powers explained pretty well  never really gets understand giovanni  from but  said  creepy certainly kept reading  i still thinking book morning i woke  s something  while i would n t recommend book best  certainly entertaining read 
2,i really like christine feehan  this book dissapointing  the plot promise  nicoletta sweet heroine  the prose good  medival italy setting interesting change pace  however  plot flows like molasses january  i managed get half way i book went back dark  series 
3,1  the camera esay use  simple makes great use anytime   the camera stylish heavy   for connecting pc s easy works great   price great  expensive   disappointment  the pictures really pixeled clear  even close distances  even still shots  n t clear  i m sure related pixela program  also i import movie sound makes hard even make minute movie  edit sound movie together unison in conclusion  the important thing missing  clear picture  this reason many us bought  to capture smile  laugh  action loved 
5,i love  great quality camera alot stuff  it even hooks computer lets alot stuff  i edit videos copy even stream video like web great  works well winxp  i bought amazon got quickly even super saver shipping lowest price i could find free bag ask 
4,this great camera  i older sony camera i used dazzle bring video pc  when i heard camera usb steaming i excited  the quality images really poor  it produces blocky mpeg movie  there post processing time pixella converts movie mpeg  dazzle usb brings movies faster post processing time  produces mpeg movie  dazzle pushes video usb uses sound card bring sound  this contrast usb streaming pushs video sound usb  i guess architecture  video bitrate must lower shared sound thus produces lower quality image other  camera excellent 
2,i ve camcorder  hoping able use usb streaming feature make small computer movies send friends family overseas  although camcorder good included software weak usb streaming makes choppy poor quality avi file  i recently got new computer could find device driver disk came camcorder  sony technical support joke ended trying sell driver camcorder  so i camcorder i plug tv record onto vhs  do people still use vhs   dreams i putting something computer fading fast  i m going find new way send parents video i took new house frankly day age analogue camcorder waste money 
3,i ve two  lasted year  both malfunction tapes jamming camera  i talked repair shop  see lot sonys design  using purchased movie software able make good movies pc  burn dvd  using pixela software included could capture still shots  good enough listing things ebay  etc   novelty 
3,this great camera  we use lot  i love night shot  steady shot works great lot nice features  everything works great time  the light metering auto focus work well too there problem really frustrates  it right left microphone records stereo  way get stereo playback analog a v output  that s certainly cheapest things i ve seen products i ve bought  it s disapointing like sony 
4,the picture camera good needs little light  however  colors quite accurate i hoped hi  perhaps digital would better  price factor  i shopped around found amazon best price available 
2,i bought new   the color pretty good  the resolution poor  close shot get satified  other get blur edge barrel distortion sometimes  i n t use lot first  years  last  years i used regularly tape daughter s piano class homework every  weeks   minutes time  recently i knock camera extremly hard several times make recording start  it s common issue piano teacher told me   so i find new camcorder  i n t know i refuses work day daughter s piano class 
5,this great book anybody wants understand bar codes  work  prepare cost benefit analysis implement bar codes  even called using bar codes distribution  relevant applications there redundancies book would need fixed reeddition  also would nice reedition done since dates technology evolved much  but still  even without improvements great book 
2,we purchased bag vacation taking cruise wanted use left ship  the bag convenient carry  however faux leather began peeling  at first n t bad became annoying began flaking skin clothes  i would rather bag cloth bag flaking faux leather i keep wisking away skin clothes 
4,cruel unusual first patricia cornwell book i got read i loved i n t wait read books boyfriend told patricia cornwell books said i need read hornet s nest southern cross next two book i reading i reading new ipad i got christmas i n t wait keep great writing patricia thanks boyfriend telling awesome writer       rksbabydoll
5,received book promptly great condition  thank amazon opportunity buy used books 
3,this novel good plot decent characterisation  it s gory  gory  twists turns plot make difficult put  in addition  fact love interest makes refreshingly different  no  no love interest  somewhat qualified reading novel   centrality aunt niece relationship sub plot adds value  opinion if like crime fiction  novel coroner main character narrator would appeal  try book 
3,first say first book read pc  i ready dive new author  story awesome  plot thickened  people knew getting killed id blame  looked   the killer who  wasnt introduced book  felt poor ending disappointed read dunit  understand reason jennifer heath ben      lot loose ends thought  going read another thenmake judgement writer nailbiting last  pages  lucy seems like whiney brat 
1,i listened audio version  cruel  unusual  recent trip new jersey back  the first   book kept edge seat    whole thing collapsed heap  would much better author stuck writing taut thriller instead trying drag everything evil republican office holders nazi criminals  dumped mix last possible moment  after buildup     whodunnit ends   nobody particular  and fate evildoer  nothin  much  disappointing  wo n t bother dr scarpetta ms cornwall again i m little baffled reviews say   great book  bad ending    still give  stars  is n t mystery defined ending  author ties loose ends red herrings 
4,i really liked book  it page turner sure  i would read i went bed force find stopping point  if ending written differently i would given  stars  still fun read 
3,mark s dead      since kay s lost found love  i guess i would expected two paragraph explanation happened  i assume kay new love interest future book  let s hope fairs better mark did why kay move  how quit smoking  ex smoker  i would interested reading withdrawal symptoms medical examiner   any reconciliation attempts marino wife  how many people hack kay s files  is usual me s position many people against after  i n t recall quincy much trouble   the story line good  the medical portions morbidly interesting  good thing   i miss human element  kay gave reader reaction abby s death previous novel death  mark  loved hated adult life 
2,my first foray writer latest book  scarpetta  i enjoyed   so i purchased effort several others written  i bit disheartened find books basically formula character studies  after reading work becomes less stimulating  it becomes trite 
3,the characters wooden much innuendo whose relationship  my first scarpetta novel  trace  i wanted go back read earlier  a fan recommended  but i still found characters particularly likeable  i n t stand lucy the plot excellent forensic evidence pieces flawless  but many holes unconnected dots  and whole plot changes killer  killing people scarpetta getting accusations  i found ending somewhat disappointing  enough clear focus waddell exactly going  all focus case scarpetta 
5,cruel unusual another wonderful story ms cornwell  it graphic detail i stayed rivited  i read everything writes  none boring knowledge investigative procedures adds thrills stories 
4,cornwall great author book starts great plot  just interest might slipping  story builds
4,the first  book  cornwell sets perfect novel  albeit rather drab  reactive protagonist  suddenly swerves road goes bonkers  for peak book kay scarpetta threatened governor suspended job  cornwell finds way tie great  believable plot  things  nazi criminal  s totally lost  then s absolutely climax showdown whatsoever  we hear acts murderer second hand  big letdown 
4,follow work  a superb next series  skipped  great plot although i thought came together neatly conclusion  the author s ingenuity thought processes made cornwell dr scarpetta reading buddies  you love novel forensics mysteries thrill  i guarantee enjoy entire series 
5,i love reading books i read past  i going back starting beginning reading order 
5,if enjoy medical thrillers  enjoy book  it evident cornwell research subject  gain useful information read 
1,in word  lacking  her style writing left unable appreciate underlying story  result  i found rather vacuous inauthentic  so much i felt compelled write review book others might avoid making mistake i  no offence patricia 
3,i m audio book fan  i prefer unabridge abridge story n t flow  all sudden area jump another second  downloading ipod  tracks three disk n t download  in times publisher play games lazy chuck
3,the book much better  the abridgement much took much away story never got sense characters  it like set make specific length hacked away could give plot synopsis  i gave book    
4,like ones  book solid forensic police procedural  a death row inmate executed fingerprint later shows current crime scene  how could happened  i particularly enjoyed seeing kay s niece  lucy   person  longer child  lucy s computer skills continue amaze  i look forward reading next series   note  there continuing bad guy introduced book appears next two installments well  i d recommend reading book the body farm from potter s field 
4,patricia cornwell clearly well researched writer  she really knows stuff comes forensics  this ability reflected character kay scarpetta  medical examiner  i kept reading order find links among deaths robyn naismith  eddie heath  susan  jennifer deighton  most questions answered  i felt way much forensic evidence liking  really enjoy book 
5,cruel uinusalpatricia excellent writter i love books  sometimes leaves bit flat ending book
2,the good  the basic plot line interesting killed electric chair finger print turn murder scene  the writing good  the main character kay scarpetta old professor well fleshed out the bad  other characters well fleshed   the plot never fully explains  is book figuring dead criminal could commit crimes  scarpetta  redeeming eyes everyone around  developing anti social workaholic tendency death loved  the latter seems path author choose  leaving twist plot unresolved  though others story made scarpetta villain  many different levels  family member  friend professional  goodness  redeemed  how bad guys story turn seems unimportant  i found major flaw 
5,i really liked book  it page turner sure  i would read i went bed force find stopping point i think patricia cornwell prime novel 
3,a king honoring nobleman  yet accuser comes forward accuses nobleman murder  the accuser put jail  they plan execute accuser  the king supporter  crooked abbot  plots accuser  a ghost murder victim appears somehow explain injustice leads accuser thought involved sorcery  that book nut shell  a medieval murder trial  not usual ann radcliffe book interesting i recommend 
4,i enjoyed funny people  n t typical silly comedy abundance lately  the film much serious silly good performances sense reality truth throughout story  sandler leaves goofy bag home lets character become likeable interesting person  the film avoids many pitfalls films leaves satisfied wanting types films  if re looking insightful film good laughs  ll probably like funny people  re looking usual sandler shtick  might pass 
1,this movie not funny  excruciatingly boring  i think adam channeling aristocrats  whilst aristocrats funny thought  still better garbage 
1,entertaining places spoilt lots crudeness dirty talk degrades woman  in i found nothing memorable funny film  sad adam seem trashy film 
2,this movie perhaps adam sandler s worst effort  he seemed tasked burden playing apathetic  came across apathetic role  the result performance never engaged viewers pull  made climax film lackluster  it occasionally funny  considering title cast comedians  played comedians  the last minutes  film changes pace entirely  n t floundering enough  drops attempts weak comedy push even weaker drama  despite big names cameo appearances  real stand leslie mann  plays sandler s ex  she lively force cast  sadly  alone n t enough bring back focus  you re missing thing 
1,i used enjoy sandler s movies   jeez  put  well  unfunny all characters stupid  shallow egotistical   do n t dramatic  supposed  misogynistic prick persona worst ever  just  n t watch  really   you ll minutes life back 
1,i known going movie judd apatow part would mean i would hate  however  adam sandler seeing previews theater gave  hopeful  chance  the movie loses s true premise depth amongst terrible  crude  jokes   i say n t make minutes movie turning  it constant barrage pathetic behavior  i n t believe many people like relate behavior  very disappointing 
2,this typical adam sandler movie  necessarily bad thing  kind  first s funny  it s  comedy  i would n t consider movie comedy  although funny things i suppose  this movie seems like s place  it long runtime doesnt really accomplish much  some people might like story  pretty dull 
5,i stand up fanatic  i enjoy alternative comedians culture cultivating ny la lately  i consume content stand ups like c k  cross  tompkins  glass  jeselnik  ansari  posehn  miller  holmes to  if lean way comedy preferences review likely applicable you i love movie  you must go knowing expect i e  n t assume know movie feeling knocked  the characters hilarious struggles actors superb  great director  great cast  hell perspective alternative comedy lastly  buy collector s edition  the bonus features endless  if film brings consequently reflect negatively  worry  second disc right  just read disc content ll sold  enough said 
2,adam sadler plays unlikable comedian  george simmons  finds may terminal aml tries experimental  he decides stand meets comedian wanna be ira wright  seth rogen  attempting stand up  sadler impressed ira hires write jokes personal go fer  ira finds illness convinces george tell family friends  george plays death card patch relationships  suddenly n t going anymore  george re examines life  even mid life still immature a hole  everyone sex ira  seems sad joke i found jokes humor best  lame  the language crude sexual  brief nudity  perhaps best movie makes sit coms look really lame  if think guy saying  tweet   spinning around circle funny  movie 
4,this far judd apatow s underrated movie  i think people went expecting typical apatow fare  disappointed realized filmmaker s mature efforts  the film share laughs  well moments sincere drama  just put mindset  ll really enjoy movie 
2,too bad adam sandler could given better script  funny people starts promise jim carrey man moon type film drifts oddly sort romantic comedy repetitive c k jokes  there two movies made seems like two first drafts  maybe marketing problem  or  maybe lazy writing  sandler great job showing dark side comedian  maybe funny people would better straight drama 
2,wow  i usually like adam sandler  judd apatow seth rogen films came left theaters i could get chance see  i n t think i laughed entire movie  not even chuckle  it seems fun making film  the unnecessary top crudeness apatow s ensemble n t seem work sandler s schtick  i loved  knocked up    year old virgin  n t seem bee much chemistry group  i waiting  bruno  show throw unnecessary genital conversation  i almost bought  i m glad i rented 
3,what pretty good movie  but seea unfunny adam sandlers  get  i think adam might going inthe right direction serious acting  calling movie funnypeople  expect movie funny seth rogen quite character  friends add characterto movie  but  felt like finished tv movie without commercials   so  good  keeper 
3,too many dick jokes long  but like entourage  interesting see life like celebrity  we always think people rich famous clearly  s true 
1,i seriously expect dramatic look mind comedian i rented movie  they marketed movie like forty year old virigin knocked up  when i rented movie i expected lot humour many funny actors i put way much faith  my wife i disappointed stopped watching  i n t watch lot tv  i watch something i worth while if re artsy films serious life people spotlight  re going like film  however  re looking humour like adam sandler s previous films  i e  happy gilmore  etc  forget it i give film star kind movie advertised like great comedy film drama film   
1,this worst movies i seen  the dialogue awful  there zero humor  all characters boring completely humorless what loser movie             
3,i guess i look sandlers movies bit better fell short some funny overall i found lacking 
1,anything adam sandler supposed funny  this however   well  n t  i really believe movie potential  much going  many stories within story  could made  movies it it s  half hours long  that s hour half long main story plot  this movie honestly seemed longer titanic  gone with the wind long drawn out there little humor funny people  the good thing major stars pop  probably  opinion least  movie even made big screen n t go straight dvd 
1,a truly great example  terrible movies become   vulgar   offensive  unnessisary nudity   i usually love adam sandler  n t believe d stoop low role  seth highly likeable  still swears lowers well  the woman plays adams romantic interest  mostly great  stoops swearing  blantant sexuality  the writing worst movie  this awful movie  hours minutes long  feels like  hours   and i could spent life something interesting exciting like watching paint dry grass grow  i suggest skipping movie altogether   tragic movies gone  much lost   scott macneil  comedian 
1,honestly hear lot swearing wont like  let alone story line ridiculous  would n t recommend 
1,i normally love sandler s movies horrible  none flowed right  jokes horrible vand stupid around made sense  do n t waste time money 
1,i must say i never liked adam sandler  there many talented people never got chance screen  i still n t get s adam sandler besides i decided give shot  it took half hour i stopped watching 
1,how anybody even smile kind garbage adam sandler always performs  this guy moronic retard do not waste your money on him 
4,i big fan judd apatow s work  went hearing like movies  somber  serious tone  expectations tempered  i liked  agree reviewers probably little long  i star  but go knowing isnt year old virgin knocked style comedy wont disappointed  said  see people rated poorly thats thought going see going 
1,this movie original concept  the jokes lame  performances  the writer director disappointed audience using adam sandler  seth rogen jonah hill box office draw  when fact  n t worth money see film theatre 
1,save money  your time much better spent  this worse movies i ever sat  actually  i drifted away close thankful i n t waste time  its awful 
1,not worth time pros  several good one liners  introduced new comedianscons  excess foul language  adultry 
4,i prepared disappointed  wasting another  hours life yet another cookie cutter hollywood product  the movie  half hour long  quite entertaining  making feel privy inner workings strange world hollywood  it well written  funny  immature  least immature actions characters  felt real rather scripted  overall  strong addition recent good  mature comedies coming hollywood  i thinking forgetting sarah marshall  hall pass  etc 
5,this wonderful graphic novel beautiful illustrations  interesting story set different culture  i fan graphic novels  convinced  like opera  enhance experience using fusion art forms  i highly recommend

1,this could worst novel i ever read  it first last patricia cornwell novel i ever read  there many problems book listed  three points   the main character  kay scarpetta  insufferable  humorless snob  i d never read novel i hated main character  great job  pat    about  novel dialogue  very bad dialogue  but understandable since cornwell write prose    the story predictable boring  ending utterly ridiculous  i m astonished book ever published  let alone made bestseller lists 
2,i never read author  knew many  when i read book made movie  seemed good opportunity read  seeing screen mess work  now  i pray screen so i extremely disappointed work  it unrealistic  fails capture reader  points i completely engrossed  left struggling whether i wanted pick  i hope written better  else  lot people bothered reading strong authors available her characters sympathetic  draw reader s attention  dull overall scope  i many good books read i pick another book author 
3,do n t let first quarter book discourage  i thought slow  cliched i almost ditched  would leave handbag read train work i really bored  but i kept reading train  i realized eventually  i could put  i know would happen next  good mysteries  i ended reading train night home  i know happended  great mystery main character  medical examiner  scapetta   important i read book  someone credibility happens

4,for first book i read author keeps interest give lot forensic pathology describing going 
5,prepare keep lights tonight re reading  from potter s field   enter dark  even sometimes humorous  world dr kay scarpetta  mystery solving sleuth n t expect  marino better watch job suspense terror reign  potter s field  well suprise intrigue  we encounter evil temple gault seek identity latest victim  its like mixing horror mystery getting best worlds  if n t read book hardcover  pick paperback  unless  course  chicken 
3,reading book reminds books written  cornwell excellent writer needs remember change characters  we lead slowly path inevitable outcome  the twist book sister looks like  it s good read
2,having read patricia cornwell s books  i disappointed latest achievment  draging villain  separate books probably n t best idea  even disturbing  the characters main heros  scarpetta  marino  lucie  described inconsistent previous books
5,not spell binding others series still good  it took getting last couple chapters understand title  minor  i found alot typos book  usually minor ones completely wrong  correct next sentence  i stop second think   who  ok   amazon com find next 
5,book amazing  around exciting book  scarpetta definetly meets expectations  roller coster emotions  couldnt put book  re read book numerous times 
3,i really enjoyed story writing much  i got  the events bring us climax intriguing shocking  grisly  warning anyone familiar cornwell   the interpersonal relationships among  good guys    kay  benton  marino  janet lucy  added texture enhanced suspense  and i enjoyed moving virginia new york hilton head kay  but ending  so much action brings us unsatisfying climax  throughout book  hear least two characters muse villain behaves  this made hear definitive answer  and never get  the book ends abruptly  would think ms cornwell simply ran paper 
3,having read six cornwell s novels i say n t presented momentum irony books  the first fourth book excellent  ending disappointing wonder even bothered foreshadowing  i enjoyed book  could better 
5,it magnificent  i picked border s bookstore  dollars see  ever since i ve read i ve stuck books  it great little gory parts wonderful storyline plot  i would highly recommend anyone loves mysteries 
3,i enjoyed much particularly written skills describing characters crime scenes  however  i convinced ending since explain temple gault challenging dr scarpetta  perhaps book adolescent develops emotional attachment kay would interesting 
3,mystery novels books i read worst book i ve read year  i expecting ms cornwell 
2,i expected better poorly contrived story murder mystery well seasoned author  the plot line lacked substance ending poorly executed  the reason i continued reading story hopes would improve i read  boy  i disappointed 
4,i read almost patricia cornwell s series kay scarpetta liked books  probably enjoy book well  it feel others except i find adultery kay continues commit inconsistent strict sense right wrong  marino always great character easily picture mind i found scene police morgue particularly good  the ending bit let  however  i m still hooked continue read books 
1,this book unrealistic spoils fun  super killers like temple gault  clone satan incarnate known hannibal lecter  silly super  i found character two dimensional  intrigue  regarding super computers insulting intelligence  has cornwell done better  i n t know  reading  big hurry find 
3,most story could guessed unless deaf  dumb blind really shocked story ended still bad little book  i would recommend  i still like dr kay even time 
3,i listened tape version  pretty good getting beach  etc  there strong narrative drive carries along  however  text read highlights lack  tightness  good editing could fixed  also  please n t tell us gault worst murderer century  show us  prove  my personal quibble heroine talking woman s father asks daughter dead  kay answers flat yes  s got hunch identity dead woman  this inconceivable forensic pathologist whose specialty knows  prove  i d probably listen another scarpetta book tape  i got library 
3,the first  story held interest  in last pages seemed miss cornwell ran steam  it let s get this done anti climatic aire  i expected thrilling pursuit subways new york  complete frustrating near misses near successes  instead  get bad guy comes straight heroine  temporarily captures heroine    thwarted heroine disabled  pages 
2,this first patricia cornwell book i read  she compelling storyteller  obviously possesses great knowledge subject matter  i admit finishing book two day period  get inevitable final showdown scarpetta killer  scarpetta cronies characterized well  killer seemed bit stereotypical  i n t believe reading ahead spoiling surprise  case i skipped detailed sections find killer would stopped tracks since reading book  i read cause death cornwell would rate book slightly higher  this book best i ve read far  would n t prevent reading another one this good  focused  knowledgable writer need fall back unbelievable killers sensantional plot devices tell imaginative story 
3,i really book hard time putting  but left totally unstatisfied  i felt rushed really left closure  almost like pages misssing book would compliment story  it author faced constraints time space  great story line   bad ending 
1,at least  s i felt book  seems published author written truly interesting previous novels  i recommend first three books series  i recommend book anything except kindling  however  fireplace  i filed g 
2,i found plot contrived many scenes clearly made become vicariously involved  the twists turns plot simply convenient appreciate sense natural flow good novels must  for example  the scene gault  killer  seen using restaurant main character spontaneously finds  imagine  new york less  not  killer using main characters visa restaurant  and genius software engineer niece happens working huge computer program law enforcement field  i m sorry  unbelievable  it might make passable b grade film  i would n t see 
4,the scarpetta s better adventures  temple brooks gault  serial killer released prison  cruel  unusual  plays mind games scarpetta nypd ny transit police woman s body discovered park  the twisty plot worth re read  especially ending pits gault scarpetta geniuse niece  lucy  subway tunnels new york 
5,i love kay scarpetta series  s i got hooked whole forensics stuff  patricia cornwell excellent author 
4,this first cornwell book  i enjoyed characters story i look forward reading scarpetta  marino  benton company  the action fluid i never sure gault  killer  going turn next cornwell detailed lends credibility plot circumstances  the events gruesome  coroner reading  expected  cornwell exhaust reader gore made subject matter easier handle the criticism i story moved fast i felt i sometimes missing something  i think i get used cornwell s writing style  i maybe started series chronological order  nonetheless  satisfying read  i would recommend cornwell series others  worthy  stars 
5,adermatt grabbed attention beginning kept  she tells extremely poignant relevant story i felt i watching every minute real life  i hope beginning series 
3,i little disappointed  though i enjoyed john s humour always  decided lack coloured art  i remember purchasing  bloom county  book cartoons back s  large portions book colour  but reverse true  there illuminated sketches  great majority book black white  half fun mr mcpherson s work witnessing funny pictures  lack colour interfers  i would like publishers  part book description  include accounting amount percentage hued work 
1,noisy  crude five point vibration pad not  massager  vibration pad  we purchased three sent back three  worthless   worse worthless 
1,the authors seem unaware fact theory guides understanding  there  objective  facts  yet authors present findings almost reasoning attached  this arrogant ignorant  the authors display grasp theoretical advances accounting i recommend getting book better exposition principles practice

4,  lincoln reconsidered  david donaldhistory always interest  this takes bit time expands nicely  it starts nice introdution lincoln times  people knew worked  goes onto politics  it anecdotes never see anywhere else  it turns linoln rabid emancipationist  pratical president things needed done  i wondered freed slaves states rebellion  alienate slaveholders kentucky maryland  i still mystified reason northern aggression  slavery seem inclusive answer mythology makes  book shows altenative reasons  stand  collection essays 
4,you get full text edition free      information costly  hopefully read review 
3,i native speaker problem understanding popular books economy  not  i still struggling style i fully judge content yet in opinion  author writes general public  book intended  i assume  try simpify writing style and reason i gave  stars 
5,hazlitt presents clear  concise lesson basic economics  his message well articulated well supported  this must read every person ever worked voted  planning either  discusses essentials economic theory politics put theory practice unfortunately  erroneous ideas book  hazlitt occasionally makes claims implies government make interventions economy  seems think capitalism s merit lies service  common good   however  fallacies rare  significantly detract book for great back to back lesson economics base  read book followed capitalism  the unknown ideal ayn rand 
3,this interesting read reflects perspective author title   economics one lesson     
3,i n t finished book  i perceived written years years ago  fit global eco circumstance  and expression straightforward  i ll keep going  aspects get idea people understand economy  thank 
2,if new economics  book skip  it useful  mandatory reading  looking understand subject better  there even chart graph included book    stick naked economics  undressing dismal science economics dummies two titles serve better 
3,the value book depends expect  i bought book i get good idea basic economics general government economic policies  but book essentially goes picking government policy another  like tax cuts  protection industries  price fixations  minimum wage etc  goes telling us artificial measures right economy general left free market forces as  book kind disappointment  meeting requirements  though i say  contents book quite good generally enlightening 
2,when i read something i like whole story facts back  i got book guy side politics giving opinion  although many policies i tend agree  i really hard time reading something entire book  well  i got around third way  swung way direction  if like reading someone s opinion ll love book  re like like cold hard facts leaving making opinion  n t buy book 
3,this book seems political pamphlet  way  i like narrative approach though  too much anger government i guess  analysis please  reader draw conclusions 
3,the book good person n t studied economics  it reflects libertarian philosophy low taxes self sufficiency 
2,i read s  non event back  like books claim  answer   book gives enormously over simplified view economics reflect real world  moreover  presents settled many open questions  claiming authors opinions facts  there many better books free market economics  far  far better books economics general 
2,i expecting book economics  maybe i might understand market forces  pe ratios  stuff like that it s big argument libertarian government  not even particularly good arguments either  re based metaphors  like broken window  paraphrased memory   even though may get paid  community get rich fixing broken windows  that holds community still  push forward  that s fine argument  s teaching  metaphors mental manipulation   give pros cons let decide  or better  give damn facts and s outdated  the book years old  we not post wwii economics 
3,mr hazlitt good points offer  two things diminishing  much content dated  written half century ago  dwelt certain issues far much detail  i disappointed 
3,if someone argue keynes  book  i know enough know economic stimulus recession considered reasonable many   economists 
5,sure  specific examples cited years ago longer relevant today  basic lessons absolutely permanently valid need ever understood least majority voting public the sad fact americans go entire public school system  higher education  without learning first thing economic science  getting bombarded self serving economic propaganda   thus public gullibility fallacies cited hazlitt seems less pervasive back  resultant cancerous growth government economic meddling increased here s revolutionary fantasy  make book required study high school students  imagine would kinds politicians get elected future btw  get nice hard cover edition less cost directly mises institute 
5,for avoided economics like plague  book you very informative  gives novice good foundation subject   check out  next time argue economics uncle fred  wont sound like dope
5,this new book  perhaps s useful there gobblygook  arcane economic theories fancy lables what book many examples   government takes action make happen  unintended consequences proven probably something quite different  usually positive sound experiential economics view  clearly written  tremendous help understanding probably happen nation takes debt  subsidizes interest  taxes interest expense another  etc i liked  i could read understand 
4,why i taught school  an excellent book whose lessons still hold true today  i highly recommend 
5,economics one lesson essentially introduction austrian school economic thought  hazlitt s renowned treatise originally written lauded libertarian stalwarts ron paul  peter schiff lew rockwell among others  while examples provided text may dated book relevant today first written  hazlitt  s perspective  takes many today s controversial issues government spending  taxes  minimum wage  balance trade  unions inflation  in big government  many hazlitt s economic lessons breath fresh air  i highly recommend economics one lesson interested learning austrian school economics basic free market priciples 
1,i s thought would good time remedy i perceived gap education  economics  i never course economics book i read heilbroner s worldly philosophers  satisfying general overview i recall  i probably read heilbroner late s i m audible subscriber got economics one lesson  i say book dated  full economic events referenced wwii  excessively polemical rigid i read time ago made enough bad impression i saw suggestion list around number  i get onto page say terrible disappointment book was i think book retitled  economics one polemic  the shortest surest way understand economics late s s 
1,if faith market forces low taxation reinforced  straightforward  blinkered attempt make forget government regulation  funny west european countries bigger taxation government influence less crime  better education  better health  better tv programmes us  they organise politics better  tax money better spent  it set right two points  parts written spuriously funny way  biased really informing  clearly writer never listened people n t agree with if open mind compare dangerous nonsense writings naomi klein see unfettered capitalism works practice 
4,i read book college  years ago   s basic precepts stuck years  helped reduce complex issues fundamental truths  you n t find details complexities today s problems  help better understand give strong starting point approach  brush aside political bs surrounds  politicians economists all them like surround public positions idealogy  this book help sort core issues  you might still agree ideology  least know depart basics 
5,i know sounds stupid  i know sounds extreme  i know sounds ridiculous but book really did change life i used bleeding heart liberal   government x  y z   this book showed wrong i  how very wrong i was this book mandated reading schools 
5,i laugh negative reviews book  they probably written socialists n t understand economics  otherwise would n t socialists  hazlitt s arguments based   real understanding economics    facts  including socialism abject failure ever tried  in contrast  arguments modern liberals based emotions devoid facts thinking world is i tell best books ever written economics 
4,this book little outdated  little heavy libertarianism  otherwise s easy read  i particularly like stories uses present basic economic ideas 
4,the book extremely cryptic normal readers  i toughest time understanding extremely complicated language book  it would nice made  dummies   i still got  austrian economics needs taught school  period

4,see story summary above no doubt action packed story ll spots england spots mideast  pure action way  if s looking  look  as far details dialogue concerned  little sink teeth  typical higgins novel  though short point  i enjoy books  i would match super hero sean dillon fictitious villian  good escapist fiction quick reading make book enjoyable recommended 
1,as people readers know  jack higgins written many fine action packed books  however  book reads like twelve year old wrote  the characters transparent could ghosts the author publishing house must really need money rip public manner  this last book i read author  one rest laurels long  i m glad book handed i would written really nasty review 
2,this minimalism style writing exposes much reliance characters events previous books little descriptive detail promising locations  the action thin well  characters frequently quickly little build detail  character motivation weak times contributes arid experience predictable climax 
4,taut tense  explosion sequential thrill packed events  hallmarks popular novels springing pen seemingly inexhaustible jack higgins   edge of danger  nd suspense laden powerhouse exception the belfast born author brings us harrowing former ira member  sean dillon  confronted rashid s  english arab family sworn avenge killing russian diplomat driving drunk  when diplomat provided immunity russia america  vengeance sought life american president action swerves throughout world terrifying finale takes place remote castle 
4,sean dillon impishly dances irish jig england  ireland  parts saudi arabia  efficiently wounding killing every bad guy sight drinking bushmill s  saying  higgins put story keeps pages turning  mind working suddenly reaching thinking next offering  heres hoping next good  god bless 
1,where real jack higgins go  this higgin s worst effort date  probably worst book i ve read past  years   can say lazy   jack   i n t believe i actually finished  star generous rating  unbelievable chapter unbelievable chapter  character plot development  written liketh grader the book foretells sequel   book i immediately pass  probably last higgins book without reading reviews first do n t buy  n t borrow  n t read 
2,having read higgins book  cold harbor   i hesitate  somewhat  comment author s general talent  however  book worst i ve read time  i think thing got dialog  unbelievably simplistic totally formulaic   damn  said kate   it s hazar scouts   puhleeze  not even exclamation mark  many examples could given  now  assuming moment dialog  say  written greaterth grade level  plot almost bad  the protagonists  reactions fellows getting knocked one by one almost comic  there s depth  simple vignette another  i would n t even compare ludlum clancy  although clancy s gotten bit rough late  a terrific waste good
1,this book well written leaves nothing imagination  if i n t bought hard cover spent money i would even finished reading 
4,this second higgins novel i reall getting world created author  i learned lot ira ways i find pretty entertaining times little fantastic the story centers around dillon bad boy ira working british  his mission stop family half british half arab bilionaires the action non stop pretty interestng  it s quick read sometime point nothing really deep the compaint i i know dillon little little seeing character character growth 
1,very simplistic writing style said  said  said  said  this reads like first attempt  like book written seasoned author books 
1,i m glad first jack higgins novel  if  would last normally  i forgive higgins cliche s obsessive attention characters  drinking habits  characters fun interesting  he puts great plots pulls reader happily  n t wait find next book especially s got sean dillon but  all characters wooden  the action colorless completely unbelievable  a president guarded secret service agent  a professional assassin whacks target head shoots someone else  there sense timing place  thinnest motivations characters  justification many decisions made characters this book amateur hour  do n t bother  read higgins s earlier works instead 
2,jack higgins may running fascination modern weapons  fine dining  glamorous women ira appears slipping plot character development  sean dillon makes doc savage dirk pitt look like pikers  and curious extension gentlemanly methods attempting kill another  sending crazed assassin sides meeting later savoy exchange notes  strains credulity higgins done first rate work  had published twenty five years ago  might made difference  it n t n t 
1,this far worst effort i ve read  he s favorite spy author  anyway  this book feels like written fulfill publisher s contract obligation mr higgins assumed needed finish hurry  the characters fleshed  story line contrived  i would advise wasting time reading book 
1,i rare experience giving novel couple chapters trying read edge danger recently  higgins managed pen book lame i refused go  his bad guy supposedly scottish arabian aristocrat comes another cartoon arab terrorist implausible  pointless heritage  but  expect middle aged author poses bomber jacket aviator glasses dust jacket    depth 
1,given lack character development  rather  simplistic times contradictory character development  lack plot whatsoever  poor visualizations  i n t believe i read whole book  i guess i kept waiting action start  it never 
1,very books contain review  this   stone said  it really like bad movie  harry     you bleeding well say       this book reads liketh grade reading level condensation outline screenplay  the paragraphs lines long  words greater two syllables used  no complex thoughts  character development  suspense  little description  pure formulaic twaddle 
1,the plot believable  shred character development  n t even descriptive atmosphere  it shocks jack higgins publishers actually make money puerile drivel  i shall buy efforts 
1,the style writing leads believe higgins pressure churn book meet editor s deadline  there character development  critical turns plot action blown without slightest bit suspense  i ve never read higgins likely never read 
3,this fast moving story  lots action superficial details  it great literature  provides light brain candy  lots bodies left lying around people killed various means  shooting  drowning  incineration  torture  falling roof  an arab fanatic  annoyed u s russian oil interests exploiting country  decides high profile assassination  nothing seems work bad guys  british ended wounded the story interesting ending rich woman grudge  biding time  planning spend portions wealth get revenge  it brings mind matilda flanders  wife king william i   spurned saxon nobleman teenager  waited years william conquered england  tracked saxon thrown dungeon 
4,i ve read number reviews  thought hard  this escapism  nothing  nothing less  the dialogue trite cliche  plot formulaic  but makes higgins good  its fun  and sure suspend disbelief occassionally make plot work  s harm  i enjoyed book  it returns higgins back form number less successful books recent years  even inspite cliches plot formulas  distinct grittiness  characters  long due 
1,a terrible  childishly written book absolutely no redeeming value literature  higgins loves  speak irish  even gambit fails trite  poorly plotted  worthless endeavour writer remain retired n t better trashy writing 
2,i purchased book expecting good things  i found plot thin predictable  there little suspense  it almost seemed like abridged version book detail leading left  also n t seem character building background explain individuals would singleminded  surface stupid  behaviour 
1,i n t know worse higgins macnee  the plot tranparent guess coming next  completely implausible  macnee s narration overdone laughable  most time characters little quaff enormous amounts bushmills irish whisky  a real stinker  wayne schwartz  los angeles  ca
2,when read book know reading  true  start read things completely wrong another thing  for example i questions  q  how many times could pay another kill somebody  killer fails boss gives another chance  a  i n t know mob knows least four times q  why target  knows trying kill saw restaurant danger say hello  a  because target likes danger q  when target opportunity kill wanted kill n t  a  because something head n t let even killed many before and energizer rabbit  i keep going going going  advise skip book 
3,everything album written  synth pop extreme  yet s in  back  listening takes strength  s classic  misplaced love  best album  hard find cd  worth getting song alone 
3,i like robbie s material real test live album  do i play regular basis  for example  i listen band s  rock ages  alot cd  good great best describes cd 
1,i bought cd song   steal away   i knew going  live   n t even close radio version  try like  muzik  lounge  sound  it recorded ballroom  then  song i recognized  hot rod hearts    done vegas lounge style  i wish i could get   back  why n t put cd using regular recordings  he never big star begin  i wrote review warn people n t like  live  recordings  i dissapointed  i still n t decent recording  steal away   
5,this book i looking  highly informative information herb along lore magickal uses  it explains deity correspondences points sabbat might use herb  i recommend anyone interested magickal medicinal uses herbs the product came early book excellent condition 
3,this without mistake  among better herbal magic books  however  i originally bought thinking herbal alchemy rather use spells  it many psychological cures many practical ones  you infer magical cures might turn medical ones  and since i mentioned alchemy  turned incense  rather potions elixirs otherwise  good book  especially re witch need use herbs ceremony  ceremony book s specialty  it tell many herbs used funerals  protection  sexual prowess 
4,as reviewers already stated  p beyerl s magical corespondences   seem arbitrary  on hand accord tradition seems ok  but put errors  aside  compendium herbal magick  still good  nicely illustrated  book plenty true informations interesting stories regarding lot herbs  so i think despise errors   correspondences    attributions seems ok   nevertheless pleasant respectable lecture  buy informations  interesting stories nice illustrations sometimes look elsewhere herb s correspondences  i give four stars 
4,yes  need software stream data computer  s well worth  buy others         see think  this real time machine superb  data input depends car s computer data supplies  seems like data provided corvette s computer  hondas  instance  provide minimal information 
3,club rotation cd sets are quite popular in germany and reflect the leatest dance music happening there  this latest edition displays all the hot dance tunes that emerged from the eurpoean continent this summer  some highlights in clude the remake of  tom s diner  and the new classic  the summer  by atb  if you like dance music you should invest in this collection 
2,this book well reviewed i disappointed  even s written poor readers  read like dick jane  children young  simple minded  give kids real literature n t keep reading  ll plug media 
5,a refreshing  sunwarmed  beautifull change frozen steeps plains ice age europe  a delightful story woman must overcome immense odds survive  the plot line moves different ways  woman odds  novels fresh predictable  a good read much better choice jean auel s  shelters stone

3,the story great  i readth grade unable understand well    it wordy complicated overall  great book  it profound public ignominy  definitely classic adults  definitely teens   this masterpiece
3,i read book english class  i enjoy  my favorite genre scifi technthriller  clearly  however  although i force flip next page  analyzed class book amazing  hawthorne considered nothing less pure genius writing  we could easily spend minutes talking single page class  the amount detail hidden information astonishing  so  like love stories   i think considered   book  otherwise  buy tom clany novel 
2,the scarlet letter good long discriptive book  i would n t tell anybody read unless classic books hawthorne fan  this book the house the seven gables based unlying rule hawthorne description  his books would n t long would gotton plot  now n t get wrong plot book good movie even better  if read deal  all i know n t hold attenion long i fell asleep couple times

3,forcing students read novels could considered primary obstacles promoting reading independently pursued hobby  the story  i ll admit  good idea  however  moody overromanticized method telling stifled good idea  hawthorne victim style times  victim bad writing  in short  great book read  miserable book read 
1,i guess i read last review even fact description says landscape  i n t think necessary  s book right  i guess s supposed easier read bed  i thought would cool scarlet letter red book if buy book holding book like wall calendar reading two columns  first two columns top page two columns bottom  this seems really irritating 
4,i found book full text exactly typical high school reader  it mostly date  people n t understand unless fairly good readers as story  i believe beautifully put together  i think great hester  main character  uses way show strong character  the way portrayed remarkable  i believe american literature fan  must read  the reason  stars instead five  vocabulary takes basic skill comprehend 
4,this book is a great classic that exploits the idea that a preacher would do the unthinkable and make a woman pregnant who he was not married to  the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak  i like the candid reality of this book that did not white wash everything completely and the story still makes sense in the modern world  this still happens even to this day  however  this type of behavior is the worst possible outcome and this is an example of what not to do 
3,this book interesting  unfortunately s hard understand  the version i read barnes noble classics  notes nancy stade  it s people deal  what would involved adultery  hester prynne wear scarlet a clothes mark shame  purify   arthur dimmesdale hid secret seven years  tormented guilt  roger chillingsworth lived bitter revengeful life incident  i would recommend book people understand old english  it story good  it talks confessing  consequences  forgiving others   daniel w

5,a great read could easily translated modern situations  the way hawthorne explains thing use sybolism adds much story 
2,the scarlet letter overloaded many superfluous words requires reader sift get actual story  however  strong characters revealed actions hawthorne s descriptions  the story takes placeth century boston puritanical law heavily enforced  a young woman  hester  imprisoned getting pregnant committing adultery  now baby  months old  stand center town shamed whole town  her husband happens town stands scaffold thus story continues dark spiral hidden friendships  revenge  immense guilt   this story historical fiction told years later full symbolism ironies human nature society  the ending rather abrupt hawthorne writing deadline got tired story 
4,i sure book required read high school i know story well  remember details  there much use narrative dialog i hard time first  i say i enjoy book 
5,hawthhone s  the scarlet letter  literature s finest  the attention detail settings  especially thoughs characters chain book  sin  regret  guilt  self punishment  revenge detailed relation extramarital affair resulting pregnancy  the symbolism beautiful  plot tragic  characters engaging  the  scarlet letter  true masterpiece 
2,i avid reader  i read many called  classics   this book plain boring  yawn    i really tried get  i could n t finish  i kept falling asleep  this book contains seriously long sentences  some readers said skip first chapter  i could n t  it seems wrong  if going read book try read  i sorry say  i read scarlet letter   sorry hawthorne    i really  really tried 
3,it fun reading reading years  hawthorne certainly could told story without much embellishment  it interesting compare social mores time tremendous changes occurred since 
4,i loved book i twelve  it tragic really held  however  reread i found i n t like characters much  i guess i lost believe social pressure could make people hide internalize something common child born wedlock  so book still good read  i think mature adult self i n t plot much 
3,i readth grade english interesting  very boring interesting decent work literature 
3, m glad books online free  read anytime s nice read kindle fire hd

5,i required read book english class  s favorite book ve read year   full juicy drama  scandal  humor  book like entertaining spanish soap boring classic novel find  if look boon right eyes  enjoy   
3,on first glance  slim volume would seem something could read quickly  not  the turgid heavy prose over ornamented complicated ye olde new england puritan syntax i suspect even written hawthornes prose never accessible  modern context far spoken english reading like wading treacle  it sweet  cloying ultimately sickening the underlying story simple  universal enough theme span ages  could easily rewritten well modern context it never easy harsh book listed  classic  case i feel i must truthful  this easy enjoyable read  it hard work  to oxymoronic i suppose heaviest light read fattest slim book i encountered read peril 
1,i read book ap english blue book assignment  the word  ugh  summarizes experience this book writtenth century  s belongs  it would n t nearly bad someone modernize language used book  reading  dost thou    dost thou  n t fun however  i highly recommend reading richard armour s sl book  the classics reclassified   
1,i ve bought book  underlined every hint symbolism  found evidence romanticism  followed every quote involving thematic oppositions  noted every example pearl s rebellious nature social alienation  i find positive aspect novel makes hard work feel rewarding  the way novel could give warm feeling i place furnace 
1,i ordered specific isbn no  received different tiny book different appearence different isbn no the picture seen online i received 
1,this novel absolutely awful  although received reviews i feel duty help bring average star level belongs  zero  where begin   perhaps run sentences  failure create significant rising action  flat two dimensional characters   this novel full things bore reader  frustrate well the fatal flaw piece literature inability stay relevant  post modern society really   baby daddies   revelation made  beginning  novel reproduced daily morning television maury  unfortunately  nathaniel hawthorn father literary disaster 
2,so i heard friend comi con  he know much  heard people talking food court  i thought sounded awesome  like read die meets cross the green lantern the crimson crusader  so i order i thought graphic novel  turns  novel  less  graphic   it nothing like i expected  unless shame super power  unlikely  hester puritan lady radioactive spiders even existed  seriously  i n t think  bang     pow     zort   show anywhere book  i almost gave star  roger chillingworth awesome super villain  his physiognomy dead well  like comics  let s us know clear bad guy relate  since bad guy least fits i expect gets  stars 
2,too long  re read remembered much hawthorne s style irritates  there interesting story within takes way long tell 
2,the story simple action  speak  n t really happen final third book  it battle get dry middle  unfortunately story exceptionally easy guessand turns story surprising least on plus side  book gives good glimpse life puritan early american communities strucutres 
3,like people i forced read novel english class  while i enjoy eventually slow beginning  it good plot though great way understand period hawthorne wrote in opinion novel major flaw  metaphors  yes novels employ literary elements yet hawthorne goes board  he give metaphor  give another metaphor thing case n t understand first  flat explain metaphor  after chapters gets tedious continues book  the metaphors difficult understand  yet often give long drawn metaphors may page 
3,daughter brat  abusive puritans really dropped ball came  seriously  ever happen  better beat child let damned devil    story interesting ideas   a  came inside outside  ultimately  way choose answer question  apply answer  make classic   even interesting ideas  n t find good read 
3,i think book ok  the thing i n t like fact n t enough talking amoung characters book  even though i could n t understand words book  i recommend book people like good  challenging book 
4,i thought book excellent piece writing  the symbolism surrounding objects  a   blacken weeds  sign sky make story deep  leave much open interpretation  hawthorne s use details good  his descriptions added much plot setting  mostly symbolism book  i think book definitely  must read   
3,this book boring  only i somewhat interested father roger chillingworth would  the language tad difficult understand  watching movie  demi moore   helped lot  it full metaphors 
1,i yet actually complete novel  it dog gone hard understand  on top  i essay due  tomorrow  is relief  
1,i assigned book i sophomore high school  years ago   i could n t get  cliff notes version help pass test  i found turgid laborious reading i graduated top  high school class  i master s degree  despite academic success  i n t understand book classic  i n t understand hester n t pack pearl stuff  move another town tell everyone widow  that would saved everyone alot grief  especially young readers like 
1,this worst book i ever read  the attempts symbolism bogged unnecessary detail language top even time period  i hurled across room point agitation disgust 
3,this book hook  bad hook  i comprehend grand piece historical literature tad interesting might grab attention  more adultery might work  in conclusion  forced read book like  ok peace hizzle fo shizzle nizzle
1,i usually nothing say good things book i read  but book  s interesting points i n t get  i rather would burn stake read remaining chapter i finish english class  what i deserve  i stood reading book book hand dictionary  i ended reading chapter  times information n t getting  and way author addresses reader  i scream  i m sure s wonderful book message stated back  years afterwards  people seem lose interest  and fact make hs students read book plain homicide  stop the assigning of this book  do n t put your students through torture 
2,this novel widely regarded overrated  the plot interesting  writing style torturous  plot twists predictable  it s typical example preth century bad writing  not say book crap  book certainly 
3,in honesty  book really hard understand  then  i ve never really big fan classics  but i got bored way easily  i honestly thought last thirty forty pages best part 
3,in answer first question  yes i forced read book literature teacher the scarlet letter  whole  metaphor urges experience everyday  consequences indulging ourselves while book may listed historical fiction  i believe romance  it elements  interesting enough historical fiction  boring important criterian   the scarlet letter romance  simply  urge  adultery word  contrary popular belief  grease   personally  i thought scarlet letter mediocre  a book written years ago n t fared well modern day english class  class n t like   i think  written  good book  if mindset set odd century half ago  i probably would appreciated 
4,one ofthe greatest novels literature  the scarlet letter nathaniel hawthorne  tells life vastly different live today  rejecting present permissive lifestyle accustomed  reader entrenched gloom doom puritan society  it exposure law tells wear  think  love  the scarlet letter story law versus human nature  hypocrisy  undeniable passions enlightening refreshing  reader taken adventure fully understands risks living passionately  beyond limits society sets  a novel enjoyed ages  the scarlet letter masterpiece time 
3,the scarlet letter book skips around alot  based mass  adultury affects everyone around ever commited  hester prynne falls love reverand dimmesdale daughter  pearl  the problem hester married  she feels ok love dimmesdale due husbands rumored death  soon husband returns  much alive  yet hidding fact hesters husband  hester forced wear scarlet letter a  a standing adultry  clothes rest life  this book good  yet times get lost much unneeded text  if author much unnessecary text  book would great  nice story line 
5,  the scarlet letter   nathaniel hawthorne book keeping secrets ruin person  a realistic view society treat others  even though many towns people innocent hester many ways  looked worse sinners town  unable touched rest society 
4,much amazement  book placed banned lists several states  it s excellent study devastation caused guilt  although story allude frequently adultery  graphic details would make unsuitable use high school classroom  both illnesses caused guilt good health overcome made clear 
3,i thought book would much better  even thought classic book  it fine 
4,well paced  surprisingly easy follow despite language used  i n t read years  found much palatable adult i teenager  there must lesson somewhere    
1,unless correct size font  difficult time reading book kindle  it set text wrap correctly therefore full line text  next line single word  another full line 
2,it started great plot   actually wrote  it overwritten  takes pages something happens  protagonists hard like  boring  sappy novel written trying imitate victorian prose  there couple twists  main characters morons  underscores little action happen 
2,so   i n t like nathanial hawthorne  i think plot brilliant  i find method telling story annoying  i m afraid n t assertion i back lot concrete examples  s writing gives vague feeling malaise  i find true short stories well  i never bothered novels  but ll read the scarlet letter school anyway  borrow library 
1,i ll admit right front i stupid  i would rather enjoy book instead try find way maze confusing  endless prose hawthorne uses  i found empathizing chillingworth dimmesdale  a book not dissected disscussed understood    it clearly portray thematic structure without resort smokescreen vague symbols word  classic  stamped force people appreciate  yes  heavily thematic full symbolism   meaty   whatever    deep     powerful   dry  slow  boring  even someone  generally enjoys classics  fall asleep  i everytime i tried read book   do not try speed read  this book place high school english course  needs span several years muddle plod thru  try unravle 
3,the scarlet letter good story  long winded  i found book difficult read plot tediously developed opinion  the long introduction excite 
2,i english teacher getting book tough  only nathaniel hawthorne make sex sound boring 
2,hawthornes the scarlet letter okay book  it okay plot okay characters  book teens s  i read book english teacher tell truth graded i would read  the teens today read ancient customs puritan society  if scandalous affairs hester rev  dimmsdale would still best seller  i think book read voluntarily  if thinking reading may need reconsider 
1,i m sure i would able understand vivid descriptions symbolism book much better  hawthorne writing sort moon language  i n t know production narcotics s  i honestly think hawthorne n t natural high know i m saying 
1,this book sux  who cares pearl anyways  someone shoot head boredom   
1,the book boring try read without good look movie first gets easier understand youre class failing every single test teacher gives  then decides explain s going later  it boring i fell asleep everytime i went read 
1,typically  i force read even worst books  class   fun   i think i   i read book     english course  i quickly realized worst books ever  taken lightly  seriously   certainly worthy classic  boring  endless details cares   blah blah blah  terrible  i bored  it might difficultth grader  i would n t read either on hand  brother loved

1,oh  begin  first  i say star rating flattering novel beyond means  the scarlett letter boring pieces junk i ever assigned read  i realize symbolism novel  n t stay awake find  s point  also  really helps hawthorne decides use letter words every sentence  only person i would recommend novel insomnia patient  this ranks right a tale of two cities  another  classic    
1,this boring books ve ever read  unfortunately give hawthorne reading novel  mistake  i d pass  must read school i highly suggest getting summary online 
5,the scarlet letter good book  it would much better though alowed read draw conclusions  how well appreciate book hurry must read pages night making sure remember details may test  read highschool  n t matter  but make sure pick later life ready  draw conclusions instead regurgitating teacher told pass test 
3,having re read book first time two decades  i trouble understanding staple high school literature classes everywhere  it s great book teaching symbolism  foreshadowing themes romantic movement  however  adult  i pretty much found excruciating reading experience  i m talking fact language dense dreary  the things make valuable teaching tool annoying experienced reader  as i reading i kept wanting scream every time hawthorne talked scarlet letter burning  glowing like painful brand  i got already  i put slogging nineteenth century prose i m going challenged little  book longer 
1,this probably confusing worst book i ever read  the author uses incredibly large words constantly use dictionary else likely n t know reading  from point view high school  mostly a s good english  student i would recommend book high school age students  the author needs get point drag pages things important  long setences makes book drag  if i n t read book book report i would put first page two usually i finish every book i start  this book tears difficult  i ask english teacher explain  read book risk  reccommend anyone

4,  the scarlet letter  superior book explodes emotion  passion  love  hatred  crime  hawthorne s choice vocabulary absolutely perfect suit novel  however  like great classics  reader must patient  the story powerful  like iron fist  telling sins adultery  great dimmsedale  character book   keeps hand thy heart   full fierce yet excellent story telling  book must lovers classics american literature
1,this book literally put sleep  i could wake  morning find book  stress finishing assigned reading english class  i mean  sentences lines long  plot  plot  incredibly slow  if author would tell like  drag pages  book would third length  boring  boring  boring 
5,while i copy scarlet letter personal library  s teacher required dover edition  i pleased vendor s delivery  arriving due date  my expressed ease able read  especially class used edition text  thank 
4,the story hester master piece worthy highly commended status  however annotated version really helps reader understand historical references many archaic words 
2,the scarlet letter interesting book  while reading book i filled many feelings  i enjoyed chapters  loathed ones describing characters  i felt hawthorne could told story efficiently described character came onto scene  the book made feel inferior uneducated  i made many trips get dictionary legs got tired  i enjoyed general story line  i could left adjectives behind  pearl favorite character priceless intuition helped read book  i would lost without pearl s hints  i would read book required english teacher  attack dare  
3,scarlet letter sitting bookshelfyrs earlier summer i decided imight well read since considered classic  it pretty good book overall definitely nothing like movie  i hate say  i suffered book  it boring books i ve ever read life  but  i finished thought i decided really good story eventhough book wasslow  but i read unabridged version

4,although rather difficult understand  the scarlet letter incredibly interesting book  hawthorne writes way characters realistic relatable  i finished reading american lit  i admitt i far thirilled idea i found time i gotth chapter i really could n t wait find time read  if like read human nature decsion really determine life around definetly look reading the scarlet letter 
2,yes  i yr old high school kid  but i tell good books bad ones   the scarlet letter    classical   lovers  to concise  novel wordy enjoyable  people say s classic romantic novel  good character developments  good themes ironies  blah blah blah  i  like people  n t judge book checking trap metaphors  leave book  doctor puritanical philosophy   if youre looking entertaining classic  read  huck finn  twain 
2,ok  i first started book i thought dumbest thing i could belive classic   i still n t  after chapters i thought little better thats i gave two stars  also  better books i read school  i still feel little boring hard follow class discussions i understood lot  i still would n t reccommend book anyone
4,i remember good classic i read  i originally read high school many years ago  better second time around 
5,i read book first time high school even i fell love story  yes onld english bog bit  worth  great story line  it s considered old school scandalous

2,this all time boring books  i recommend reading  the introduction incredibly long  incredibly boring  also  n t really sort plot would make book n t put  i personally fell asleep four different times reading book  i much higher expectations book  if looking classic read  i would recommend the count of monte cristo  book 
2,first  found book dull   listen tape  s abbreviated yet still dangerous  boring listen driving  i found   indeed  hawthorne introduces advanced ideas times  writing single mother  well musings women s rights  his obsession victorian themes  deification children  fixation bodily sins  well overdramatization simplification plot equals predictability annoyance reader  while book could probably considered  classic   tolstoy s  anna karenina   better classified carefully crafted literary exercises rather engaging stories 
1,throughout entire book  part brain state wonder  trying imagine anyone could make book scandal   adultery  public shame cowardice dull  to finish book test  accomplished i hate leave things undone there many fine  engaging  interesting novels  age hawthorne s  i n t imagine would slog

2,maybe time i figure plate  i get suction work directions apart  use suction  clean  it may seem simple  harried mother needs details  i disappointed utterly useless  least far stay put dish  i purchased 
2,nearly impossible disassemble cleaning hole water tiny bottom gets hot handle  food takes awhile warm  remains warm minutes most importantly  is this dish bpa free or not  i ve seen listed bpa free lists web  but  nothing package product description deems 
3,looks deceiving  the filling water become messy event  its food compartment arent big  the suction cup effect doent work well all i bought two gave away

1,it illegible  photocopy   it appeared someone took picture every page original  principles science   faxed pictures printer order produce book i returned immediately 
1,why series need much expensive tv shows  especially considering n t even original soundtrack  the first thing i think i think my three sons great music went along show  s missing way over priced version  as much i love my three sons  i wait original version released reasonable price i buy 
1,the best things heavily formula vehicle   elvis  opening production numbers  including nicely staged  adam and evil       deborah walley s  girl drummer  role     deusenberg     elvis  closing production number  medium walking blues  i ll be back   everything else redundant 
1,three lovely young ladies elvis  gearstick craptastic musical comedy s bad rocks  i love title song sequence les guys provide  elvis    lots lots girls   and chick  blonde short cropped hair literally shoves chikadees aside get spinout king  she looks like s prove really score  i never saw parts move like  elvis looks embarrassed  anyway  ve crossed double lines spinout  simply awful  i mean great way 
3,another cool elvis movie  cool car  time cobra  i prefer vettes    i like clambake better 
2,this film dubious honor included book  the worst films time   it definently  hardly call proper film  either  it rather loose framework new songs could presented less natural manner  a great great grandfather music videos  better 
2,spinout another hard movie  thanks weak dialogue even weaker storyline elvis plays singing race car driver  second time   chased three women  these include spoiled brat  shelley fabares   erotic author  diane mcbain   drummer  deborah walley  the music actually listenable picture  highlights include  stop  look  listen    i ll be back   elvis appears sleepwalking  his appearance disturbing  slightly overweight hair looks like big black ball head again  quite worst  far best  buy something worthwhile first 
5,back i i saw film numerous times  loved   still enjoy today  funny  great supporting cast  pretty girls  enjoyable soundtrack  hilarious racing finale  what s like  to reviewer   consider elvis  worst film  i ask  have seen harum scarum  now is bad

3,the round aluminum grill while large enough  does bend away from the heat  the distortion is enough to cool down  of the surface  is was advertised by the maker as non distorting  not quite true  not totally bad  though  as i am using it often  the handle gets very hot and one must take reasonable care in handling it  the truth is i am trying to turn a lectric glass top into a flat grille  takes practice   ca n t use iron on glass 
1,we buy new lunchbox  months  different brand  machine washable  way hard clean  i turned completely inside  scrubbed cracks  still food stuck seams andthreads  it durable  n t get rid smell stains reasonable amount effort 
3,as month old eats  outgrew small cold bag d used smaller bottles little bits food  we went looking lunchbox would hold   oz bottles well couple small food containers  well ice pack two  this lunchbox trick  loves animals the missing element  least  shoulder strap  smaller lunchbag short strap used sling bag around  especially came handy loading kid lunchbag diaperbag purse etc  onto airplane  i think improvise  n t terribly elegant 
3,if coming heels i consider best albums  el cielo  last  years  i may thought highly  catch   but  simply put   el cielo  decadent banana split  kinds favorite ice cream topped syrup  cherries  whipped cream nuts sprinkled top  lottsa stuff like   catch  plain ol vanilla  not banana split s still ice cream  i ve eat much worse  but i still next banana split  dredg  at least throw damn chocolate syrup top 
4,let say first el cielo desert island albums  the soaring melodies  heart melting vocals  passion   this album feels commercial  i still like lot  magic made fall el cielo n t really anymore  though i m glad band many fans  i say though feels bit focused el cielo band matured little bit  i guess i found first passionate  whereas professional 
3,floats enjoyably enough many blasts melodic rock pop less memorable bridge material sounds like last stab brilliant accessibility 
4,simply better bands around today  do favor pick music  i m sure ll find pleasant surprise 
3,having listened tracks  catch without arms  couple times  i struck lack songs instant appeal songs  el cielo   this surprising  considering average track length seems pared earlier dredg efforts  this  theory  make accessible songs that say  instant appeal  lithmus test dredg songs  it i floored listening dredg s previous release  el cielo  first time  the mix moodiness well crafted songs perfect standout tracks  catch without arms    bug eyes    sang real   coincidentally  tracks remind vibe dredg caught  el cielo   really  i n t know make cd yet  perhaps needs time ripen 
4,this album wonderful piece work  great production   especially drums  nice compressed snare  great songwriting   this goes without saying anyone familiar dredg  the lyrics spot on   every lyric fits perfect everything  go check earlier releases well  it s good  i hope dredg continue make good music otherwise terribly trendy unoriginal industry ps   teerav      while i agree album great  really check silverchair cd   diorama  making fun  it s really really good 
4,the main problem listening cd much vocals songs sound alike  the good thing sound pretty good  i listen every song part enjoy  distant future i see getting tired cd  hey  get tired song general listen enough times   i find lot bands fall trap making much good thing  what sets dredg apart get away opinion occasion 
2,if word evolving means simplify song structures lyrics make dull lame band really good  how say band evolving  yes album easy listen washing dishes hanging around friends drinking beer  even becomes boring  i feeling dredg biggest amount fanboys ever  what say totaly irrelevant  i never wanted new album like el cielo  and really doubt dissapointed reviewers wanted another el cielo  it soulless guys 
2,i completely agree   album seems unlike thoughfull talented band  not say ve lost faith dredg  need time get travesty 
1,i really n t understand reviewers going crazy record  first  i bought without hearing anything  highly recomended people like tool mars volta amazon   they coul n t wrong  so  personally find painfull  well  whole thing general quite painfull  first  musicians  the whole band sound like studio musicians  no obvious indivuality anything new offer  then get vocals  the closest thing i compare alison moyet anthony johnsons  i n t mind anthony johnsons  guys vocals music n t rock  which fine  it s ok rock  but hell  tool fan mars volta fan  i recomended  it s bland  s week  dubby bass  boring guitar playing sound   weak vocals  actually  forget  the whole package  it lame 
3,the redeeming quality game able play favorite ultra characters game feels like first release mortal kombat back s  the developers raised bar high challenge letting user figure start game win match  let s say bang head wall lot  even  easy  mode  s difficult defeat bad guy  mention s nearly impossible figure use combination attacks  since instructions  but s fun see ultras monsters moving around  get really like ultraman

2,as father daughter autism  surprised little time author contributed family life  more time spent work writing book sounds like home would place critical time family  he writes often n t critize ve walked shoes yet problems bashing gfcf diet proved helpful many families  written great love  sure priorities order

2,it s difficult understand  star reviews album gotten  the production excellent performances immaculate  music cheesy lacks soul  honestly  album screams  sell   sad watch great wilson sisters  though commercial success  i m glad good fortune  seattle  i soft spot great band   among least albums  only worth picking completists  everyone else stick heart s strong earlier catalog 
3,this release made big impact wilson sisters company  the four singles quite good even album tracks  nobody home  particular fairly ear catching  will heart memorable beatles  stones  eagles  fleetwood mac  i doubt  however  make noteworthy contributions world rock roll good portion album 
4,i m rock snob  i think ann wilson sexy  i always liked album  favorite song  nothin all   until i got cd  i listened cassette edition  i disappointed hear least two tracks   never  favorite  replaced different takes  in case  never   i n t really  since replacement sounds essentially original  but original track  nothin all  definitely preferable replacement  first  s clean  ann nancy add extra vocal stuff gets way  second  worse  ann sounds breath  one reasons i loved song much grateful confidence exuded  that diminished replacement track 
2,to beginning wilson sisters  sure  okay songs  i thought i recently replaced vinyl lp cd  these songs sound dated i n t believe i used like  to put mildly  album heart s contributions  hair band  movement  synthesizers drum machines taken nancy howard s guitar playing  dreamboat anne little queen still sound good today released  this cd 
5,could n t ask better transaction  shipped super fast item described 
5,this best heart album ever made opinion  i grew listening heart i still listen  i saw ann nancy concert last year awsome usual  my favorite song  these dreams   another good song  what about love   heart numerous  hits s amazing people still love listen 
4,at time originally released  i worked retail store department adjoining music section  they used play tracks time  after  i kind brainwashed  it got good  i bought tape the tape always annoyed    linear  could n t skip nasty tracks good ones easily  this cd release helps lot  on hand  i bought cd  i stopped listening tape years ago  it took long remember buy cd version my favorite tracks  these dreams     what about love     never   this cd pures rock anything i think  buy s re looking 
2,this material represents s died  music bland poppy  wilson sister s garnered wigs corsets music became something inside joke mentioning real bands  looking back cd music dated caught best left forgotten 
5,one favorite things s synth heavy pop rock heart  wow  i love album  chock full classic s lite rock sound  fantastic ann nancy wilson vocals  all around great stuff 
5,there really n t reason i rationalize  landmark s album mode recording  boston  s albums  it sounds huge  phil spectorish  wall sound   great melody combined grit tacked saccharine sweet hooks  this massive aural assault bunches decent  though big time aor  songs help  part  hold way past s prime  sure sounds dated  infectious  mood right  still works  unlike boston s  boston   undeniably best   certainly n t best thing wilson sisters ever done  however stands s unique sonic place time remains highly listenable  a guilty pleasure 
5,if word could describe  s  would heart  cd brings back memories i growing i would hear songs like  these dreams  radio  today i song i co n t get enough  i never forget song  if love s music i highly reccomend get cd
3,being huge heart fan since release  dreamboat annie   i sure make self titled album  while i thrilled  heart  album huge success  i wondered happend favorite band  they longer folky  blusey  rockin band i grew   huge hit machine lots pop rock hits huge hair  this album  however  expertly executed  it accomplished goal spades   turn heart pop rock hit making machine  all songs good ann nancy band top form  again proving could play anything  however  soul gone

2,i really did n t care for this book at all  i found both the writing and the story lacking and unimaginative  i bought this book with an interest in fantasy that revolves around elves or fey  i was sorely disappointed by this book  there was very little about the main character s fey heritage  the story itself is choppy and the characterization weak  a waste of both money and time  i will not be reading any more of this authors books

3,i really liked pillow first  it comfortable right size  after month  however  pillow lost lot personality become pretty flat  most pillows crush time  i n t really say i m disappointed  however  price  i hoping constructed sturdy material 
4,i bought lot money relax the back store  amazon much better price  i like design flaws  the pillow case hard get onto pillow stretches taught right i d like rest head making bit uncomfortable  also lower  legs  product much firm knees  it raises leg high hurts hip  i m     n t problem petite  a flat spot formed within days i lift open get bed  i still like n t found anything comparable

3,good concept  offers support comfort   months pregnant bought pillow since m supposed sleep side  however u shape wider looks photos  n t keep side   filling uneven  firmer parts others 
2,this pillow incredibly helpful people difficulty getting comfortable bed affords variety positions relieve painful areas  but getting bed require simple gymnastic maneuvers pillow thick cumbersome  and getting bed requires special moves  especially high mattress  overall  simple process good nights sleep  the head area compresses nights use rearranging filling bothersome  because s considerable investment  i using occasionally

4,this product much better apple oem charger terms durability  it blue light adapter lets know s plugged  indication computer charged like oem  that said i pleased could almost buy two units price apple wants flawed version 
5,the adaptor works really well ibook powerbook  it really long extension cord  the problem slightly bulky apple  so  traveling around  unless big computer case  fit nicely  other  great  much cheaper new apple adapter works nicely  it sturdier apple adaptor annoying light

5,who needs mac accessories equally good  better  product like macally powerbook ibook ac adapter  i purchased item daughter mac made original ac adapter connection frayed fixable  we tried get replacement mac retail stores mac on line  everyone know would available  this made think original cords must somewhat defective since demand  we turned amazon order macally ac adapter trepidation price lower mac made product  that several months ago macally adapter worked perfectly pleased purchase  i would recommend product anyone needs new adapter lower price  would advise instead mac 
4,good product  a lot cheaper apple version exact thing  seems little durable well 
3,i ve replacement adapter nearly month much hesitation beginning  like many reviews stated  power connection indicator top ibook g would alternate power supply battery supply  causing annoying flicker screen  that since stopped adapter plugged  charges normal  i e  allowing utilize computer charges  when initial flicker screen started beginning  ibook would charge i put sleep mode closed screen  i m sure i ve done differently since problem stopped i m sure give advice far recommending product  simply  buyer beware   
4,i ve two apple adapters terrible  this adapter works well g ibook  the laptop connecter sturdier components appear adequate  a small blue led transformer indicates adapter functional  i m pleased product costs less half price apple s sexy hopelessly flawed accessory 
4,this good replacement apple charger  only couple notes make  the blue light n t indicate whether notebook charging  cord plugged outlet  this means n t really tell going unless open laptop make sure indicator showing charging   if drain battery fully  laptop goes sleep be warned   you able plug resume working right away  i plug let charge good i could operate powerbook  pulling power operate computer charge battery  this annoying other weird gripes  sufficient power adapter 
3,this unitw  the original apple part  a1021 w  the result full charge ibookhrs rather    check wattage original adapter  watts  dc volts  dc amps  otherwise quality good 
1,this product work ibook g  as stated earlier reviews customers  charger toggles charging charging  occasionally  left  continuously charge  i thought keeping  unreliable third party options  more this going back amazon

2,i read reviews product i bought mentioned makes high pitched sound  i figured reviewers probably defective adapters  however  makes high pitched sound  it n t time  i worry gets older  sound get worse  although charges computer fine  i could  i might pay extra money get different brand   unless n t mind high pitched noises 
4,i buyrd  each lasted   months  apple charger lasts  amount use i put  so money  i like buy every  months   rather drop  apple brand 
1,nice form factor etc   bad function  product appears charge powerbook g   asleep  working cycles emits faint buzzing sound brick  try another product

4,i got tired packing unpacking charger powerbook everyday  home work  this adapter great option  it works fine much better buy 
4,the downside adapter vs apple s lack light ring tells whether computer fully charged  otherwise s great deal 
3,for reason powerbook completely runs  attaching power cord allow immediately turn back computer  unlike apple cord  do know     minute lag time plugging  playing  real pain  other  cord seems work fine

4,much inexpensive apple adapter  takes little longer get  significantly longer  easier plug anywhere vs apple adapter  significant differences design nothing adapter indicate charging charging complete otherwise great buy 
4,i love macs years  i get really irritated replace low grade peripherals time  especially power supplies  the macally version great  smaller  lighter longer apple version  half cost  works fine  i ve used macally stuff s always solid well thought  definitely fills void 
2,an ac dc power converter basic item  i little doubt expensive apple original would effective  though stylish  unfortunately  problems  the powerbook started delivering electrical shocks inconsistent charging adapter  got worse moved countryv  i know shock problem comes macally adapter i another pb original apple power supply  combinatorial tests  i like macally several products  i probably got bum unit unfortunately deliver positive review based previous experience company 
2,the adapter worked fine power book g months broke  nothing physically happened adapter break  suddenly would n t charge  what s interesting blue light brick goes plugged power source  i plug cable attaches computer brick  light goes n t charge 
1,we ordered macally ps ac power adapter received entirely different product differnt comany  as noted amazon shoppers received th inspire m848  this adapter differnet following ways instead cord velcro wrapper  short cord leavesthe transformer hanging input computer  this ultimately break dc connection board this repairable  their led power light advertised leaving wondering  it clearly cheap knck taken idiots might recognize  i mad  i went similar thing overstock  months emails  calls waiting hold   grain satisfaction  it insulting think big companies little respect us 
3,i would n t suggest charger unless selling laptop someone need prove computer works  the quality construction  notably cord connect computer attaches power brick  awful  spend little get something better

3,this book good read last chapters  the story line begins unravel bit toward  there pieces left unfinished ending poor i thought copy must missing last chapter  most binchy s novels beautifully polished  unfortunately  leaves silver somewhat tarnished

4,started bit slow i hooked  finished yet cant wait next oppertunity carry
4,i agree reviewers best novel  i would rathered write half characters go depth  i would get story would  person would n t heard anniversary celebration  i like part various invites party answered   not direct quote    they would send flowers card  would attend  way  it quick read  though  great rainy weekend trip beach  also try tara road  good novel well 
3,i enjoyed first two thirds book much novel frontier i ever read  unfortunately  i disappointed part   the whole tone third segment jarringly anachronistic peppered little in jokes  example  delaware indian named lenny lenapier  the actual delaware tribe leni lenape  i felt like i suddenly reading comic books people plunged s  it seemed like jones wrote first two parts serious frontier story  said  to hell   turned last portion farce  what letdown  excellent beginning middle  mention author s superb the buffalo runners  authentic historical tone maintained throughout 
4,ching  years book veryinformative gives ways divining thewilhelm baynes classic  highly recommend 
3,the novel engrossing caught held attention  but book lacked good heroine since esther n t actually anything amazing  she little adventurous appealing invaders 
5,absolutely amazing  s way describe dvd a must queensryche fans 
3,well i thought would good addition concert dvd collection listen home bar  while i love queensryche  i never seen concert therefore aware stage show like going play  i gone lot concerts seen acting stage  i guess hards like husband expected distracting  it hard enjoy beautiful  creative songs watching bad acting  and might i add i felt though all songs lipsynched vocals exact sounded exactly recorded versions  bottom line  i would ve rather played cd s ipod watch heavy metal soap opera 
4,to really get complete mindcrime experience  i would recommend getting operation  livecrime dvd well  if find booklet  even better  watch first part livecrime dvdnd part dvd  the original mindcrime original lineup topped  for part  great job considering n t budget live shows early s  mindcrime  level first part  who expects 
1,this performance pure garbage  unfortunately i pathetic show  the audience mostly old geezers watch group geriatric has beens  the sound awful  performance west side story ridiculous  hatred america sad  halfway show  singer serious trouble hauling fat ss around stage  he sounded like exhausted pig  gorging trough  it bad enough would embarrass performing front people  actually recorded disaster  now think sell crap  
3,well  lets start general impressions  overall good dvd  the sound great video great  the band pulls mindcrime discs well live  it s true geoff tates voice better days  sounds lot better live evolution  however  acting leaves much desired  i n t know decided sport madonna microphone act parts show  he kind reminded meat loaf the rocky horror picture show  but like i said  overall great disc queensryche fans  i highly recommend

2,  full misleading album  run mill fan electronic metamusic could desire  this album seven tracks  ranging time  minutes  n t let fool thinking s much variety  all meld together first   fish   highlight among others moderately well crafted distinct  there definite feeling sonic recycling   n t i hear whir previous track    limited sound spectrum within grasp  one n t expect terribly much indie techno  unfair condemn album lack equipment  it s usually competent  even musical  occasional vocal bit differentiates track another  tends seek greener electropastures 
5,this great music  funk eyes great eddie palmieri  a total fusion time period  a mix funky  jazzy latin rock a little like band  war   
1,i bought book amazon used condition like new   little i realize even think n t jacks ball  now i try find right size jacks  jumbo ones  ball  i guess get pay 
4,excelente dc  aunque grabación vivo auditorio admirador cacho veces entorpece sonido 
2,the stiffs were a good soft band this cd is supposed to be a collection of their best work  but missing is here are the songs d c rip  and another great track from that     for captain oi  to leave out such awesome work is disturbing  i was very disappointed with this release  it should have been titled  the stiffs_love songs collection   the band itself rates better than  stars  but not having the songs it should of had  greatly depreciates this cd 
1,i used product first time returning it the cheap cologne smell inescapable  wash stuff ll smelling day i popped top smelled store  using smell much stronger

1,the hard cover reprint edition offered amazon others incomplete  it contains part  note page count   compare trade paperback versions  page count  avoid edition 
2,audio technically flawed  the instumental sounds not crisp clear  the musical selections ellington orchestration excellent  but unclear audio makes listening album like viewing blurred  focus photograph  definitely not worthwhile selection serious duke ellington afficionados 
5,we always need extra little pieces could n t find anywhere  great find good quality price

4,i could n t resist  i cd  kenny s voice easy listening standards worth listening  so i tried  i ever taken aback  his rough  yet soothing voice unwrapped new sound classics  it s hard compare  proven songs  kenny s effort deserves recognition 
2,nice pictures  descriptions map book n t even mention merritt islandbuy proper birdbook rather overpriced pamphlet
3,it worth price  the wood nice enough  the dimensions inaccurate  however  actually  inches deep   featured  i purchased drawer inches deep  i able use another drawer  ends well  the construction method involved use staples promptly popped little stress  i hammered couple fine finishing nails replace works fine 
3,the loc a ball feature possibility working  there  inch clearance boxes  the balls probably stick  i screwed boxes together works designed  i worried i would split wood i stayed away ends drilled countersunk holes screws  i used screw side box slide relative self  i would liked used two screws side i decided chance spliting wood  i since seen similar box big box store would better value 
3,think book understood  first foremost  women s studies title much product written  times author actually recounting sss  keep context  think lot criticized understandable  s dated  could deeper   yes  author bit self focused  s worst account  either  worth borrowing library 
3,the insider outsider view amish life interesting  i thought  fair  aspects finds admirable would like bring life aspects  though interesting  would like adopt  in instances  i would wholeheartedly agree sue bender s point view  appreciate time effort took become acquainted amish families message offers  i knew sue richard bender i student berkeley  visited home times found admirable  artists people  i inspired way lived lives  but i agree numerous reviewers annoying narcissism telling  perhaps inward looking story changed artist another book fully declared jacket 
1,it absolutely unbelievable woman is therapist  reading book  needs  she relates clay children people  whatever looking amish community  never found translates reader  do n t waste time poor read 
2,i wanted read book simple life amish people intrigued me i wish lady would talked amish instead  read  me       what i life   why i this that   blah blah blah by book reader really n t anymore  it scarey find woman therapist yikes  the reason i gave  stars   when talk amish interesting    it short book quick read 
1,this book self centered piece random musings  it amish  it author  frankly  s someone i would really meet discuss important issues  she spends so much time her thoughts  her ideas  forgets supposed book amish way life  this journey to amish  it boring  breathtakingly conceited journey author s confused mind  i suggest counseling  her book plain stinks 
2,i thought book sad commentary lostness author  though sought understand amish way life  totally missed  maybe church service german maybe focused could see beyond fact peace comes relationship god  her final line book stated miracles lot work  i would beg disagree say god miracles therefore work  faith  this sue bender missed still missing i afraid  we use amish textbooks home education program  insights shared really new  i think description amish valid  understanding lacking  i would particularly recommend book 
3,i enjoyed author s plain simple narrative pictures book  her story well told using unadorned pictures unembellished prose  it set nice tone entire experience struggles letting accepting  the disturbing part book left family  inner voice   what listening voice reason 
2, stars pretty generous  opinion  this book seemed like book process went writing book visiting amish families  i found wondering i might able find book spent much time  pouring soul   the book largely spent talking incredible completed daunting task filled many backhanded remarks regarding amish communities  she comes pompous self indulgent  like humbled  pious woman paints  would recommend skipping book 
2,this disapointing book  the author makes complexe amish community forgave muders young daughters nickle mine school diminsional disney characters  there tension  conflict human conditions make people real  oh sweet group simple people of course allow us learn anything amish i sure lot learn them the author self absorbed tries draw lessons time amish  there spots i though  o please get   i n t finish book  waste time 
4,this nice book read  it pleasantly vivid  especially talking amish food habits  heaps ice cream kinds fattening food   i enjoyed descriptions  author s disturbing overwhelming need express reasserts book s  move sublime simplicity back mainstream american s need selfish self expression every nitwit feeling emotion intuition i felt bit nauseous  the book clear snapshot symptom self obsession perhaps obvious san francisco  book best seller 
1,you sure must missed lot journey the amish backwards group misfits i ever encountered where kids beat  were wives talked belitted  were animals beat starved  i thought  maybe another trip   tell like really  i think much book  it not true
5,i felt extremely well written moving little book  i recommended many friends  in fact  i bought copies sent  it made stop think life complicate prioritize 
4,this story woman became interested amish decided try live awhile  it interesting read outsider would go getting secretive world  her experiences representative amish  says book  many variations belief practice among amish across country  i surprised hear amish using telephone  motorized pumps  polyester clothing  running shoes  plastic  using store bought white bread cereal laced supplements the author experience become amish returns normal life  appreciation simplicity modern world  for find resonance concept  i recommend reading barry schwartz s the paradox of choice  when more is less  expanded development idea 
2,the book presents historical political account middle east  the book originally written  revised  during process revision  khouri  appearantly  make many changes original text  fact leaves much book outdated  khouri s account takes strong anti israeli pro arab stance  for example  chooses downplay palestinian terrorist attackss mentions attacks attack israeli athletes munich attack marine base beirut detail  his study based closely un records ignores reality middle east

1,hard squeeze  hard fill  hard get pinch spice  miniature hole get salt peppercorns units  spill everywhere n t hold much re always filling  the handles small hard hold  you squeeze least times get decent amount spice 
1,the description says adjust coarseness salt pepper  knob mini grinders  we replaced store bought salt salt grinder n t work  disappointing 
2,perhaps larger model works well  this smaller magnetic set tragic  the upside re working grip strength  probably help  to get useable amount pepper  ll squeeze times  they feel cheap destined quick trip trash  stick tried true twist grinder 
1,i purchased pepper grinder kitchen outlet store  one  rabbit ear  handles snapped base less month use  i n t reccomend product 
2,looks like cute little bunnies fridge  re eye candy  shakers n t store lot salt pepper  handles small comfortably hold  s hard detect salt pepper coming

3,there good short stories explore interesting concepts  others poor need work  all fiction good worth getting editing atrocious  this book riddled countless mistakes misprints picked half competent editor  none get way stories always clear author meant  so book still worth buying unless little things like  petal  instead  pedal  annoy  in case steer well clear book 
2,i quite disappointed collection  after first three stories  i basically gave  interesting concepts could benefited great deal really good editor  this stuff really belongsth grade creative writing class

4,in book  napoleon   felix markham traces rise fall important western history  as biography  markham sometimes relies much questionable references  history  napoleon  ranks among great works subject  the reports battles served emperor first rate  one almost imagine marengo  austerlitz waterloo  riding alside ney  marmont  junot  perhaps appealing aspects book accounts napoleon s life exile st helena events surrounding death  markham shows us napoleonic legend helped shape post imperial france  i would recomend book anyone would like know facinating historical figure 
2,this may good book military history  i military historian  i attest sound markham s research subject  just know buying  there almost nothing napoleon person  compared biographies  and social context gave rise napoleon really explored  i find first two chapters book deal napoleon s genealogy early years interesting well written  after book got dense writing style rather pedestrian  everything beyond first chapter book written specialist  scholar focusesth century military history   at time publication book received glowing reviews i help wonder i missed 
2,napoleon probably widely written historical figures  there many differing views intentions ambitions  markham takes somewhat unclear  point view writting french emperor  at times seems like praising napoleon thing times criticizing  corsican orge   he laudes napoleon s form government advanced beyond years yet draws unreliable memoirs denounced napoleon impunity  unreliable  memoirs written   wished regain bourbon favour allowed back prestigious positions  i feel markham n t give lucid explaination intervention spain matter russia  towards picture drawn book becomes nebulous  given choice two uncompromising pictures napoleon

5,coming someone whose musical preferences run gamut  mariah carey portishead cardigans back geri haliwell  words hold quite bit meaning  i read reviews album touted  best career   course  skeptical  i say complete honesty bluegrass something i unfamiliar  something i greatly appreciate  the music fresh live  different mainstream pop hear nowadays  well deserving listen anyone ear music  whether city boy  bronx  ny   good music way transcending boundaries  discs 
4,dolly described cd  blue mountain  cd  part bluegrass  part mountain music  this good gets  dolly never fails deliver dolly fan fan good music general  disappointed 
5,dolly parton has shown with this amazing all bluegrass album  the grass is blue  why she can still carry the title of queen of country music  dolly is not getting the radio airplay that she still deserves  so she left country music and released an all bluegrass album that is in no way disappointing  i strongly feel dolly will win a grammy for this work of pure mountain music art  also a warm welcome to the recent hall of fame member 
4,i m casual bluegrass fan i really enjoy album  dolly s voice perfectly suited style music musicians uses obviously best business the complaint i  minutes  album short  dolly sings every cut i n t think would hurt give stellar band instrumental number two  if album two three extra tracks  instrumental otherwise  i would given five stars   this album short  could considered compliment case s partially  although i would liked gotten little quantity money  quality music could better 
1,i hate disagree many people love cd  i find little like  i found ballads weepy  upbeat songs cliched  singing musicianship professional uninspiring  to give idea tastes  favorites nashville bluegrass band  american beauty   steve earl del mccrory band  the mountain   ricky skaggs kentucky thunder  bluegrass rules   in opinion   the grass blue  approach artistic standards many current cd s  once  offense intended many people fond cd  the bottom line  i plan making day somebody wants cd selling copy used cd store

4,since many music genres  among  latin american  traditions lhasa draws inspiration  use limited aural palette philosophy starting point individual compositions  i think unfair criticize lhasa lyrical aural restrictions  i would rather hear band express well using limited repetoire barely adequately play dozen styles  that s called  eclectic approach    s far hyped lately 
5,lhasa s music  her music crosses language race boundaries  as person bond strongly female singers   kate bush  billie holiday  cesaria evora   lhasa s music speaks close female friend  sister mother amazing  intriguing voice  simple yet dramatic  dramatic yet uncontrived her velvet resonance beauty songs slip unnotice past defenses touch private self i heard seconds song  pared  face wall   show  due south   enough make determine track singer song  i managed net  and amazement  i found  la llorona  singapore s hmv

4,the reason i giving cd  stars instead   short  lhasa s voice sultry  sad powerful  the music haunting yet airy  perfection 
2,reading numerous exalting critiques new cd lhasa  i finally gave bought   i admit  exoticism  haunting  style interpretation captivating ones familiar mexican latin american musical traditions  however  various musical styles appropriated cd merit greater diversity interpretation 
2,after reviews  difficult feel like i would injustice   yet  i think claim like lhasa would much prefer originality talent chavela vargas  indeed  lhasa s raspy voice deeply influenced cigarrette smoking vargas  what called haunting voice  passion  reviewers  mode interpretation lhasa administers indiscriminately every song repertoire  especially cd includes merry chrismas songs 
2,utterly amazing unique sound  her voice powerful 
1,one truly great song  first disc  followed weird takes mexican folk music depressing moans  the brilliant arrangement accompaniment first song  mi cara pared   sexy  mournfully loping tango  led expect greatness within  alas  lhasa one trick pony  potentially great voice  reduced strained yodelling subsequent uninteresting numbers  it s almost undecided category wanted present  world music  latin  pop  rock  unfortunately seems none  if i mexican folk songs  i ll call linda ronstadt  the arranger producer  forgotten  waited present cd tricks sleeve singer better songs  a great disappointment  first number killer

1,oh  horrible  i m lara junkie  i m completely embarassed horrid game  the pc controls joke  seem spin circles re trying make simple turn  i feel completely ripped folks eidos releasing bug filled game  game locks worst possible moments  cut screnes long dull  let us play game without need watch movie every level   put energy fixing movement controls lock issues  please  n t waste hard earned cash    maybe eidos get message 
2,this  far  bug filled game i ever played  the new control system extremely clumsy leave lara die hards wondering developers thinking decided revamp old  i hate say  i think eidos concerned missing another promised release date sent unfinished product  obvious quality issues apparent first chapter get progressively worse  i would surprised company issue recall defective product  on positve note  improved graphics beautiful  hard appreciate frustrating gameplay

1,i bought game reduced price still feel like i got ripped  the controls pc version absolute nightmare make could otherwise decent game horrible  sometimes feel like control whatsoever  good thing two successful movies made game otherwise eidos would ve business horrendous offering  in fact i ll think twice purchasing anything eidos core design attached 
1,i assume game going  stink  why would s release pushed back third time  i tired waiting  this game must bad eidos core must feel needs severe refinement release on top release date changes  neither eidos core bothered put news thier sites

4,the graphics game really really good a big downer controls  used really easy you ve got choice use anolog buttons hate  the locations detailed interaction friends enemies impressive but  i m sure good idea bring another character overall  good game worth money  v good graphics locations  the set backs game controls  extra character 
1,this game angel darkness  the control system impossible  the menu screens ridiculous bulky manage  i played tomb raider games  this near unplayable  this thing went straight ebay  save money something good  the tr people need something fresh character like send space something  jeez  franchise getting old stale due lack innovation change 
2,hmmmm  veteran tomb raider someone playsst person shooters appear i quite disappointed game controls  the story great  graphics much better previous tomb raider releases controls ruined game  one would thinkst person shooters precise smooth controls tomb raider would   it frustrating try play well done story continually lack ability accurately control lara s movement  i hope edios learns experience

2,watch turkey  definitely disk true believers  sound quality bad bootleg i ever listened  songs fade  live album    skimpy liner notes add pretty bad package  and addition keyboard player seems hurt rather add wa s sound  if dying live disk wa s  locked in  tour   otherwise  save money

2,this wonderful victorian style novel manor house  mistress  domestics  wonderful  middle story  the author makes choices effectively shut flow pacing story  it s spooky interesting  sudden turn unexpected switch narrator s point view  time  setting make rest great read downer 
2,to call collection victorian erotica inaccurate implies stories  i felt rather cheated realise obviously twentieth century additions  it might accurate titled collectionthth century erotica
3,this book essentially directory victorian erotica  recapping highlights major effort  many   should reader expecting something else  almost certainly disappointed 
2,it would nice editor included bibliography  people could read entire novel  for example  the  romance lust  selection n t author justice  the original big book  wherein author could n t possibly held job anywhere since devoted entire day erotic diversions  no safe  even aunt sisters  well  maybe family  other selections uninteresting  is editor really major  why need military rank book  is still active duty

1,i often struggle trying empty clippings lawnmower garbage bag i hoped product would make task easier  i disappointed  i must say  the frame thin unstable  the assembly instructions hard understand product hard assemble set hands  i pleased product  it seems though would collapse i use intended purpose  i recommend product

4,this science fiction novel walks around speculative situation natural  social even political choice  population distribution  agreement skills gifts naturally many facts occur interesting  remarkable issue make us think elusive dreams better even pacific society 
3,first  like utopian vision  book lacks life  though i think psychedelics  entheogens  help people get touch larger reality  i dont think holds true everyone  for instance  personal transformation inner conflicts treated simplistically  i think dynamic peaceloving people pala internal greedy members well outsiders wished exploit island rang true  would like give book better review  i can t thomas seay

5,one time favorite books  glad new copy
3,i think book adventerous scary  it n t best book i ve ever read pretty good though  my favorite part fell ship  the bad part could n t fine 
2,i decided read  island  enjoyed  brave new world  much  well former really horrible compared latter  it s pretty boring  plot n t make much sense main character s ideas often place while certain parts story interesting  s entirety  would give two thumbs  
1,please let begin agreeing reviewers aldous huxley brilliant  forward thinking modern history  whole  wonderfully gifted writer  that said  book absolutely  unequivocably horrible  it pages plotless  repetitive socio preach  mr huxley s  a brave new world   opinion  best novels ever written   island  rise level  though  i would wish upon anyone 
2,it decent book  lot new information  for part  simply confirmed basics i long believed  living dreams children  encouraging exploration without forcing achievement  need provide additional means learning  etc  a lot time spent selecting schools gifted kids  really n t apply small towns like live  some good chapters different kinds gifted children scattered teaching methods  a lot  real life  examples stretched across several chapters opinion became scattered approach probably novel idea came across s better  good enough  parent perfect  by klein s opinion  manage perfect parent  set standard high child anxieties trying live example  not sure i m   interesting parenting 
1,this software user friendly  the samples n t help  i would imagine i sat hundred hours i could figure dots go  the whole interface n t make sense  it s time consuming  total waste dollars apple store

2,easy reading book i would recommend sort  executive summary  story behind wright works  having said  i found depth detail lacking read extensively architect whose noteriety growing time  not collectors unless  like  book help fill spectrum vast number publications continue popular view 
4,our sunday school class middle aged adults ordered book class study  we lot fun learning lot time  great study

3,now  complete thrill back i first started buying bill haley cds october  i heard  rock joint   i thought cd extremely skimpy  it n t classic  rocket    it n t great tunes like  green tree boogie    sundown boogie   this   does n t even booklet  really  sure  old recordings beginning career  i would rather go  rock joint     this cd includes classics like  rock joint     rocking chair on moon     fractured     crazy man  crazy    real rock drive   though 
3,these bill s recordings earlys became immensely popular  shake rattle and roll    rock around the clock   sadly n t find great early stuff cd  good starter price really low 
1,there two mistakes dvd  the english title italian movie either bread  love dreams  original  pane  amore fantasia  bread  love jealousy  original  pane  amore gelosia   the actors vittorio sica  gina lollobrigida marisa merlini played movies product description could easily related  both movies directed luigi comencini vittorio sica  boudu saved from drowning famous jean renoir movie  both italian movies good  star mistakes 
2,the playing merely competent  singing sounds like jump rope chanting much time  but flashes inspiration  it s unlikely songs stay cd  feel much draw put

4,when i first read three  plantation  books gwen bristow years ago  i enthralled i read twice   well years later i read three past week  great books stand test time  each book read alone i recommend series  loved years ago still love  
2,the book contains pages text  pages refenreces   pages index  many figures cartoon explain concept author s hypothesis  barbieri development biologist mrc cambridge  nih  max planck this typical anti darwinism semi pseudoscience book  i picked book book cover chomsky s accolade  it s obvious outrageous intelligent desing sort book  author cites book explain main points  many biological facts book real correct  scientific logical structure support author s  semantic  theory  i struck fact book published cambridge university press 
2,hello   this i think listening new album germanys  thrash metal godfathers nothing new still rock like hell  unfortunately made step backwards like slayer mayhem step forward  well  i believe old school fanatics enjoy feature  sodoms great days gone  their last good record  tapping vein   i great fan years repeat  i happy giving cruel review record i say  sorry guys  better luck next time  ok 
5,like code red album sodom this album scarey makes feel cool
4,i experience rts games  total annihilation  age empires empire earth  i bought praetorians played first time  i found interesting it s typical rts game produce lot units simply attack enemy  like example ta kingdoms others  think strategic way moving attacking enemy  in game  mission mission  learn balance troops move territory  it s important fact troops interact territory  hills  woods   you hide troops  stay higher enemy attack enemy suddenly  example  bowmen higher position hurt seriously enemy   in missions lay siege fortess machines to sum  i think s good game  enjoy live experience  de bello gallico   
2,i bought game friend said excellent  however s never good gamer  i thought resource management idea ok  ruins half point rts  strategy careful management resources fund army   dont resources  dont army    i d say ok someone n t really know play real rts  expert  i d save warcraft   the frozen throne  n t got normal warcraft   go buy 
1,everyone knows good strategy game involves somewhat steep learning curve advanced difficulty level  this game simply click attack real time strategy involve heavy thinking  in fewer words s bunnie slope youngsters discovering thrill games  in conclusion i feel word strategy innapropriate altogether  true strategy players return product  rookies like ll feel moderately challenged 
2,    let warn potential customers book quantity material instead quality  while book cover advanced topics fourier analysis intro partial differential equations  book lacks sufficient examples said  number sections examples  i find well written sections application second order differential equations  applied spring oscillations etc   however  far getting bang buck  i highly recommend morris tennenbaum harry polland s ordinary differential equations dover edition  cheaper  much more effective  trust  
2,i m student taking class using book  i ve found difficult follow short explanations  without additional resources  i would able learn material book 
2,while shipping amazing  book much use list problems  the text explaining theory behind written like sandpaper often jumps around leaving important processes  it would hard book use solo resource w o instructor leading 
2,i decided self study ap environmental science  i eventually received   this textbook i considering use  i found difficult read  mention bit politically oriented   i would recommend raven berg apes  concise comprehensive test 
2,voice  breathy  suit taste  i would n t say bad  kind music i like 
4,run place red  first cut  great  if like recent direction taken people like tim hecker amon tobin  consider richard d james twist cut up trend  trademark super hyper drum track  and  like rdj s past stuff  suitably nightmarish queasy the second two tracks causing bit controversy  consisting mainly noise analog style knob tweaking sounds  high pitched shrieks  distorted screams  etc  there beat  melody  little apparent structure  although marginally structured  metal machine music     this uncompromising music rdj done  s quite statement  maybe remix subotnick s  silver apples moon   anyway  s faint heart  it n t kick   n t make booty move  might stay away unless re real noise head 
4,people look piss take ep  rdj s personal wealth whatnot  and  truthfully  is but n t make  real  track worth money it indeed  grow  or else love right away  it s quite departure normal works  rarely somewhat understand lyrics  any the rest collection annoying noises either make neighbours go crazy  nothing really  musical  comes them so albeit rubbish ep  yet first track well worth price  re ways torturing people different pitches noise  re set 
4,i think afx s  run place red  incredibly fun  makes jump shimmy time i hear  now  i m huge fan ragga  ragga jungle drill n  bass  i think s genius combination  demented mind mr james could discover  you barely understand vocals beneath percussion   re flavor anything else  as two noise tracks  re rather interesting first time around  mention intense squeals   i n t think stand repeated listens  mostly i n t go deaf 
4,a little research internet would show rdj put squealing noise tracks like  the first track great  however  negative reviews second third tracks might premature  on least afx cd i   remixes    third track similar witha high pitch ticking  i recently found third track ep actually graphic   it s data  audio  sstv image  likewise  maybe tracks    smojphace cd n t music  data  i longer cd try decode 
2,like everything aphex twin ever made  exception  elephant song    album piece poo covered crust  thats right  crust     think mr smiley releasing stupidest stuff s ever made sort artsy fartsy nut chunk songs stink flamboyantly  first song features reggae  artist  much self esteem  gon get excited something dont make reggae lyrics   anyway hate lyrics  m little biased  parts song consist drums   insignificant effects  songs consist latter  music stuff  know arguably music  jeez  minutes next song exact stuff   ve gone soiled hope smiley mcgee happy 
2,two years  get  the first song decent  it rap reggae guy vocal thang  rdj s music behind background  except first seconds  music exceptional  nice crazy d n b stuff vocals  this song worth getting      the two tracks   noise  it s hooked electrodes recording equipment twiddled knobs something  or maybe real songs encrypted  who knows  they music  they re likely sick joke rdj 
3,only true aphex heads apreciate album  the first track offers killer drum n bass journey  hyper  withrdj s insane trademark  run mill dn b anything  the rhythm fades static  it still pounds head pulse second track begins seems distorted rhythm keeping first  goes ballistic  think tracks   inevitable comedown first track  eat chocolate covered espresso beans first understand 
2,yeah yeah yeah good    dollars three songs   n t like oxymoron 
4,if n t anything muffs  get first self titled cd  blonder blonder  first  then back one this collection alternative versions  demos  covers compilations  tunes n t make cut it s still best thing band released since  blonder blonder   if fan  liner notes worth ten bucks and get tunes   it s hard find kind bargain days do n t make first muffs album  make third 
1,i hoping band would evolved degree past decade  sadly  having courtney love message cd testament band tapped  now kims  d think would emphasis release breakthrough cd rather out takes past 
1,bought cd thinking would similar cover tune  kids america was i wrong  worst cd i ve displeasure listen to old chic  lead singer nothing scream throughout tracks  the tunes simplistic  lack depth show inkling creativity if like endless screaming nonsensical lyrics rubbish 
5,i m arts crafts director girlscout camp  i read lot craft books  klutz really best ones around  these rings easy  book gives everything need  scissors  several cute patterns  i m sure campers love projects  the complaints i included supplies  bead wheel cumbersome use  colors mix easily  also  n t much variety beads  easily supplement whatever hand 
3,didnt receive banner week laterdidnt receive confirmation online  it said shipped sitting doorstep   otherwise great product catches lot attention   i honestly say definately worth fill big wall space add little bit spice tailgate party weather resistant outside metal gromets hang easily anywhere

2,i n t find book interesting  though occasional humor  general  n t enjoy piece literature 
3,locked emotional abuse children clarence day s writing style adequate  book reads quickly  i finished two brief sittings   day would honor horror father writing memoir beyond me read play instead  lindsay crouse  l  c good sense soften father s character make palatable  in play find humor  memoir

3,i told writer friend  i expecting lot book  i found disturbing  aunt delia sick character i n t feel  coming age  story  twisted  the writing travis  point view  still seemed bit simplistic  i n t read novels author  i hope usual subject matter  i would n t recommend book friends  i finished book feeling i i saw movie  deliverance   
4,sweet dream baby n t grand fiction  s engrossing story vivid sense time place  the author pulled difficult trick showing world child s eyes yet supplying reader adult perceptions  parts plot predictable  conclusion predictibility flies window  the novel may sets  leave it to beaver ending anyone firsthand experience fifties may stretch suspension disbelief regarding certain sexual behaviors protagonist s aunt relation nephew  author traded bit unlikeliness gimmick elevates novel usual coming age story 
5,this book wake people opportunity manage control mortgage instead bank controling  good information  outlined well easiy understand examples as extra bonus great meet author harj gill night presented information showed apply knowledge business too look book make difference banking u s 
1,mathematically speaking  book nonsense  for instance  author argues owning home expensive owning  this true compare person living tree versus owning home  he argues person owning home negative cash flowk year due interest pays mortage  but details left  make useless point   person owns home home live hundred bucks month  whereas person n t home pay mayk year rent  that wipes savings author claiming  not  money drain since goes landlord  whereas owner home builds equity my recommendation stay away nonsensical book  else screwed follow advice 
2,this entire book could summed pages  it terribly repetitive  the basic premise use heloc instead checking account money n t around idle mortgage interest accruing  this may merit  clear much savings due putting disposable income towards mortgage  the big trade loss liquidity  i aware strategy  i hoped book would help prove effectivness  explain exactly  it falls short  after reading numerous message boards subject  book tought nothing new  it really feels like informercial i paid 
5,when understand banks interested making money  lots    ll understand book written  it helps keep money still paying borrowed  faster for conventional mortage  payments first years go primarily paying interest loan  little going principal  with people moving new  trading  every   years  wind paying lots interest little show  the banks get very rich way with book  learn move pool quicksand stand solid financial ground  harj writes clearly simply without talking  he lays beginning  everywhere between more worth investment life  definitely read

3,it held interest entertaining moments  paige s family interesting  her brother rachel kind got shorted plot development area  their story seemed paralleling ross paige suddenly disappeared  bad the main plot point quarantine bit unbelievable  it different twist throwing two mismatched people together long period time  lot holes  i liked ross  although times seemed bit perfect  paige needed someone grab shoulders  shake hard  tell get 
1,i got book free kindle  i read lot free kindle books great  least little entertaining  this first book i deleted finishing  i read  could  it funny  super annoying predictable 
2,maybe expectations high reading reviews i expected  i thought plot unrealistic even interested  i liked characters i found flipping pages get book 
2,i love books make laugh  friend told book  i paid full price  i feel somewhat  ms jensen gift humor  plotting involved book horrible  good humor element believability  book none whatsoever  with believable story line  ms jensen could among top humor writers

4,if looking humorous  contemporary romantic novel stuck with you  book  the characters well developed  even secondary ones humorous  it laughing loud parts  although plot little top  great fun easy read  perfect unwinding hard day 
3,  stuck with you  o k  the idea story cute  i thought characters woefully underdeveloped dialogue situations cheesy i couldnt help cringe  this book i ever experienced author  i wont say awful  i say wasnt  mediocre best 
3,ms jensen tried write interesting story  unfortunately i able suspend reality far enough accept premise two people exposed possible virus  what emt s people emergency room  and only room keep woman  i give book mediocre rating mediocre story    
3,the story started great promise  from beginning interesting characters situation exactly plausible almost believable  the situation forced isolation comedic potential lot development main characters  instead author used time develop sub story among secondary characters  while i enjoyed secondary sub story host interesting characters story i came away feeling main characters story always rushed focus story returned 
3,i saw cover drawn  i usually pick books based cover not sure   anyways  cute book quick read  not sure would something i would recommend  i got great price kindle  i could pass chick lit 
3,this certainly fun read  little silly side  the  virus  possibly infected seemed bit stretch  cute read non the less

2,i bought whim  first zen garden i could find  i look reviews  immediately regret upon receiving zen garden  the reviews summed nicely  the product exactly pay for image       you see gap border frame bottom piece  the tacks put  hold board border frame  you probably buy wood glue  push lightly separate border  press back together small vice 
3,i loved got  it looked nice relaxing use  the meditation book wonderful addition  unfortunately box sealed closed sand constantly escaping bottom   huge drifts  little trickles   overall  best made product 
2,the product looks really nice open  but i took zen garden box  i discovered two four feet  bottom attached sides four places  corners  along four sides  bowed loads space i pushed together glued feet back  i m keeping bottom box shipped  lest i fine white sand desk   i item work   when i leave job change work areas  i think i ll toss rather trying bring me otherwise  works advertised  really  s hard  s sand rocks tray  it s hard believe tray put sand could screwed way

2,these two short tapes consist brief description years white red relations  treaties conflicts  because brevity  little detail presented  the text interesting appears factually correct  the presentation relatively unbiased  quite interesting  it would make good audio tape  the extra loud background music simulated battlefield noise sometimes drowns text  the visual portion consists old photographs  presumably authentic detail clips old grade b movies quite far authentic  these rerun  times throughout presentation  course  bearing text  except extreme brevity overwhelming background noise  ignore visual effects derive worthwhile understanding many aspects period indian wars

2,the kindest description book would well written quite pointless  the plot paper thin characters  possible exception mr hilditch  either two dimensional borrowed  superior  works  the much touted plot twist  finally arrives  lacks irony seems contrived  william trevor best known short story writer book essentially short story padded novel  as well written  mildly diverting  piece light entertainment would acceptable  prize winning piece high literary pretensions   dickens  poe  even highsmith succeeded much better trevor seeks achieve 
2,i found basic idea book excellent true life  however  i say characters  felicia particular  beyond frustration  never privy emotions  what think plight  why never worry johnny  lover  might reject  i feel author made mistake never writing felicia s viewpoint scenes mr hilditch  we certainly know many feeling thoughts concerning felicia  never  never thoughts sinister friend    the character mr hilditch well developed  unfortunately main character  i felt much book  quarter  devoted mr hilditch s downward spiral  it almost becomes completely different story as previous reviewer mentioned  author s practice going back forth past present confusing

2,while book wonderful visual collection stunningly beautiful books journals  offers virtually guidance  make   the advice putting together complicated book non linear pages limited  steps  list supplies vague instructions  poorly edited  many grammatical mistakes typos  buy book inspiration  instruction 
3,i enjoyed book  generous use white space extended discussion make books left little room subjects interest  namely appearance artists  journals suggestions making visual enhancements journal the ideas fine  indeed  price number pages i simply expected ideas  i d recommend checking book library rather actually purchasing  i n t think grow reference

2,the slow paced  at war army    dean martin jerry lewis  first starring feature  bargain basement military farce separates team much footage  some nice moments   going my way  parody remains priceless   enough justify endless minute length  one comedy duo s weakest efforts

4,this film filled informative interviews great  this film subtitled  not great  definately worth afternoon  watch film intention filled teachings  visual cues subtitles 
4,the knowledge healing great explanations tibetan herbs  treatments etc   truly work  better deadly chemicals   used heal anything everything since yrs  correct diagnosis different pulses effective   treating illness heat cold treatments   along prayers   anyone go wrong

1,this totally different  classic albums  series dvds i love  this  classic album review  basically bunch fat old guys talking great ac dc  the clincher fact ac dc tribute band play guitar riffs album  a tribute band      i m sure great fun guys  i think people watching would rather see actual band playing songs  this dvd went way long little snippets band playing live  way much filler i thought dvd going  i recommend 
1,we know back black best albums history   really need  experts  tell us   i m big ac dc fan i would buy   
1,so release dvd say good  back black   needed remembered    put photo front cover simon wright line up  instead phil rudd  wright joined band three years recording  back black   this fact alone good omen real intentions product  make easy fast money offering nothing new classic rock album  useless 
3,it s typical s late night saturday drive in theater experience  shot grainy mm film  relatively lame  plot   excuse show lots female flesh  that   certainly  lots skin  highlighted beautiful  red haired sharon kelly  would achieve adult film success colleen brennan  her scene smoking hot  awfully close hardcore porn   it s fun watch late night  typically s it s ok  stars 
3,this book alright i feel author shouldconcentrate plot dispense puns   they regetting irritating   i started reading xanth i  hooked instantly i could n t wait next book  but i think books getting worse worse   frankly sort disappointment   i much prefer earlier books 
3,this bad book  would better author would concentrate story telling humor  including inevitable puns  i prude  there nothing wrong sexual innuendo  outright sex matter  i read plenty books sex  that said  i think whole adult conspiracy sub plot getting way proportion recent xanth books  no reads xanth books looking titillation  also  thinly veiled social relevance  anthony always complaining  cri tics  i begin wonder responding force feeding political correctness stories  there plenty fiction  even fantasy fiction  market addresses serious issues  xanth books marketted light entertainment  provide  despite  i enjoyed book  i would ve enjoyed lot without coyness pc attitude 
5,now look  i know piers anthony great author  i ve read incarnation immortality series  xanth books  mode books  apprentice adept series  but  i say  best bunch  what get cross young black mundane magical talent  year old transformed tree  three kings  mess zombies  believe  best surprises xanth years  thanks devious plotting good magician humphrey  clio muse  everybody s favorite elf  jenny world two moons  for us raised fairy tales  beats

5,i friend family history disease  he wanted current information i ordered found valuable doc
2,this muse records cd  print  among earlands weakest b  performances recorded  standard tunes like  unforgetable    europe   yes  santana hit  arranged played like elevator music goes nowhere   but moments earland shines cook s predictable combo like  sheila    kicker   thats  even earland s sidemen like eric alexander tenorsax lift overall performance quality  thia capured misic  manufactured music  for earland collectors  put cd shelf start looking earlands recordings prestige  milestone savant highnote

4,i read book first available last year e book  i definitely found inspiring  body image  sexuality inextricably linked  i found miss dodd s personal accounts struggles fascinating ultimately inspirational  buy book teenage daughter 
5,there books i recommend readers  i assume everyone tastes interests  especially area  self help   but  book covers far reaching subject  i think every woman i know could benefit  this woman talks body image regards sex  dressing  jobs  long term success  even friendships it really inspirational  changed way i looked waist  hips  thighs  butt  
3,this enjoyable film examined dynamics varied group family members dealing death loved  sadly though  i hoping something along lines  like water chocolate    chocolate    eat drink man woman   i wanted see chinese culture experienced around dining table  still   i m sorry purchase 
1,i rented thinking would interesting subject american chinese tradition u s  but i wrong  total disappointment  the story sub plots contrived  the script formulaic  even adding twist ending typical intentional  audiences likes twist movies  any viewer would n t get involved watching film  basically group chinese american siblings hang ups among others  set affluent neighborhood san francisco  portrays embarrassingly rich family showing amenities matriarch s sprawling extravagant house  tennis  dip pool  jacuzzi anyone  jeez  i would n t recommend movie anyone 
3,the set looks nice elegant  i problems glasses  s shaker bugs  there s bit leak try shake  but worse  glass gets wet gets really slippery  extra  let slip hands i m probably going buy another shaker put away looks something 
3,the glasses absolutely fabulous  very s   retro they texture ribbing kind the glass shaker pits   the top n t stay well great likelyhood could fly off but value still glasses 
2,while i like looks set lot  retro feel  i find shaker need design overhaul  every time used  s used several people i n t think s user problem  spills pouring  this frustrating lose good top shelf vodka poor design  i go purchase another shaker problem i would recommend set 
4,i got similar set   pc shaker  glasses   i agree reviews shaker  leaks little bit  i suggest getting another shaker  keeping around back up or wrapping small towel around leaky seam  i like texture shaker glasses  it s classy overdone s tacky 
1,the set cute look  far actually using  terrible  the glasses fine  shaker hard use  i actually took chunk finger trying get open refill  i ve never used 
2,at pages  over priced course adults  as basic instruction  probably okay  for anyone even doodles talking phone forget 
4,i took class bruce mcintyre maybe  i enjoyed much buying drawing book brought back memories i learned  he makes drawing much easier i thought showing easy things use make picture life  a friend borrowed books class i never got back i moved i elated get drawing textbook amazon  yea   
5,drawing textbook bruce mcintyre required art class i m  i like laid easy follow away class  i love i able find amazon com i could get copy  it helps i n t try follow along several others time 
5,this book i expected   pictures lovely  really makes visit alaska n t certainly enjoy book    
2,the set shipped carrying case covered oil like substance either oil case smelled horrendous  also  punches dull uniformly sharpened  dulled  however look   i difficulties cutting even thin  soft silicone sheets  sharpening rotary tool helps  i feel i n t brand  new  product  i sure actually repackaged   i n t imagine using metal  let alone rubbers  despite affordable price  i would not purchased set reasons 
2,received great time i problem seller    but  the inside case lists types materials cut including metals  i got for one punch softga copper sheet edges punch bent  areas  flaked  the second disk i cut completely  i file edges probably would easier cut sheet shears so  metals however  i see would great leather  paper  plastics to worth money spent chance would actually cut metal disks 
1,i purchases set simple craft projects   mainly cut card stock cardboard  i tried hammering punches oz  hammer n t go card stock  got husbands big beefy hammer   still punch thin card stock  i disappointed product  glad i n t pay lot   complete waste 
3,pretty decent tool use around house reasonable price average quality  it s ok home use 
1,well i n t usually write reviews i feel need productrst  they caked mud   s nd  they dulli guess sharpened  we ll see
2,i really dont give product bad rating simple tool supposed  but serious safety flaw problem    the kit came instructions  i figuring worked  i turning screw side barrel  sharp pointed  inch pin needle inside barrel shot like projectile dart  it spring loaded screw held in luckily wasnt aimed anyone  could caused serious injury  after pin shot i left feeling disturbed tool could taken eye out so  i feel compelled warn advise others might buying tool set 
2,listen sound bite buy  i n t  i  this way modern  i like cool west coast jazz  sort ornette coleman meets karlheinz stockhausen  modern tone  if bag  album  otherwise pass 
3,product nice   years old daughter love  boots looooong  ok  n t wash tha washer machine  hand  fabric extremely delicated  buy daughter lot fun
3,i purchased costume   year old daughter wants purple  action hero  halloween i could find purple  the costume cute  i took package  stuck together  half purple wanted badly came skirt i pulled costume apart  also boots way high  my daughter taller average long legs  reviewer right boots go high  right shirt  like shown picture  i think costume cheaply made price  daughter loves i guess okay 
4,got amazon daughter s superhero party  she could hardly wait put  the quality ok  parts  like skirt  gotten stuck together color bit  for costume though  ll serve good purpose  provide hours fun  the boots really high  my daughter tall age  boots go way  even  skirt  just fyi 
4,a useful history last days soviet rule early days democracy russia  told stories several  mostly prominent individuals  it provides nice portrait exists  lacks deep analysis answer question 
5,highly recommended  this book gives stunning history soviet union much personal account people live  this truly must read anyone interested russia problems faces today
2,book pages print small difficult try read i returned  perhaps ever comes kindle i would try 
2,book text book studying soviet history  author assumes reader well informed  certainly better informed  drops names mostly meaningless impossible put context  vocabulary beyond college level  know word  ramify   didn t but positive side remnick done remarkable research  put situations put risk  descriptions graphic frightening  courageous i read first half  could n t continue  part hard file 
5,mr remnick given us masterwork  he seamlessly meshes intimate portraits soviet citizens within larger landscape last days soviet empire  he rare ability blend micro macro soul stirring narrative  this profound work filled compelling stories  lenin s tomb superb even avoid  history books  relish  could highly recommend book  the scads glowing reviews well deserved 
4,great book lots great anecdotes small  personal biographies power capitalists entered russian business scene communist turned last page 
5,this revealing perhaps revealing account last days soviet union put forth concise manner reader  it smooth flowing  vivid descriptions captured mood time authentic way  the reliance interviews gives lot credibility narration portrayal character situations found  the society whole bared reader understand system s shortcomings exposed  i read the union muzhik day  understand hopes perestroika glasnost demise soviet union failed bring people 
3,remnick tells good story   accurately  series short  personalized stories  last days soviet empire  i looking insights     buried much narrative  he receives rave reviews gives good  first hand  eye witness account what  happened  but i struggled find why  happened  i struggled finish book 
3,the binder i received covers meet  the back cover sticks  inch front cover binder closed  hopefully  others 
5,i bought binder hold page anatomy book published unbound  probably could held least two books size  it s huge  the pockets  d rings  opening mechanism top quality when measuring much space ll need binder bookshelf  backpack  etc  remember rings four inches  binder even wider  close five inches  the side binder rings non negotiably need much room 
1,i bought binder started middle school  withing first week  set rings close properly carefully go notebook papers n t fall  everything gets stuck point rings n t completely close  poorly made product 
5,i keep equipment manuals owners  guides  needed add volume  the others bought  i worried i might able get durable quality  i worried needlessly  these usual avery standards 
1,i relatively high tolerance level bad flicks  beyond tolerable  if check credits movie appears producer hired family friends actors  summary  intended   horrific acting  i could acted scenes better called actors  frightful script  talks like anyway  the zombies breaching stronghold  i would advise seek alternative egress route order address impending conflict   brain blending effects  nothing like karate kick missed  inches yet knocks zombie window  my review interesting movie  give camcorder amazon makeup kit  shameless plug  i could done movie  there nothing redeeming   nothing 
2,you figure zombie movies least years date still n t produce low budget zombie movie better actors  the dialogue good presentation sucked  like reading dialogue instead experiencing  the plot good well  this movie elements well made zombie flick chomped token lesbian black chick  good try i wanted 
4,  z  follow up feature  nightfall  tempest  it s jolly fun scare ride throughout  never know undead creatures  i hope s spoiler  may lurking  it reminds saturday afternoon matinee horror flick  full thrills action  dashes humor   z  film perfect halloween  relentless chase pursuit characters try survive  knowing way turn  also  interestingly  creatures old school  ll hear smell i mean  
3,for movie looks like cost  make  it ok typical zombie film  but good film people anything zombie 
4,this cool fast paced indie zombie movie  would defiantly recommend friends family see film  would like see company could given opportunity second third zombie film  oh disclaimer film zombies hurt filming movie pretty neat 
1,lower low budget horrible dialogue acting  two six year olds could done better couple kindergarten actors
2,in past  family purchased three videos series loved them  this dvd advertised six segments cover amazon s advertising  three interrupted segments disc received  in  contexts stories missing title segment pair intended support educational message  has anyone else problem defective discs  we returning amazon asap  hope get corrected discs 
2,item sizing consistent  had make modifications wear make fit  cheap torn could even use

3,i ordered stall shower rod  it works  barely much better i suspect curtain rod nice finish  lightly made  word spindly comes mind 
2,the picture seems show somewhat robust rod  get thin      rod  when exteneded near mazimum length becomes flimsy barely hold small shower curtain without bowing middle  i would expected little better price intended use  but  works s black 
1,this rod flimsy stall shower stay minutes curtain  we put least four times fell  i returned  color nice  extremely thin 
2,the pieces attach shower wall small  because  rod never stays place  
5,this great rod need little space  it stylish sturdy  the accents bring charater plain rods  had strong resistance stays walls  holds material curtain well liner hase n t budged  love rod would buy 
3,this curtain rod used shower stall curtain rod  i found small diameter unlike plastic versions offered bed  bath  beyond  it twist snug fitting walls  i expect fall daily use 
2,this rod way small use shower curtain  i idea even comes search  it may work simple curtain  i doubt 
3,i like fact i get tension rod black  too bad style appears option  these rods look nice  distance  appearance wrought iron  stay put long  they loosen  causing anything lightest curtain  also  little cap comes slip curtain rings attached twist elongate shorten rod  not good design cost double worth  get stay  look quite nice 
2,this curtain rod looks nice  barely hold weight  it work sheers 
2,umbra coretto inch decorative tension rod  blackthe rod really good looking  however  thin  weight shower curtain keeps causing rod loose  if i idea  i probably would bought rod  however  shower wider   so maybe person would better luck shower closer   
3,as anticipated new technotronic project  new single disappointing  it good beats  fairly repetitive uninspired  it definitely lacks creativity personality  influence  tt s projects ya kid k  this cd  mixes song  instrumental  minus freestyle overdubbing monday midnite

4,i love korean food i found difficult find good vegetarian korean cookbook i stumbled onto terrific book  i found fun easy prepare vegetarian many vegan recipes unique book 
4,i enjoyed a f  s books enough buy  although nearly practical  the sections buy clothes date  designed people far money  actually  i n t know book published originally since  money shop stores  probably already know  it almost seems like matter credentialing  knows i would buy a f  s books looking s clothing guide  however  subject matter really interests  find a f  s books covers much ground  slightly different ways  value reading  including 
2,i agree previous reviewer  this book like cliff notes book s fashion  tradition  style  etc  the half book relatively useless  unless  course  re millionaire  world traveller  the prose humorous times becasue s pretentious  bordering effeminate niles crane  still  imporatnt basice male fashion rules established history tradition  discussed book  wishes adhered regularly  the first half book serviceable  authoritative  flusser comes somewhat foppish picture dustjacket would lead question taste  nothing else  haircuts  i would consider better book  far lavish detail illustrations  gentlemen  a timeless fashion   recently published 
1,  book shop  locations noted chicago  houston  florence  milan  nyc  vienna  etc  beijing  shanghai hong kong   the rest spoiled pompous  overbearing style makes unreadable 
2,i bought book year ago  mainly high ratings  but i disappointed  i read i found style writing outdated content useful  many addresses buy things  useful  i n t live nearby places  i learn why buy certain things i decide good buy  such info given briefly 
1,what live outside new york  this book n t applicable anyone outside  the city   buy book john bridges instead 
4,if re seeking information tell fine menswear bad  skip book go directly flusser s new one if re would be dandy looking information buy s furnishings around world  buy book  minor caution   many stores u s relocated closed on hand  i ve used find choices london paris i would never known otherwise  and ve made initial investment measurements  patronize many establishments telephone a number earlier reviews criticise flusser focusing finest quality expensive clothing world  it   but people play game  s still best source information 
4,as noted many reviewers  clothing fact information first rate the second part book shopping retail establishments date i really question whether purchase worthwhile retailer information primary purpose proposed purchase  a good  information establishments us london totally outdated stores gone business try library borrowing friend see desired information still relevant purchasing  this book needs serious update

2,i n t actually album  i buy apple venus  i ll say  i hope album charm album lacked  i ve never disappointed xtc album  why would buy album exact songs  except demo form  a shoddy attempt extract money  seems  shame  xtc 
2,recipes bit strange easy follow  i would n t recomment book time anyone serious cooking 
3,it interesting read ancestors wrote recipes  some interesting i must admit  some i never see ever wanting make much less eat times tastes certainly change 
2,the price right mugs great shape easy handling  i wish i could say buy  but   rims chip easily  someone else stated review followed advice 
4,i ve making morning tea mugs several years  problem pouring boiling water yet   mate using occasionally beer long they work well tea beer  thick glass raised foot help keep liquids right temperature  sixteen ounces bottle long steeping teabags worth my problem rims chip dishwasher  i dont  know s dishwasher  i put next heavy arcoroc glasses  i ve found three far slice taken edge   which i smooth diamond wand   anchor hocking actually redesigned less flared lip couple years ago  may know problem   the new ones chip  often

1,a complete disappointment waste time  the narrator could n t seem less interested  almost though bothered project  look somewhere else sports hypnosis cd 
5,i read antony beevor got hooked stalingrad  book good beevor s  it good hayward s new book admiral nelson  both get high praise  scholarly works readable far  make guy s work 
5,i enjoyed book much  i got gift brought copy give someone else  it  thorough  makes ideal academics  easy enthusiasts like understand get absorbed  and i  even though i naturally knew stalingrad battle ended i still felt gripped dreadful story unfolded  mr hayward managed make events understable characters believable  i felt frustration pain growing feelings failure terrible disappointment  this book goes well alongside beavor s equally important study battle  stalingrad enthusiasts simply must copies  especially hayward s first explain air operations  brilliantly  beavor s first look fate ordinary soldiers sides 
5,i read book part study i eastern front i found book excellently researched well written  for interested military history particular german military history  i would say s must good bookshelf
5,i agree esteemed professor richard overy said review book   this model kind  ought set agenda reconstruction air narrative theatres greatest wars   but i go  book n t even mainly narrative  it s powerfully strong piece operational level analysis  it written lively captivating way  makes density analysis easy cope  i rate work highly 
5,this volume major contribution history luftwaffe russo germano   stopped stalingrad  richly drawn study important air campaigns eastern front  written accessible style volume welcomed anyone interest wwii  i pleasantly surprised book quality contents  the author masterful job research  joel hayward draws diaries key commanders regular airmen  he shows poorly conceived strategies hitler buffoon  goering  dommed efforts manstein  milch wolfram richthofen  outstanding soldier  grips impossible situation  i heartily recommended book 
4,i ve read tremendous amount subject ww ii history  rarely i read book anything new tell  this book class well written  the two points i found interesting discussion original focus hitler s campaign russia first extensive history i ve read airlift effort save paulus th army trapped stalingrad  he offers original research  question promised hitler luftwaffe could sustainth army airlift    successful soviets interfering airlift  for anyone interested history ww ii eastern front  book must read 
3,a mediocre historian  most facts quotes based diary  for whatever reasons trusts nazi published facts numbers soviets  the good news unlike books describes detail luftwaffe 
2,seeking knowledge sufism main reason reading catching thread  the description sufism scattered chapters put pieces together satisfying way  just chapter summarizing basics would made difference  the amount dream material excessive  why extensive case examples  it impossible judge quality dream interpretation  given limited information dreamers  most applications jungian concepts seemed appropriate  for unfamiliar jungian psychology  book serves useful introduction 
1,the title video mentions argentine tango  unfortunately  taught tape authentic argentine tango  not even close  it s ballroom tango  there huge difference  music  style  steps  posture  etc   do n t fooled ballroom instructors trying teach argentine tango  the authentic instruction available market comes authentic argentine instructors buenos aires 
5,after receiving librero s tapes  the big band swing the latin argentine tango  gift  husband i believe easy learn dance  neither us dancers blanche emilio made fun simple us learn  now dance dances always wanted  plus good time practicing friends  we enjoy music cds part package  well cue cards 
2,this version tango argentine  it ballroom latin american whatever call  very misleading call argentine tango  but like ballroom dancing  maybe video 
5,i intermediate dancer dances  beginner others  i found librero s dance series  big band latin  helpful providing overall understanding similarities differences popular dances  their argentine tango section would specially good beginners  most videos i seen dance frustrating overwhelming  the music cd inspiring tempos good practice convenient  i definitely recommend librero s series  particularly beginner dancer 
2,video lot dances learning dance  steps dont expect much teaching video   steps buy videos exclusively particular dance  video wet appetite fill hunger   background setting video dark inside dark night club see footsteps teachers wearing black pants blend dark background  terrible  plus teachers teach side camera sometimes facing camera  ideal way teach dance video  teachers back camera follow footwork  money charge video worth 
2,there things i n t like tape  firstly  price high  secondly tape inconvenient spoiled technology user  it s much easier work dvds menus  and lastly  i realized i d rather spend dollars  monthly group lessons learn basic steps routines dance try master watching tape 
5,i buy wiley s guide every year always find right money comes rating rides  recommending hotels  giving tips extras like meet characters  what separates book disney guides s realistic   the unoffical guide lays itinerary would kill anyone kids official guide sugary light  never telling handle crowds heat things factor re disney world  wiley hits middle ground  s positive obviously knows  loves  stuff ll give facts 
5,i bought version order newest edition  i disney world years i idea go  the book right every detail  i especially like ride advice little ones recommendations  if planning trip  buy book first

3,this first book cassie edwards i read i bit disappointed  i always liked read american native people even  i living faraway states  many things look untrue strange  first  picture front page  looks thunder heart hair  as i know indians shave theirselves  second  i think worrier chief thunder heart could involved many unimportant things  even   love  however  unusual character bill  i believe bill  could change much  who says everything must fine 
1,it s rather amusing harmonica band  whatever hell  decided give album title greatest rock albums history  styx  pieces eight   and mr   please push sales  wrote  review   i bet cover art n t quite good incredible hypgnosis masterpiece styx album

2,this dvd trilogy box contains two disc editions sm   single disc edition spidey   however   available separately  disc sets  i d surprised  n t given  disc treatment right christmas  so   disc editions  movies available box  think ultimate matrix collection   buy  this box skipped 
2,personally i would not buy trilogy spiderman  horrible    great though   good 
2,great picture quality  cool  blu ray premier format seamless feature interaction  high storage capacity bonus material    except spider man  special features  aside  stuff   great use space  thanks perks  br so  i wonder  really worth  pick

5,this  package dvd arrived perfect condition rather quickly  had problems seller  pleased  always would recommend buy seller 
5,when i need product i spend lot time research  not costs product shipping handling charges important speed  accuracy dependability company person involved  i highly recommend source checked searching specific products 
2,spider man   does include amazing behind scenes content originally released dvds  why would studio release two extraordinary fx films magnitude incredible production values format hold much information  fail include extras  if re fan behind scenes content  hold onto dvds movie  a  blu ray value spider man    fail

5,this excellent historical work modern pagan witchcraft  it tend focus wicca  talk druids  non gardnarian traditions  if know nothing wicca  i recomend start another book  last chapter serves excelent summary wiccans belive  though seams weird suggest  might read last chapter first  although author historian pagan witch  remains respectful historical endevor  this book excelent example new religion born  perhapse history birth new faith exist 
1,idotic credit robert graves inventing goddess  false authority  beware  sounds impressive shoots self foot repeatedly 
2,small print  difficult read  but wait  i might learn something  so i use magnifier plug away  nope  boring  there absolutely reason research presented simply  well  maybe author wanted impress academics obscure  i hope succeeded  but n t ordinary people understand history development neo paganism  there lots  better written  accessible  books better job 
5,i finished reading book  i  however  found hard put  it engaging  comprehensive enjoyable read  i heard book recommended sales people city halifax it without doubt informative accurate history witchcraft  i know preferred books history witchcraft 
3,when book came library  first thought   wow   finally   serious scholarship subject   and work eminently cited many books subject  s neither easy read particularly ground breaking arguments makes history provides now i say i stranger books published academic presses  however  readability matter i find accessible person overwhelmed academic reading in short  someone searching brief  realistic  readable history wicca witchcraft  i would suggestbonewits s essential guide witchcraft wicca  covers much ground  history witchcraft ancient  pre modern  modern times development wicca  much readable still serious tone style 
4,this veyr detailed informative history  however paperback edition miniscule print low grade paper  much hard read long period time  i would reccomend getting hardback  the work great s worth paying extra able read without needing aspirin standby 
3,as mac user  i say cable essential anyone wants utilize syncing features imovie sony handycam  the usb connector came packed hc40 completely useless trying connect imovie this essentially reason i n t give higher rating three stars  it definitely frustrating find investing decent personal use camera  sony expected buy still stuff make even connect computer  if i purchase ridiculous sony retail price   frustrating  would ve mild descriptor  amazon s discount helped soften insult beyond  i n t say whole heckuva lot  s cable   ha 
2,works described  i annoyed sony would lure buying video camera competitive price without including cable  making overall cost camera longer competitive  it s smart sony conduct business way  order earn profit short term  you bet i n t suckered buying sony products future  knowing run business 
3,this another way sony make another  purchase video camera  imagine surprise finding i purchase separate cable order create dvd s dv camera  as far cable goes  fine  but  sure would give sony favorable talk part included cable i buy camera 
5,this product worked exactly supposed  i tried using cable came camera  usb cord  found exactly many others said blogs    it does n t work    once i got cable  worked perfectly  i able easily download video camera computer  the frustration i i would rather paid little camera gotten cable first place 
1,cable sold ability transfer video camcorder pc it n t  i spoke company told cable  i asked thet advertised cable able told i known better  they charged  cable back  you would smart shop elsewhere  they n t know products charge lack knowledge 
2,it worked month  even work hit miss thing  i fool  maybe i bought cheapest available  maybe knock off  knows  i yet try another computer rule cord  fair warning 
2,if new computer maybe newer cable work working older like n t work  so i wonderful cable waiting get upgraded computer match 
1,i spent couple hours  trying get transfer dv camcorder mac powerbook  after hours hours i realize usb cable delivered sony camcorder absolutely worthless  if n t sony vaio  opinion overdesigned peace fancy gear i link connection  pc mac  getting frustrated pretty quick  i would given cable  star rating  way i get cable  buy seperately  big rip  however i found exact cable apple store called  thin fire wire   the exact cable   meter   pin exact   works fine  so check apple store near save money shame sony 
4,good dampener  i bought head racketyrs oldthe reason bought racket getting little annoying noises serveso tried sounds gone good price

2,i bought dvd mozart symphony   however  difficult access work  i finally figured way fast forward final movement lebrun concerto  this problem evidence several different dvd players track dvds region code  there wonderful performances series  too bad engineering poor 
2,when first heard deviant  thought would something great  judging previous records way ps developed musical style   but finally listening thru suddenly realised ps trying go mainstream  their new cd much alike korn limp bizkit music terryifing  i could n t understand ps chose opt electronics towards punk rock style  in general cd good tracks   exact   deliver goods like previous cd s  i am sorely dissapointed 
2,the pitchshifter sound forged last  releases  culminating wonderfully  www pitchshifter com  stripped watered down sound could bands wasting time  money  days  the pitchshifter formula brutal guitars mixed programed drums industrial electronic affects unlike anything else musical scene  that sound completely gone cd  reducing punishing onslaught something mtv would little problem broadcasting  a disappointing cd 
5,i eagerly anticipated release album  knowing whatever came would excellent  musically  dramatic change compared albums pitchshifter com  infotainment  i like somewhat mellow approach many songs  dont get discouraged  still heavier stuff like  keep clean     dead battery     wafer thin    personal favorites  they keep getting better better every release  people complain going mainstream  change times   at first resembled favorite bands  ministry  look  stepped away  unique blend techno  rock  industrial  plain  lyrically musically  outdone rock  industrial band time  this album best date  psi rocks
2,when i ordered product  i n t see size chart i sent size suitable purpose intended

4,ra really underrated rock band  they great melodies  good arganments  middle eastern vibe  singer really influenced sting police  they even cover songs  if breaking benjamin alter bridge  band  every song great  really weak tracks  i highly recommend cd 
3,i agree reviewers say from one better album  do n t get wrong  decent effort  i feel like rate songs scale  almost songs would around     good  high enough point disc still getting regular play cd player  months year 
4,i enjoyed album  at first glance appears standard post s rock album  but good listen  realize succeeded forging rather good unique album  it s well done good shelf life due distinctive sound 
4,while ra s first cd alot heavier  laid back  i like heavy lighter styles music  i would say cd better musically first one visionclothingco com
4,ra interesting band watch grow  their first release  from one  excellent debut showed potential  its album immediately digested loving time  with  duality  band still lyrically strong  stronger  however  instrumental wise  band fallen generic hole need climb  not say instrumental album awful   means  it n t stand nearly much debut album  i ve album since first week came  there tracks immediately get  mostly first half  rest fall away first listen  over time though grow appreciate rest album  i least 
5,for read review  from one   pretty much i said review repeat  this excellent cd  though toned  from one   still rocks  you n t go wrong ordering both time  s i   btw  i think ra  every little thing she does is magic  better police originally      
3,i loved first cd  regular genric  there absolutely nothing wrong songs   each song similar next  time got chills sang   cd sing uniquely second back chrous    sigh happened  the songs newer album okay  liked lyrics  missing special something   oh well 
4,this album  course  builds themes first  sahaj lot say  n t done saying  plenty texture style made first album listenable  lyrically surprising  may find coming unexpected point song turns something different say first impressions indicated  another reviewer mentioned seem stuck single pattern songwriting structure  i n t disagree  i m willing cut slack sophomore album  we ll see get bit adventurous third album 
2,when i first heard ra s  from zero  i awe  a band used cool effects  egyptian scales  moderately heavy  perfect mix  then  duality came out duality demonstrates lack creativity ra  i would n t say evolved  i d say devoled  they still use effects  rarely n t big impact  on top hardly sound egyption album  as album  ra sounds like bands  still distinct  i wish went different direction i say really awesome songs like fallen angels  undertaken  taken  the tracks bad either  s i expected whole lot 
4,i found band looking information trixter found pj farley band  listened ra website bought cd day  i found band lately took away like ra i heard first album next list  since i got duality today stopped listening    ra rocks    
3,keeping mind ra n t highly complex  i think safe say pleasant surprise  still even though i feel need get gears moving order escape fate nu metal bands  they well balanced band brings good lyrics musicianship remake  every little thing she does magic   i pleased money spent 
2,well  i might agreed reviewers i n t ordered  strength ball training  goldenberg twist time  this book seems amateurish today s standards  it s thin paperback hand drawn sketches  maybe considered okay back   sbt gives exercises book plus many  updated recent training science background  illustrated photographs actual people  plus dvd videos illustrating many exercises  and s price  come  get century  amateur productions like n t cut anymore 
4,great resource anyone looking add variety medicine ball exercises  increase overall explosiveness intense physical activity 
3,album ok  beats weak  lyrics rap mechanics great   but album lacks many areas   recommended desperate hip hop listeners 
1,the book written progressives attempt rewrite history christian heritage americans signed declaration independence constitution  this scholarly work  it footnotes reference  it debunked scholars next year written  it interesting reading understand effort authors people represent would go advance political agenda  it unfactual book distorts truth  with understanding  people read scholarly books understand christian legacy people 
4,let first reviewer since  weigh valuable book  every american reacted horrors day personal way many reflected secular foundations constitution people know details struggle went conception  codification defense first amendment  the separation church state greatest source strength country  every american know struggle roger williams  history southern baptists  strong belief founding fathers freedom choice regarding personal beliefs  all explained simple scholarly book 
1,i would like note look footnotes book got information  shred evidence back  they simply state forgone traditional footnotes believe phd  i know i writing type paper gentlemen college would fail i n t show i got information  furthermore  there texas world s largest collection artifacts founding fathers loads evidence point extreme opposite  in fact copy bibles printed distributed every family america funding congress  i would encourage anyone sees watch documentary called  monumental  kirk cameron  exposes truth constitution writers points damage books like caused society 
1,this book used colleges across america  contains almost primary source quotes  footnotes  endnotes  thus scholarly support s assertions  did author even bother read founders  letters  speeches  published works  etc  probably  bc actual quotes founded country would really get way made speculation  hearsay  biased opinions masquerading historical fact  pathetic

1,this old chestnut book put misery  it s written style tone authority  careful reading shows hopelessly slanted  on every significant point involves historical uncertainty controversy  authors unquestioningly accept left wing labor point view cynically disparage totally ignore interpretation  this labor s  untold  story reputable historians ever nerve write openly propagandistic book  academic labor historians think book wonderful merely showing left wing ideological colors  there much better objective accounts

1,the author apparently theory relating unexplained phenomena  ll never figure reading book  he strings together repetitive descriptions  unexplained  events  without coherent narrative structure the book filled ludicrous claims  scientists know    studies shown   of course s support claims do n t waste time book 
2,garbage  the author different lunatics running around country chasing lights  the difference guy wrote book  watch x files instead 
3,the movie condensed  changed movies often  book  the book sort kinds stuff  it kept losing 
1,two hundred pages book  i m still waiting cogent theme emerge  poorly written  poorly documented  thin   words  perfect fodder commercial movie 
1,i enjoy reading  unexplained phenomena   i really  i love  real  ghost stories like  however  i prefer author scientific stance  exhausting possibilities  keel  he s  true believer   s problem somewhere book supposes mysterious mothman could hang glider   wow   i thought   that could almost construed logical   however  immediately debunks theory statement affect   but hang gliders well known time    shaking head whatever   needed become familiar occam s razor 
2,the mothman story indeed fascinating  unfortunately  adjective applied  the mothman prophecies   john keel s theories regarding nature origin ufos general mothman particular bizarre phenomena  i put mr keel s tedious obsession  black  behaving badly i ve given singularly overrated book two stars  rather  supply  albeit nowhere near enough  information extraordinary occurrences years ago 
2,i wanted read seeing film  wow  bore  keel s book reads like scatter shot diary narrator  maybe stuff revelatory back originally published  x files cultural phenomena media ufos paranormal floating around  seems pedestrian comparison  the descriptions always  only names change chapter sighting contacting also  do not read this book seeing movie  it sap enjoyment mark pellington s excellent film  fact  i amazed well screenwriter richard hatem took dross put narrative structure around  s another review belongs elsewhere    
3,while book contained interesting stories  aliens  abduction scenarios  disjointed step  keel bounces unrelated story next  i n t life understand ridiculous  energy beings  theory ufo s  i could gather ideas  makes people think dark side moon inhabited aliens seem almost mainstream  despite frustration mr keel s writing style theories  i would still recommend book anyone interested paranormal 
2,i found movie leading many directions   why john s wife appearing point pleasent  was mothman  why john appear gordon  nights  a m  these questions never answered movie    i miss something  the movie ran long  maybe loose ends  i could wrong  decide  go see movie    
2,i usually like books better movie  it interesting book although touches everything seems repeat time time  the movie focused actual  mothman  i felt book mentioned among many things  this book named  mothman  men in black  ufos  kitchen sink   i glad done book  do n t waste money book  check library 
5,having read least books ufos related phenomena   the mothman prophecies  become favorites along jacques vallee  this classic must read reaches unpopular likely true conclusion ufos n t outer space psychic nature 
3,i found book fairly interesting  times reader becomes bogged down history sightings the book would better reading focused personal level investigated personal aspects unique sightings changed people town  if expect find movie within book  forget  not  overall  lukewarm reading 
2,there lots  obvious reasons  i forgotten i remember lot instamatic cameras  mm movie cameras around i guess question  why pictures thing  i believe good people point pleasant saw something least reported sightings  mothman  i simply accept author s statement camera s newspeople took along failed work reason other the movie excellent based entirely wacky book written kind random fashion good first place   show pictures   
2,i expected  least hoped  less straightforward account mothman phenomenon years ago  instead  meandering book comprises  hick  ufo sightings infrequently connected mothman  keel s trust me i know what i m talking about theories explanations  i particularly dismayed seemingly endless accounts  black  behaving badly  with little recommend  aside providing details mothman sightings  s recommendation    the mothman prophecies  considerable disappointment 
4,as many reviewers said  book n t chronological order put forth kind explanation mysterious events describes  i rather disappointed  you catch glimpses keel might thinking comments throughout  enough know  example  n t buy extraterrestrial invasion theory thinks things people see naturally occurring phenomena people n t aware  never really sits explains length  despite wealth information s gathered thought about however  anecdotes experiences presented interesting  sheer wealth similarity  compelling  the nonlinear format might helped make interesting ways  even distracted others 
1,let start saying  mothman prophecies  novel  coherent story  it starts strong  enough draw  goes spectral energy crap hole  were led believe mr keel sensiable  unbiased investigator  really s parinoid delusional whack  i m  i n t buy word    see movie instead 
2,excellent suspenseful information  all place far material  we travel back forth west virgina london ohio   back  would enjoyed first part book supporting information phenomena indeed appeared elsewhere history  phenomena ties ufo sightings etc  keel s hypothesis paranormal activity comes parallel universe difficult believe  even paranormal studies  i m sure first although book suspenseful written well  organized poorly  revise  john  you 
3,overall entertaining thought provoking book  very little mentioned mothman compared ufos  mib  stange lights cattle mutations  i find keels thoughts vampires  angels ufos entity interesting  i kept finding wondering keel overly paranoid  however may well point  are people encounter ufo s paranoid powers work make us think paranoid  now  i m sounding paranoid  because book  i continue read ufo s  reason i liked book 
1,25 pages covering men black  lights sky  phone troubles  pages mothman  if read old s ufo stories  book  if read mothman  buy something else 
1,normally  i prefer books movies  mothman prophecies boring  unbelievable  non fiction  the story product author s imagination  perhaps  novel first copywritten  spectacular  to thinking purchasing book   especially viewing movie  i d say pass  purchase vhs dvd 
3,this book   starts little slow  author focuses solely the mothman peoples  accounts  looked like   etc   for first pages author pretty much lists interviewsst hand accounts contactees experiences  though th page  i n t knowth page   book gets really interesting  things start happening personally john keel  it seems though  begins find  deeper goes things  things begin get way stop  it becomes apparent someone something n t know knows  yet persists  a good book lives 
1,have i quit reading book i made page i stop  i ve waited years read  oh i disappointed i thought would intelligent well written peice mothman mystery  i n t know  holy mackeral  ve never seen bad writing  someone else mentioned incoherent  tell  this place  i absolutely clue going book  just crazy  just favourites   horrified dropped small baby arms  the child began cry  insulted hurt     i m thinking kids hurt insulted  this keel dude much   talking  mysterious  guy tiny witness said saw wire running pant leg  quote  tiny wearing electric socks  wired android operated remote control       pretty much i stopped mind turned mush
1,i n t get  i thought book story paranormal town needed buy raid also anybody tell moths n t grow big   june bugs well s story 
2,the subject matter fascinating potential make exciting  fast moving read  unfortunately presentation disorganized  repetetive boring  i force finish thing ended wondering heck point meant  i certainly n t feel i acquired clear understanding happened point pleasant  i n t even get enough decide whether i believe stories  if book  borrow someone save money 
2,john keel s  mothman prophecies  could great book actually concentrated  mothman  sightings around point pleasant  west virginia mid to late s  unfortunately  book n t really mothman  instead entitled  john keel explains universe really works   for every  mothman  story keel relates book  offers least three stories personal life  adventures researching paranormal  decidedly offbeat theories paranormal events causes  this book n t really  mothman  sightings west virginia much goofy memoir john keel s  research  world ufos  demons  ghosts  bizarre events  as someone bought book read  mothman  keel s disjointed ramblings ravings  i sorely disappointed  not recommended 
1,this book not like movie  in fact  i prefer movie  the book composed bits pieces john keel s others  phenomenal experiences  it difficult read  bad press printing  clipped disjointed  i bought book delve seeing movie  ended confused  go movie  forget book 
3,i thought book informative reader  it s first book i read mothman  ufos i interested phenomena  the content book good  i think could organized little better  it would helped author told story chronological order  there much dialog  enjoy reading book filled desccription  book would probably appeal  do expect book like movie s  goes detail  the book interesting gave john keel s opinion happened point pleasant 
4,john keel s  the mothman prophecies  follows usual form ufology books  he presents large collection anecdotes  personal observations experiences  mixes debunking woo scientific mind  throws ancient gods goddesses  references fairies  variety religious  sightings   this course genre  puts reviewer mind charlie brown s standard beginning tales   it dark stormy night   despite rather disorganized somewhat repetitive presentation   fairly standard genre   keel relates narrative earnestly  engage interest  men black  saucer shaped vehicles diamond shaped windows   thyroid like eyes   if gets attention  ll enjoy  the mothman prophecies   the recent movie based loosely keel s research  way  fail satisfy informed ufology readers 
2,ok  seen movie  us read keel s book  reprint   what seems mention fine print located copyright page  reads   this work fiction  all characters events portrayed book either products author s imagination used fictitiously   if n t believe  glance copyright page  obviously  paperback edition prepared movie tie in  touted  true event  publisher informs us work  author s imagination   and therein must lie lot truth  yes  book mildly entertaining  bit choppy parts  my advice  read the mothman prophecies large dose salt  movie much better  
4,i never interested ufo literature  decided give book try  the early portions book rather dry documentations ufo sightings paranormal incidents  towards book however  things pick considerably  the author s description events credible eerie  he concludes so called extraterrestrial  beings really us earth perceived perceptual abilities us  he concludes beings capable influencing interfering humans  for books outside ufo literature corroborate mr keel s conclusions i recommend  the active side infinity  carlos castaneda     far journeys  robert monroe     the path  esmeralda arana  
5,i read first s never forgotten  i pleased reprinted i wanted read  it holds surprisingly well  keel realized things ufo phenomena  researchers beginning understand  if sense wonder  get  if researcher  get  if open minded skeptic  give better perspective  if re looking entertainment  s lot fun 
5,beautifully made perfect restorative yoga  i could n t happier  i several products hugger mugger always choose product available bolsters  meditation cushions  etc 
1,item stated look like stock graphics  picture show item looks like  dont count good quality product
4,i first heard m i a  recreation hall university s campus mixer great sound system  filled entire downstairs upstairs sweet vibes   i agree points positive reviews  great beats  lyrics  vocals  likes there thing keep mind buying judging album  almost requires good sound system music feeds bass  like many  dance  genres  bass heavy component making tracks work  exception  the vocal great  difficulty standing alone without heavy bass  thus  re like two simple speakers default sound card  might reconsider buying album risk slight disappointment for  upsetting difference  i know songs could  i would recommend high quality speakers sound card woofer  else re missing  big time 
5,she genius  lot say  s worth hearing  hard to categorize music absolutely grows becomes favorite album weeks sinks  sound fun   considering lots toy instruments used  number producers m i a  relevant  interesting makes pay attention buy album 
4,for little tricky  i know next nothing type dance music  i really criteria judge mia but i like low frequencies  quite shock rock jazz guy  i like singer s voice  sing quite speed  shi lankin accent  emphasis placed interesting places  all little moans music noices remind jazz  i like little eletronic ambers burn tracks as sound  quite treat

2,the thing interesting album s accent  seriously  beats singing layered tired clichéd  if vocals album anyone else would top  final verdict  bad music 
1,wow  kind credentials need amazon critic editor  certainly good taste music  the selection album   editor s picks top leaves grasping reality laughing i n t breathe  you ve got musically challenged  deaf  like track album  the  star ratings  sure sign apocalypse upon us

3,in critical examination  art novel   kundera meditates upon existence non existence  art  novel writing  it combination narrative philosophical ponderings highlighted kundera s famed lyricism  however  therein lies book s weakness  the dense language could lose  average  reader issues  meaning art  begin lean far towards philosophical rather analytical technique  kundera tends wander tangents

5,old rockaway  new york early photographs  exceeded expectations  i thought would provide photographic history perhaps s s  i pleasantly surprised find nineteenth century photographs peninsula true heyday  having lived arverne s s  i amazed see rich famous visited area similar way rich famous today visit hamptons east long island  as view postcards early  actually see unspoiled landscape sand dunes bay marshes longer exist  and magnificent hotels homes graced popular resort prove city new york truly mis managed development since s 
4,i would probably given book  stars belle harbor section  i grew s s  better represented  still  great see neighborhood i left teenager  for live  lived   especially spent amount time far rock  must get book to authors  issue revised edition emphasis everything west beachth street   i ll go  half stars next review

2,this album  stars songs listenable  i hardly enjoy listening album i hardly recommend album  addy 
2,this band scandinavia reminds stratovarius  they sound clean  perfect  almost forget playing rock  it s boring flat sound  female singer annoying boring voice  it s totally forgetable experience 
5,i bought album i got bands like theatre tragedy  tristania  the gathering  like someone else said  however  nightwish doom goth metal  was i dissapointed     this album masterpiece  pure metal way  power metal female opera singer  i n t think two things go together better  it wonder n t done  the songwriting good  definitely laden fantasy  the production excellent well  then amazing singer  i captivated hearing mere ten seconds  nightwish band should not overlooked 
3,wishmaster favorite nightwish albums  however  i always disappointed insanely high dynamic range compression distortion cds  so i thought try lp instead  luck ll completely different master  unfortunately  seems like apply riaa curve cd cut vinyl if re buying collector s value great  actually listen n t bother stick cd instead 
5,nightwish rules  the music spine tingling melodic powerful  everything i thought i knew about music changed forever  as long time fan savatage  prog metal bands  nightwish become favorite  i play music   i never thought i would enjoy opera voice seems meant   like never listen way  the world full tasteless crap like eminem  god please forget boybands put together mindless gatbage smacked local radio  nightwish thank wonderful barrage sound given  i still love other prog metal bands nightwish something everyone enjoys  true  music  death false ones  lol
5,nightwish works near perfection  none similar bands  lacuna coil  sinergy  stratovarius  angra    even approach  no  therion approaches  many people tend compare nightwish doom goth metal bands theatre of tragedy  tristania sins of thy beloved  please  nightwish doom goth metal  s clearly high level power metal  fast versatile guitar riffs  poignant ballads  intense female vocals  wishmaster s touching moment gentle  two for tragedy   tarja s passionate lament reaches soul listener  other highlights fast  wanderlust    crownless   the last song   fantasmic   divided three parts touching  wishmaster predecessor oceanborn without doubt essential albums metal listener  
3,well   i heard much cd  decided give listen  as power metal guitarist  tell thing stands band  tarja s vocals  music sounds like predictable yngwie or and stratovarius tune  after  s bad album  even though ll become shelf material spins  but really looking good power metal  listen sinergy  stratovarius  rhapsody even armaggedon

2,i m sure i select appreciate story develops great characters great sub plots ends abruptly  it s almost though author got bored quit  zero resolution anything  it n t leave wanting i know feeling  what hell   waiting next book 
4,i pleasantly surprised much i enjoyed book  fast paced  detailed characters  original story  epic feel make great read  i n t liked koontz  i guess kevin j anderson helped pull dean level  i look forward continuing story  especially veteran writer ed gorman 
5,book good i expect dean koontzi ve reading books long writing never disappointedi wishrd book coming sooner ll i get
5,i always fan dean koontz s books flight grounded i spend night airport  i figured i d better get book keep entertained  that s exactly book  i enjoyed reading much i almost missed connecting flight back home i n t put book down it s unique  fresh fast paced  if enjoyed original frankenstein story  adore  updated  complete modern version  you disappointed 
2,its bad book i expected  i didnt find locked waiting next thing happen unable put  one thing i didnt like chapters tiny  it doesnt really let get part story switched another  i think imply fast action keep always expecting next thing didnt work  i wont buy next book series 
5,one suggested decaulion character lacked depth  another hinted ending lacked surprise  must reading different book   remember two things  koontz wrote  s book one  we get mystery original  monster   decaulion  readers find many surprises twists story continues unfold that said  i loooooved book  this fun  intriguing look evil doc frankenstein  certainly monster chopping body become yet  dr f  impervious aging disease years  busy bee  building perfecting monsters  but things starting go terribly wrong new orleans doctor love hate read  ll love 
4,i struggled review book  as usual i picked book  dean koontz s frankenstein book  i traveling somewhere read mind flight  it worked book good  but really  could made print smaller made two books book  the book bite koontz novels  share writing  it bit far fetched  good update classic work frankenstein  overall  b jvd
5,this wonderful twist classic  the characters well rounded i grabbed beginning  i ponder biologically impossible events book could actually brewing someones lab moment  mr koontz takes today s traditional underdog makes someone pity someone perhaps admire  my negative book i hooked make sure i quickly purchase next series if like seeing dark side life let little light  undoubtedly become koontz addict i  do n t plan anything else finish one i highly recommend the face  another dark side trying usurp light  excellent  excellent  excellent books 
5,i admitt i big book reader i used  however  i saw book store i could n t resist the idea making remake classic book exciting possibly like original  let tell upfront book great     it fastest i ve ever read book   days   i could put  this book direct plot  easy follow chapter changes  koontz writes characters way truely understand exactly re feeling  sympathize even dubious villians  i hope time read book  it is worth it        ps the next part book set released july   
4,i m pleasantly suprised  i read k anderson novelizations   long time dk fan  far i really enjoyingthe series  i wont re iterate editorial write up  you canalso go dk s web page get synopsis maincharacters  looking forward next installment 
2,a decent story gets turn pages  the problem  n t enough pages  the story ends leaving middle action sequence  i n t like paying   book leaves forced buy next series  i n t mind series  thought i m much   book series stand alone 
4,the idea keep original story intact bring us new chapter years later great  the story  usual koontz book  unfolds break neck speed  i mean never lows  right last page  be forwarned  nothing even comes close closure book  its wrote entire story picked suspenceful parts book  then smiling  watch anxiously wait next volume come if like koontz  horror sifi please go get book  but word advice  may wait little closer release date second book  i m anguish knowing i wait four months 
2,the repetition information slow pace gave book feel elementary school reading material  this series could condensed book would better  i gave two stars infrequent plot twists got book rather throwing away 
1,koontz write  but sucks story teller  books supposed complete story   well ending  no  these  detectives clued fact dr frankenstein exists  creating  perfect race  day kill humans  that s  you meet original  educated  universe  frankenstein s monster  meet main characters  conflict  that s whole  story  book  really n t basic elements story beginning  middle  
2,this frankenstein series started   stars deteriorated downward every new volume  not mr koontz s standard edge seat  nail biting suspense i ve love 
4,this first dean koontz novel  highly suggested reading mother people  i really enjoyed story modern day frankenstein monster created even bigger monster  there quite stories intertwined book  presumably leading ending which brings i give book  stars  while well written edited  left huge cliffhanger  i understand part series i personally prefer book somewhat wrapped going onto next  this book suddenly ended middle scene  anyway  i ll getting rest books  course    i know good quality writing i see 
4,this great read  the mad scientist return  theres much mystery intriguing  however  i find bit confusing many charecters keep order understand whole storey  meshes frankenstien im glad i read  
3,not usual koonz intrigue  i see would made great tv series  rather predictable   supernatural   i ll buy series anyway  koonz entertains leaves book begging s  heros  
3,i ve wanted start series year  anticipation could led disappointment while ending book pretty good  took long time get  there lot characters introduced i spent book trying figure  it became apparent towards  journey little disappointing  i wanted deucalion vivid character  barely book  i feeling next book series may little exciting i m going give read  i hope ve enough back ground information given prodigal son city night page turner i m hoping 
4,i m much dean koontz fan  tendency use deus ex machina  resolve plots always put  i m much fan horror genre anyway  i rarely read koontz  however i heard bunch series  including rumor martin scorsese time expressed interest producing tv  anyway  i really kind glad read see koontz put little life novel twist old story  i m actually looking forward next two parts 
5,i loved dean koontz years books late gotten away reason i fell love stories   all i say he s back  i n t waitnd book   i could put  made breathless whole way 
3,i enjoyed story uneven parts n t contribute story felt thrown  in addition  i often glad i reading story kindle i needed look several unfamiliar words words far outside common use even kindle dictionary 
3,this good story interesting twist plot but   cliffhanger ending indeed i like books ending i like   read next book series find happens characters current story so start series hand  books rachell youngman
4,i d read first three odd thomas books koontz s  thought i d try frankenstein  review amazon said rehash old  and  n t  it s refreshing twist resurfacing madman  never destroyed  actually resents shelley woman s story   clean dash aldous huxley s brave new world  pinch james lee burke s detective angle  flavor hi test horror  i m starting vol  tonight 
5,well actually   of course  nothing top original  but koontz comes classic scythe ready cause change faith fans original  this much remake supplement classic  koontz references story simply fast forwards time  keeping original victor monster  giving longevity the prose ellegant speed neck breaking  it appears mr koontz uses big  words paints detailed scenarios may intimidate readers  i challenge read work loud  ll see nicely words roll tongue 
5,i ve always liked dean koontz  this however different others  it still fast read  i found hard put  i already ordered second started  this saga i n t 
3,a pretty decent story  however  book marketed  opinion  retelling classic new  spin  things  this case  in actuality  continuation classic  pulling dr frankenstein monster present day 
1,definition bad book  book n t make get next chapter  i kept trying see would eventually grab  maybe chapters plodding prose  i gave  thank goodness library book 
4,book dean koontz s frankenstein solid  entertaining read  i n t know taken conpliment criticism koontz gorman  i really could n t tell parts written koontz gorman  whether gorman wrote whole thing  style koontz  anyway  s koontz s original forceful storytelling  passes page turning test  it kept hooked  wanting read continuation second book koontz s frankenstein lays  heightened extent  many faults virtues koontz s writing general  the novel extremely readable  suffers patness character plotting  it s good book  great one still  good book s good book 
2,i love dean koontz  this favorite  in fact i rather unhappy whole book  now n t get wrong great writer book bored  i n t read get bored 
5,this gift christmas  i m sure enjoy  had hard time finding books  thanks

1,about four weeks ago  i purchased home depot florida plasplugs  master tiler   model number  dww180us bx i using porcelain installation  the original blade worked ok initial cuts  i need replace proper blade type  i bought porcelain replacement blade blade mfr i bought saw  when i got around replacing blade  i found plasplugs machine uses different  arbor  everybody else  the replacement blade worthless me i called plasplugs us office order  high glaze  blade  much chagrin  i told  blades except standard discontinued   i bought saw four weeks ago  i think irresponsible manufacturer behave matter you assured i avoid plasplug product future 
3,not bad small saw  hp motor cut nicely  the side saw water guard blade blocks view cut  i modify mount water guard would n t catch back  if cut degrees forgetaboutit   the tool comes rip fence miter gauge   although miter gauge slot   i make jig cut degrees   on positve side water tank pretty self contained water guard kept mess minimum   i ve rented bigger saws larger jobs ended cleaning muddy water walls  this unit lasted day fill spills side onto floor 
4,for cost  saw expectations  following setup instructions aligning fence  saw performed well cutting  while difficult freehand beveled cuts using tilting table  worked well i used spring clamps attach guide strip back side followed edge tilting table  the water reservoir provided good source water blade  i found i replenish supply water regular basis  i bought saw able diagonally cut   tiles would fit sliding table saw  the quality saw definately much higher less costly plastic versions  having used tool  i would buy i needed saw 
1,i recommend tool  when i first used  i could n t cut  i noticed blade spinning backwards  when i turned saw   blade n t spin  finally  i realized i  spin  blade manually i switched saw get turn correctly  not i expected       tool  once i finally got working  i still disappointed performance  cutting slow  accurate   
2,you could lot better price tool  comparing comprable models costing half much  i recommend spending cheaper models springing something better  the blade would n t align blade guard i modified table file  the tightening bolt runs fence stripped less two weeks light use   trust  i m that strong   spend less spend  n t bother spend tool  one additional note  i contacted manufacturer stripped rip fence promptly sent replacement without questions  i suppose s worth upgrade   stars  i still think could better money  oh  saw leaks water continuously unit operating  better leave two stars afterall 
5,used saw cut   inch granit worked better anticipated  had leaks others indicated some mess  yes  unusual cutting  the diamond blade lasted throughout kitchen project show signs wear towards   certainly great value   
3,let start saying saw payed many times  i two bathrooms  walls floor   hallway   backsplashes  laundry room floor tile the motor definitely powerful enough job  i cut stone  ceramic  porcelain saw without problems the construction bit flimsy  the table tilting mechanism worthless  the worst thing saw     arbor  the aftermarket blades     arbor hole masonry blades n t used  you re stuck buying blades plasplugs n t make high glaze blade delicate glazed chipping glaze around cut line if re pro  get good professional saw  need several rooms house  saw adequate 
1,this good concept  poorly executed  on particular saw  tilt section table n t fit flush  made right side table useless  once raised degree position  tilt section wobbly  flimsy plastic props even touch rest  the blade ran neither true parallel fence  the blade retaining nut tightened every cuts  the blade actually flew shaft couple times  the caught plastic caps fence  stick  i could easily stall motor ordinary  inch ceramic  ca n t remember thigs wrong  i much hurry return 
1,the first i cut   i knew i purchased wrong saw  maybe use rip fence would work ok  cut freehand  useless  the blade comes table  like table saw  blade spinning inch water bottom tank  the blade picks water sprays inside clear guard blade  this makes impossible see lines marked  it impossible make accurate cut n t see cut lines  using saw without guard option  unless working outside  n t mind getting drenched  bad design  i m returning spending extra money get something good 
1,bought home depot   it toy  suitable serious work  flimsy contruction  difficult impossible adjust  recommend getting brand 
1,my main complaint fence  getting sides square blade locked five minute s even n t put much pressure fence ether bow side move  an mk much faster put carriage push blade make sure kurf going correct side mark slide carriage back set fence  d like  turn saw cut  i renovate older home many times walls square cut tiles going getting bigger smaller go god help get position plasplugs saw   
2,the rail keeps popping  plastic endcaps longer flush table  i file n t get caught  the tilting table move apart hinge i start pushing blade  useless  straight cuts seemed work ok  this may suitable small around house jobs  i think design england  bad british engineering  
4,so far i complaints  it seems working  i think time  i know i absolutely love  i low progesterone suffer pmdd  my last cycle  pms symptoms less pronounced  i think working 
1,made really dizzy i stop using use  i ended tossing 
4,i taking supplement  i day  i tried taking week minimize pills i every day  i could feel mood worsen  this great product 
1,i found research said possibly may help get cycles back finishing bottle cycle never came  i guess keep months might help  i decided instead buying hoping would help talk doctor first 
2,i noticed i tired headachy taking vitex  i read common side effect temporary  after first week  i noticed tiredness increasing  i would feel almost confused times plain strange  when taking day  time  i completely drove past shopping center i going  i d go spells i felt heady  like i going pass  i takingmg day  i high hopes treatment pcos  i could n t continue  this n t seem like common result  malaise confusion listed among vitex s side effects  maybe i tried vitex fruit less potent vitex extract  something i m messing around  back progesterone cream 
4,jay hoggard vibes player shows strong affinity milt jackson bobby hutcherson  his use pedal gives warm  dream like sound  unaccompanied version my one and only love good example  but swing hard   starting over  bobby hutcherson tune features drummer yoron israel  sweet potato right church  group plays relaxed stompin  at the savoy  guitarist kenny burrell plays well monk s epistrophy  the misstep title track  much  freer  others strong ornette coleman flavor  other  s excellent cd 
5,i bought extra strength  i bought regular realize came extra strength  i alternate using seem work  this product taken away  redness flaking due rosacea  i really tried everything nothing worked past  even skin dr suggested things nothing worked  i saw show nbc thought i would give try glad i  i use everyday  i unsure price much lower amazon vs buying directly dr gross website  seems odd 
3,for amount time invested money spent  product live expectations  i re order  i noticed little change skin even tho i used faithfully according directions 
3,this product okay  but  i n t find big difference i added skin procedures  secondly  little pads thin  kind low budget  product
1,i hoping acid convenient use  well  pretty convenient  swipe  but nothing  i wanted try get rid little bumps clogging pores frequent breakouts  however  skin remained  and n t really scent  seems chemicals wafting pads affected sinuses i quite sensitive nose  i switched using back got result  nothing  so expensive experiment n t work  it may work someone else nothing  most disappointing  i since switched salicylic gel peel  hurts whole lot  gets job done 
5,this skincare product saved year old complexion  it s like facial every day  great anybody  skintype  even teenagers  worth money  leaves skin w   right  texture  dry  greasy  you apply make up right using pads 
3,i used buy ddf s days radiance  s similar concept pads  different applications  somehow discontinued  i went nordstrom makeup counter recommended trying md skincare line  maybe particular product works little slower ddf i patient see great results  but far using week s so so  i wish ddf would bring back re product s amazing  not sure worth spending   
1,this horrible product  if waste  product ruin skin  look  if breakout horribly even n t normally awful rash days  product  if deal company n t anything except making quick buck  buy md skincare 
3,i using product three months  at first  really seemed making skin tone clear radiant  but main problem oily skin adult acne  worse   and md n t helped  my skin still oil slick  i still get frequent breakouts  dealing breakouts started really tick i spending around  month md skincare system  versus  i used spend neutrogena like  but give md credit  i cruddy skin  large pores  oily  etc  i like clean feeling pads give n t seem worth cost anymore  so i moving  going try nucelle 
5,great product  i used many skin product far best  but expensive buy sparingly   im high roller  i ordered product twice last year works right away  the problem really use days pads dry  this dissapointing since really dont need use everyday  nonetheless product works   money would keep ready supply cabinet

3,i feel bad mariah  stands chance going best diva ever  whitney houston whitney beautiful  ridiculously talented  perfect voice mariah ugly  check huge forehead   overrated singer world this excellent song mariah completely ruins 
2,the movie version song much better  the mariah whitney version simply screaming contest see sing better  i admit song beautiful touching  would better sung instead competition  buy soundtrack listen movie version  it showcases song much better light 
2,the song sung beautifully  promoting new age  should believe god  i think focus believing god 
5,this song  sung whitney houston mariah carey great  sometimes  leaves tears eyes  but  song contrasts  whitney houston beautiful voices universe  so sings first verse chorus  mariah carey starts sing second verse   s huge contrast  mariah screeches   if celine dion  wonderfully beautiful voice universe  sung whitney houston  song would ve irresistible  it would unexplainable beautiful  anyway  great job  mariah whitney

5,finally  somebody written truly useful book important american science fiction authors  robert a heinlein  in past  sloppy criticism grinding personal axes ruined every single attempt produce book discussing heinlein s works  i misfortune read   gifford produced groundwork future studies heinlein  basic categorization numbering every single published unpublished work canon  along insiders  story entry  readable cover cover  reference work  gifford performed invaluable goal every reader s companion  s sent back rereading original works  fresh perspectives insights  a perfect score  twenty years utter failures heinlein scholarship  bravo 
5,james gifford given us book immense scope  detailing works science fiction s grand master  genre s prolific authors the format reader friendly  the individual entries work fascinating heinlein lover  bibliography opus list prove invaluable new readers wish delve heinlein s universe  truly landmark achievement research clarity 
3,somewhat disappointing heinlein fan interested detailed summaries analysis  more useful looking chronologies  timelines  cross referencing  etc  still  flawed heinlein reader s companion better nothing 
4,it since i read book  maybe two months   i wanted add body reviews love latin american fiction books might read like old masterpiece theater productions  ll probably enjoy reading book  otherwise ll probably bored tears  the writing sophisticated  covered others  actually  given quality book  i m surprised number reviewers  many better books even latin american fiction like belli s the invisible woman far less coverage  however  thinking buying book well read genre  something specifically el salvador   n t wrong 
3,i much looking forward reading book since came highly recommended trusted book catalogue  on positive side  book gives interesting account historical struggle rich coffee plantation owners uprising poor indian workers  however  author fails  opinion  developing characters beyond superficial  thus i remained uninvolved part detached human tragedies  in summary  ms benitez wonderful premise story  history description el salvador enlightening part beautiful  plot characters ultimately remain shallow mimick sub plot soap opera 
2,this book group selection month i looking forward good read  especially judging appealing cover  ms benita indeed great story teller visual discriptions  however  character developmentis sorely lacking  perhaps point   all sorts trying events  happy occassions significant life experiences occur little impact i really know many chacacters  although i wanted  jacinta particular needed enchancement  it interesting hear fellow book club members think 
1,i amazed high ratings book received  it  undoubtedly  worst book i ever read  it might better good editing  there many unimportant characters many horrible descriptions could omitted  who really cares dogs  many relevance story  who really cares detailed description decor room  yes  i finish book  way  ending  toward middle book i actually started editing  what mess 
4,this first book i read sandra benitez  i done much research matanza el salvador civil  i salvadoran began reading book critically historical point view  it began quite slow somewhat sided  i read i began feel i knew characters realities  this excellent book  the realities life  love  family  death  presented strongly passionately  the ending gripping seems unlikely  definately portrays difficult times civil  read  provide fictional story lives torn country 
2,this trials tribulations multigenerational family we found disengaging rather tedious  it went without getting far beginning started skipping scenes see picked  in abandoned it i d hoped movie saif ali khan  salman khan  karisma kapoor i guess n t among better stuff  the music dance ho hum unmemorable too elsewhere net scores average  however average us keeper 
5,these best goggles ever tried  they fit well  fog good seal  no rashes material  the instructions replacing clear lenses optic lenses rubbish pop plastic frame  rest easy  ignore packet instructions follow instincts

1,i got book expecting bunch puzzles cover title  there many items found  everything looks out dated  definitely keep looking puzzles up to date patterns wayne
2,i love esv translation rate five stars  i upset publisher translation poorly packages product  this edition  shirt pocket  edition seems well bound impossibly small print what needed  coat pocket  size edition new testament bound way lie open accord  the print size higher  this present edition lie open    print small ant could read it crossway publishes two editions new testament alone  inferior  the print small read enjoyment  something change 
2,my review centers thing  type size  this edition disappointingly  humble opinion  unnecessarily small  increasing type size point two would move edition unreadable readable   increase book length hundred pages  since currently almost pages  i feel quite certain binding could accommodate another pages problem what makes frustrating type nice clean would n t require magnifying glass little larger i really n t believe our lord meant us suffer eye strain read his word  i think he wants us carry around large books small books readable type would serve  his  purpose 
1,really  really awful  the sheer paucity alan dean foster s imagination staggering   midworld  recommended friend  first i thought i victim bad joke  could used blueprint write novel  witless  humorless  lacking even slightest glimmer originality  do n t waste time 
5,no describes creature like alan dean foster  hands  best  his silverslith sent shivers arms  i ve read many times  i even use teach students write descriptive paragraph  his mind knows bounds inventing animals  plants  humans  probably favorite fantasy book times  though mid flinx  comes close second 
5,this book  like heinlein s starship troopers  book i keep reading years  similar reasons  as previous reviewers stated  book quite compact  yet rich complete  operates several levels  it s description fascinating world  it s adventure story  it s character study  it s parable  the concept intriguing  characters multi faceted  it s compact classic  today i n t realized midworld shown books  those books   going amazon wish list today read book  read starship troopers  both so much bugs in space  they re worth far time actually read 
5,i first read book teenager  many  many years ago  i still bookshelf every year re immerse foster s wildly imaginative world  he great talent inventing intriguing flora fauna  only two little flaws mind  midworld seems little lethal colony survive long enough discover home trees make use them   in mid flinx  author describes fire extinguishing flora  they apparently n t exist midworld  corporation could n t built r  d  complex 
4,beautifully written prose form  baldwin writes race relations  awakening s mind differences  perceived otherwise  race  color  political ramifications  very candid  yet ultimately subtle    the book  written form letter  makes think trials many minorities  primarily african americans  go went far ve today      yet sadly  much go  this short book makes think   with eyes wide open 
3,i enjoyed reading tales others romantic  although i bit disappointed lack creativity originality vignettes  if wanting help romantic  skip book  if looking feel good experience  reading happy couples  might enjoy 
5,i d agree m speedy  album great  if enjoy cyndi boste second album n t disappoint 
4,jokes funny cutting  often seems women victims comedy often  but jokes aside  book quotations demonstrates even numbers equal  target commentary amusing attacking centuries  the illustrations simple black  white drawings  victorian  style  rather satirically considering gender roles time  the book organized premise males extincted species pseudo historical view survivors  females  the book five chapters quotations organized subject tone  i found actually quite interesting necessarily funny  i m historian feminist i over analyzing content  i m sure  i find good source bitting commentary i write fiction

5,i love story tess  considering many classics i ever read  i think tess easier ones understand  the work masterful story  however  i issue penguin s version  the notes awful referencing back forth place book back nightmare many times n t worth breaking flow  some notes helpful even necessary understand sentence  others pointless annoying  i recommend different version  either without notes entirely reasonable ones 
4,this novel  contrary comments  wonderful piece literature  although uplifting  great example hardy deterministic naturalistic fiction  despite tess  best efforts  like jude hardy novel   unable escape poverty misfourtune attempts leave behind  although somewhat lengthy  novel better pieces british fiction period 
5,i n t believe tragic book  i picked book unexpected decision  the book i supposed read queen damned  i saw book cover appealed  so i decided i ll read  at first kinda boring  last  book  i depressed   fate toying  characteristic decided fate         anywayz  truly wonderful book  either plot  writing  background  history  religion  describtion  etc etc  s perfection  read  even though beginning part might kinda boring  s understand better i d recommend book anybody  like tragedies  definitely have read

2,the back cover book described tess heroine time  i thrilled begin reading book discover made heroine  i disappointed book  she heroine  like self pitying brat  hardy fantastic job describing life periold time  talent enough change opinion book  very aggrevating   
2,tess boring works literature  yes  hardy rather revolutionary period far choice heroine subjects dealt  n t necessarily add good book  the story n t bad   re willing wade unnecessary muck piece together  however  i trouble stomaching fact tess lauded brave virtuous heroine actually completely spineless times rather annoying  i n t spoil story giving examples  since may well intending read anyway  forced read class  if latter   good luck 
3,it seemed tess d urbervilles bit dull times  storyline whole quite interesting  there great deal imagery  much i deemed way actually getting absorbed novel  surprises abound  surrounded lengthy passages describing everything anything  nature  important aspect novel  receives much attention  hardy expounds upon meticulously  becomes effort read everything  i disappointed beginning style narration  actually  thinking hardy s novels  much like    i found absorbing  the character tess memorable  awe inspiring  i recommend plenty time devote novel  looking quick read   like hardy s style   ll find good read

2,this part attempt read classics non fiction well usual speculative fiction year  a people noted hardy bit hard read  turned true  his style jagged choppy  bouncing around quite bit  never giving true glimpse scenes important know interpret  question tess  seduction rape alec d urberville   however  overall  interesting story least i enjoyed book  but considering ending seemed rather ill fitting rest  i ll pass giving high rating  it rather disappointing slog odd phrasings quirks  let characters magically changing personality traits  i think tess weakling without mind part  angel worthless  character potential story so called villain  alec d urberville 
2,i n t like book much  it silly  i m sorry i ve wasted time reading book  there better books read 
3,this book anything special  although i love romances  simple  the symbolism spelled readers blunt manner  the less educated readers may appreciate  the wording quite beautiful times plot enchanting  perfect movie  heart wrenching like movie titantic  must see

1,i really disappointed book surprised many people think wonderful story  it depressing story reflects worst things way women treated time  i n t think story redeeming qualities likeable characters  even tess quite irritating times pride getting way asking help make life little easier  
5,for beginning read classics great hook  while characters complex story linear allusions simple enough follow  one n t help hope tess s life somehow turn right although knowing  the burdens encounters seem little stop moving forward  life seems unfair  hardy handles masterfully  indeed safe say hardy loves god 
3,this classic novel saddest  it involves likeable  innocent country girl seduced cruel employer  she child union early infancy  she later meets loves upon learning past rejects  she meets first  forces mistress  the ending sad through tess maintains dignity likeable character  this novel shows extreme cruelty legalistic morality tempered compassion respect others  particularly women time period the book well written like poetic descriptions vivid imagery  hardy master  human drama 
5,not frustration negative sense  fact  book i could hardly put  the fact i felt compelled express thoughts perhaps point s even greater impact  a fabulous story  course  tragic   and i feel frustrated  perhaps merely fact tess  rash action  almost self defence  closes tragic life  and need story extend beyond final close see defence succeed life prevail  however  modern times  chasm seems wide  tess beautiful person  innocent intention good  suffers result  while ground breaking novel  s eloquence true life appeal allows become part  i highly recommed book read

1,my star rating due fact oxford university press gives away plot twists even shocker ending second paragraph introduction  most fun reading novel trying find happen next  oxford spoils giving away start  thinking       if pick edition  skip intro  read after book  otherwise  hardy s novel great story insight noble character  hardy gets  stars  oxford u press gets 
2,story original  using common character instead nobility   story keeps drugging forever something  it novel  prose   i wonder author waste bunch pages expressing emotions heroin  and i think tess terribly idiodic  why continue love unforgiving cruel husband  is n t degradation female saying always loyal matter desert  so  even try read book time 
1,  hate  my revenge forced read tess kid write negative review adult  so  s done

1,this book many written  bubble era    gaijin   primarily americans  really knew next nothing japan  yet somehow found publisher  usually japanese  another quickie genre published time book teaching profanity japanese studying english   learning bow  may accurate account author s experience living japan teaching jet program  however  s  it s full cliches  sweeping generalizations  offers insight living japan understanding culture  what could writer possibly know two years 
4,this book good  having lived japan year half  i knew realities school life  this book de mythologizes educational system shows impressive strengths  fatal flaws  i thought balanced approach  it would great read whenever feel american educational system left dust  it raise spirits 
1,i may good reviewer i stopped reading page i believe good book read learn japanese culture  as japanese born raised japan i find book extremely humiliating 
5,i remember i left first trip japan  reading feiler adventures onsen hot springs  i remember description clothes bathe front japanese guys  any yet  trip thing happened  i felt like feiler  the book informative japanese culture time great read  its must read plan visit japan   especially teacher

1,i disappointed book  i lived japan  years  still   married taught jet programme  as former jet i disheartened book paint accurate picture life japan jet  granted people s experiences differ prefecture prefecture school school  learning bow s anecdotes observations japan far extreme times border lies  also frequent use sarcasm satire anyway humorous portrays author  god s gift english teaching   for anyone curious life jet programme  teaching english japan life japan general  i recommend book 
3,like many people japan book recommended i n t read  a friend gave copy eventually i read it the author gets many things wrong japan i wonder really spoke much japanese suggests  i often found self scoffing opinions explanations  it seems japanese experience gone write books topics he strikes quite loner  summary social interaction must lonely time  jet programme uncommon however good writing style makes lot failures  i d suggest reading enjoying perspective wary explanations 
3,this book well written flows well  however  events book way described  black white  tastes  a good read  considering teaching living japan  book grain salt 
5,when i heard making file the unbearable lightness being  i thought   good luck    the main gist book philosophical  hard quality translate film  but kaufman  help daniel day lewis  manages improve upon book  adding color  humor  profound sense intimacy  a touching beautifully done love story

3,of course  reason others n t tell stories may stories patently false  i looking book would good read  collapse    something would tell fallen civilizations  this n t book  least rigorous  scientific approach  the author  example  asserts pterodactyls live today s arizona the author believes traditional academics dismissing truth n t fit preconceived notions  the reason i n t rate book lower clearly great source others feel way  the rest us  however  need look elsewhere scientifically grounded speculation north american prehistory 
1,i bought book thinking i would learn something least given food thought  what i got bad travelogue full inane information restaurants author ate  people  wore  there nothing serious even amateur scholar  just junk 
5,as californian  frequenter sierra nevadas  well college student obsesses fine american literature  i found work perhaps well written piece beat fiction ve read  contrary popular belief  i feel much mature insightful piece  on road   anything brilliance kerouac s breakthrough work  held reverence literature philosophy enthusiasts across globe  japhy ryder s buddha representation  well kerouac s struggle incorporate new discovery traditional buddhism original catholic upbringing representative western frontier eastern thought  becoming popular even today  thanks likes jack kerouac  bravo 
4,although n t greatest book written kerouac  easily favorite written  there many weak moments contradictions characters  kerouac  passion pages hard deny  he really means everything writes believes trying become better person  all told  fun  romantic trip  something lacking today s cynicism 
4,anyone respect nature  dharma  life  philosophy gain book  kerouac always way drawing reader putting place  it s beautiful eye opening book 
3,jack kerouac came recommended several presumably legitimate sources however  reading dharma bums may think twice next time people offer others  avid hiker relate sections book dealing senarios book whole seemed drag  scenes much potential captivating friend s girlfriend committs suicide  kerouac fails really emphasize  overall rate book  stars subject genre book read much better authors  impressed 
2,i ve read  on the road  three times last six years  it  opinion  masterpiece  having said i decided get  dharma bums  i book i buddha zen  only glimmer fun  on the road  seeped  enough i like supporting characters i  on the road   this book pushed many people kerouac s second best  i found uninteresting probably pursue books considered  second best   
3,the plot ray smith thirty something  i presume   unemployed  hippie road hopping trains find inner buddha  eventually  winds california meets japhy ryder imitates t  letting know full well ray smith mind  they meet buddhists  drink wine  talk buddhist stuff like diamond sutra  bhoddisatvas bhikkhus  past buddhas  write lot haiku poems  all  narrator constantly bombarding reader strange buddhist revelations comes praying like  everything empty awake     rocks space space illusion   it gets old fast ray smith reminds less cool dude  the big lebowski   you n t find fascinating stories sal paradise   on road   meeting new people wherever went  jazz clubs drinking much  drugs  sexual encounters women entertained   nothing 
3,if interested beat literature  american lit s american experience general  means read book  you ll learn little entertained talented  exciting writer  if re interested buddhism  please read something authentic buddhist teacher  i e  dalai lama  thich nhat hanh  etc   jack kerouac s life lifestyle presented book little connection practice buddhism 
5,liked on road  has completely different feel  one favorite reads 
3,a somewhat sad story   the protagonist  dis spirited  wistful  melancholy soul  s  haddit  middleclass  american society  n t   constant refills huge  bottomless wine goblet  hits highroad  full zen  buddha  etc   i waiting guys liver simply explode body   reminded bit  catcher rye   odd    into wild     easy rider   odd way  hongo s  volcano    this theme restlessness  discontent   self   dissatisfaction   and never quite finding home  never  even aid horrific amounts booze  quite settling in  i wonder kerouac s state being  minus alcohol   sad  triumphant  story 
5,cracker jack s got quite nack righting shindigs bums rucksacks  dharma bums gives glimpse life beats focus cut zen  this really great story inspire  on side note i recommend trying find original edition  old pages really smell lot better 
3,this incoherent book self absorbed author voice beat  ironically  attempting self beatnik ultimately implodes isolation  how ego driven ignore reality embracing  you separate spritual thin ice kerouc lives novels 
2,ok let s talk like ordinary people  if someone buy new tv unless  tv modern book  if ve read  on the road   maybe ll read something diferent  this book  drama  wasted money  can book change life   yes  stone high speed could less time  ally mcbeal backstreet boys song message book 
2,i tried give kerouac chance revive reading notable mess on road   now i m thoroughly confused s popular 
2,maybe i enlightened  i n t think book great  kerouac often completely incoherent  much said nonsense  further i n t understand everyone wants dharma bum  nothing leaches living others earn  it decent read  especially mountain climbing scene  great make  definitely life changing 
2,one might expect interesting  down to earth account poet s buddhist discoveries spiritual growth  n t done right  characters one dimensional  contrived  act like buddhist wanna bes   is person real buddhist proud buddhism   what powerful introspective journey kerouac  reader  i tell s  kerouac n t get way across  i found rolling eyes  still trying give benefit doubt if first kerouac read   choose something else may forever turn kerouac  could otherwise fabulous story teller if  let know 
1,i found dharma bums suprising  i thought on road rambling  self indulgent books i ve ever read  i realized dharma bums even  the book reminded degeneration american intellectual life began beats  least s  self rightous shallow  mention drunk womanizers  odd trait devout buddhists  this book cultural artifact beat  book add s must read list  life short  read better 
2,ok  i know beat classic  written jack kerouac patron saint beat literature  but i got say novel pretty damn boring dhama bums another semi fictional novel based real events occurred kerouac s life events described on road  it s kerouac s search simple life zen buddhism  the premise sounds interesting enough  n t anything offer i described kerouac s classic on the road like episode seinfeld  show nothing  despite rather complimentary comparison i thought novel good i highly recommended it dharma bums another meandering novel nothing really happens  i guess meandering trip enough  as far learning anything buddhism novel  guess would learn real buddhist like dalai lama wannabee like kerouac 
2,not much dharma going  but lots bum  in fact  i m totally bummed finishing novel i feel uncool enamoured bible beat generation i   n t  get   so much rambling  excruciatingly long sentences perfunctorily reporting things happen style then said i picked went outside     insert yawn   there glimpses good authorship parts novel part unbelievably boring monotonic narrator s voice re discovering speed reading skills finish thing  disappointing i love good story i love eastern philosophy neither  unless re impressionable teenager thinks bumming around cool everything friends think cool  anything indie cool  forget 
3,ca n t say really grabs like on the road  i feel less like action comings goings people mentioned novel  admittedly may fact i actually read on the road i purchased audio book i read part the dharma bums  getting audio book  the person narrates audio book seems bored listless 
4,stylistically idealogically kerouac  the idea living truly free life without boundaries truely provoked lot thought personally  it makes ray japhy s friends  go find shack live really exist may best way exist  free material incarceration  i recommend book read young adults everywhere  not opened new way thought really matters world could possibly change life better wrapped around society s focus material possession symbols achievement 
5,this book lured world kerouac  i previously read  on road   excellent  i feel match  dharma bums   this book changed life  it changed way thought  kerouac introduces reader experiences beliefs novels  mostly semi autobiographical  before novel consumed  notion buddhism  in retrospect single influential thing i exposed  this book starting point kerouac fan  i recommend follow book kerouac s  desolation angels   simple  yet satisfying literature  i really encountered writers beloved  beautiful poetic simple jazz talk random amusing european literary dropping  pick  maybe change life 
5,yes   on the road  gets attention  follow up work far gorgeous uplifting   sleeping beach climbing mountain  flowering buddhist consciousness  jack really takes reader  filled plenty movement  bohemian idealism ginsberg snyder  self discovery  joy  etc  simply jack shows fully alive love magic experience   dharma bums  soars high  big sur  dives depths agony  read book  will feel beauty life without anchors 
3,dharma bums on the road realized  as karouac s books  d b  longing search  it actualy little zen represents thought common souls  beautiful nievity un understood wisdom  for anyone path couriosity truth  for zen try looking robert pirsig 
2,at first printer worked well  year nothing trouble to begin  n t print   pages  page grabber  start grab sheet paper time  text ends going across them then printer driver   manual two sided printing classic mac os years  in short  last hp printer  the jamming paper feed much handle 
1,there s question importance hodge s book  but   kindle edition simply scanned ocr almost worthless  it would far easier read simple image form 
2,my negative comments nothing content hodge wrote  excellent  but quality kindle edition poor  the ocr scan resulted unintelligible words almost every paragraph  lack links table contents severely limits usefulness reference source  it s completely useless  general i find i m looking make sense text  so cents i suppose i m getting money s worth  but edition better quality would welcome 
3,the kindle version available horrible ocr failure epic proportions  the text badly garbled  great deal work needed read  the actual book  however  brilliant  highly recommended 
1,this kindle version worth money  even cheap  it poor uncorrected ocr scan  it unreadable unusable  find cleaner edition  this rip off 
5,five definetly world s greatest boy band  even though split  still awesome   let s dance  poppy song  definetly makes dance title suggests  the extra track  sometimes  awesome remix pretty good  the megamix rules overall  let s dance  good single buy i recommend people like dance music  pop music anything catchy  also  re huge five fan  must buy  a definete  star 
4,movie amazing hd story awesome battles intense nonstop thrill movie  minor thing thats bad megan foxx wasent say fan  special features dosent matter long well made bluray defently recommend movie go buy asap enjoy
2,the usual action scenes  ridiculous plot holes  the vast majority plot points made sense whatsoever  i think michael bay trying make worst possible movie still makes millions dollars 
2,mediocre best story line bad  dry predictable action scenes drew interest  used liners previous movies 
2,i wish i n t spent money   it follows style two transformers movies  turns formula bit  there s action bickering characters  plot  story character development  drama  semblance intelligence sacrificed it yes  special effects cool  dialog interaction characters downright painful  kept suspension disbelief kicking in if i  i d rent 
3,i bought keep collection transformer movies intact  i found setup plot little slow going  i rate third series rated  the fantasy little fantastical  the action quite snuff  the new girlfriend eye candy side  mystique missing  the returning characters part upholding imagination film  i see theater  thank goodness  it worth watching ages

3,although i n t purchase movie amazon  i thought i d enjoy blu ray combo pack  the movie fun  better opinion i would thought  the action fast cg long way short time first third movies my complaint although  get combo pack dvd digital copy  get extra features  if i known  i d waited purchase later date  i thought insulting include coupond copy movie package itself will i purchase next version extras  no buyers n t extra features happy version  the transfer blu ray good  surround sound works great home theater system the story really excuse action  do n t think little plot  it s fun popcorn movie missing vital information interested background information 
1,this good movie  just stay away version  i excited bought release day find feature film  i really disappointed  i would never purchased movie i known feature  yes  i know  excitement get movie  fault looking carefully back box  although  nowhere could i find says feature film  i used download movies illegally  i stopped started buying legit special features really enjoyable  when companies charge full price feature  get netflix anyway   i feel cheated  maybe everyone start downloading illegally really send hollywood whoever message hard earned money need work little harder  this rant 
2, sorry   this is for blu ray  not amazon instant video  would given  stars movie blu ray  i disappointed special features  even notes  that s main reason i like dvds blu rays much   special features may contain commentary  interviews  behind scenes show fx done  explosions  i m sure release another version near future special features movie buffs enjoy spend cash  who hell comes new release blu ray day  age zero special features    do not buy  rent from red box 
1,dont give money filmakers later road release better version movie if extra features version will not disc   wait deluxe version 
1,ok i heard better last transformers  n t see   i thought must ok  it s got worst movies i ve ever seen  horrible acting  sure shia labeouf actor   think matthew mcconaughey ben affleck  without charisma  if cartoons  explosions superficial story telling might palatable   otherwise d better watching grass grow 
1,crack think movie worth dollarsd  this another scam like cell companies internet providers charging data like limited amount isnt self imposed  the technology overwhelming rd cost  times dvd twice blu ray dont get wrong loved bestd movies i seen honestly dollars taking advantage consumers market else go  if disk bucks id hesitantly thats problem blu ray charge way much theatre experience  sad cause movie captain america ones would bought refuse let think good going price gimmick 
5,i n t understand people n t like revenge fallen  i thought great  i thought first transformers best   until i saw dark moon  dark moon perfect movie  it comedy  suspense   most importantly  action  some action sequences great  and white knuckling sequences have prepared  and shia laboef great new actress  she better megan fox  in way know i mean   but altogether  a book  so dissapointed s final  michael bay  masterpiece 
1,got word movie blows worst movies seen long time first part movie put wife sleep  body reads even time money movie
1,this film like teenager short attention span  storytelling like facebooking too many plots cover  horrible pacing  depth 
2,i guess done research bought  i enjoy transformers franchise even though feel likendrd movie never live qualityst i enjoyed enough decide buy bluray dvd hoping blu ray format additional special features would keep entertained  well put movie treated  movie  different audio languages  nothing commentary  behind scenes  deleted scenes  etc     if nothing movie buy itunes something  i d recommend getting special edition version learned i already bought
2,let s start film  i would say transformers film rivals first quality  it s really good  i would give solid four five  this first film i seen imax  d returning states stationed overseas  i completely blown away  d effects sound  however  i feel i duped paramount i opened blu ray combo pack  dollar coupon transformers  dark moon  d  blu ray dvd digital copy  i know studio trying squeeze every dollar us   they probably  d version ready wanted milk us  i would recommend buying version waiting newer scheduled release soon so summarize  filmshady blu ray release business practices  negative i could 
4,this great third movie series  not happy dropping meagan fox series  however movie gave general population wanted   giant robots fighting  there perfect mix disappointment  sadness  joy movie  there lot parts left stunned   good way  disappointed way throw f bomb movie  great movie  lots fighting  acceptable conclusion series  
4,i love three transformers movies  last favorite  whatever reason megan fox dark moon  loss continuity new female lead  there chemistry megan shia labeouf rosie huntington whiteley n t bring screen  imo i appreciate irony government getting outwitted transformers  what would happen  s transformers iv  actually get cooperation outset instead stumbling  bumbling upper echelon idiot get way  i know s script  gives good drama   s story line over in  however  s  spoiler alert  good guys  triumph evil  requisite stunts  explosions stomach churning  death defying drama makes movie almost good first two  definitely worth  thanks  always  amazon availability prepurchase  
3, s  long  drawn  fun  main redeeming part good actors happened  way gives value movie  watch robots fight  movie 
2,i really liked first  second okay  but dark moon difficult  endless dialogue minimal action sequences  i found looking time far often  they dropped meghan fox  despite controversial reputation  definitely added cast  the special effects still amazing  n t enough action  boring    if going continue franchise better turn notches 
5,excellent sequel follow up first movie  i think i still like first better  either way i definitely enjoyed    
4,i m original transformers fan original cartoon  there action start finish love story n t slow thing  i ve watched movie numerous times still see things i missed first times watch  loved it 
5,i like new love interest movie lot  also great extension last two movies  n t waitth 
5,i satisfied product speed i received i would business  i satisfied
1,if like special features buy version  they thing avatar  this release gets full price absolutely zero special features  not much trailer  they putting deluxe versions toward year includingd combo pack  blu ray combo pack  dvd  all packed  kick buy second time  many people n t features consider forewarned  and s like re giving cut price  movie  release 
1,digital copy expired  months ago unable put ipad  would bought knew digital copy wasnt included
1,ugh  what steaming pile predictability movie  at least i n t pay see able read software tech manual  watching   the plot thinner paper written acting  well typical michael bay means see believable productions local high school  it easily hour long special effect used hundreds  i think saddest part hearing lenard nimoy optimus sentimental  i mean sentinel  gratuitous sci fi pandering s lowest 
1,i used search window using   d movies  criteria movie popped along dozens  d movies  i received  i realized i read description close enough see movie not  d amazon please n t place  d movies selections  d ones  i pay   return item n t offered search  d movie selections  ouch  all i love amazon  i ll careful future  my bad 
1,standard michael bay garbage  totally removed original idea  especially concerning optimus prime s character  the ideals character originally stood completely ignored favor kill shots murican tough guy crap 
1,continuity  story line unknown  unrealistic  continuous  special effect show even good 
2,two movies plenty  the hot girl ridiculously hot unbelievable good way 
2,i n t even remember plot  resolution  much else  however  i n t remember painfully bad previous installment  you go way watch  worse movies 
1,i got dizzy watching machines transform  i watched movie see chicago  i live  needless say  i like movie 
3,i n t see theatres  came blu ray  the story would expect transformers movie course lots cgi  the main complaint i girl replaced megan fox  i m fan megan fox  new girl awful actor character equally bad  at least megan fox s character acting could believe would thrive perilous situations  without running around super high heels always bright white clothes whole time   other complaint  i would say rest would expect type summer blockbuster 
1,it takes special effects make movie  the first film good nd mostly decent  unadulterated  predictable  garbage  full bad acting eye candy  the heroine could n t find coherent sentence conjunctive map  should stuck megan fox  at least real attitude 
3,read many reviews funderfuldbr make purchase  ran home like charlie willy wonka golden ticket  ploppled disc seen menu  knew good buy  after watched least  times inchd  bragging  give folks idea movie shown  must say  okay   yesd scenes nothing watchingd conversion sleepy hollow w jdepp dvd  there n t wow moments  overall imo  okay   watched titanicd several times week d  course entertainment value vary  
1,when i saw review giving movie  rd time respected source ever done   i listened  if  plot holes   plot chasms  there story  a special effects redeem gaping wounds make rest film  plot  charisma  fan service   michael bay really needs stop raping people s childhoods  south park george lucas style  go watch animated film instead save excruciating pain the dark side moon  i m talking pink floyd  
2,complete waste electricity  michael bay hungry years  therein lies problem  let s see happens inevitable sequel 
1,crap  crap  crap  bad acting  big explosions  video game cgi good movie make  like  hour hasbro toy commercial  this film made star wars episode jar jar binks seem like academy award worthy film  and i m superhero godzilla monster geek   awful   terrible  at least first semi watchable   s megan fox  that would redeeming quality junk fest   i mean alien robots change cars trucks    it s movie based toy god s sake  a bad toy made even worse film  avoid like the plague 
4,this good action packed movie sure please science fiction fantasy enthusiast  the story starts alternate history moon landing alien discovery twist moves become fast paced action movie familiar heroes except  new romantic interest  the new romantic interest  played rosie huntington whitely  fails measure previous played megan fox the sound video first rate rattle rafters crank sound high enough  the story line holds ones interest provides enough surprise elements keep guessing  this worthy addition franchise keeper collector genre i recommend highly 
5,dotm made easy forget  s rotf  the  plot  much improved  possibly one writer time  some best action sequences i ever seen movie  a great way series  well  if made  i would hope would military autobots working together hunt decepticons  similar rotf started out please advice  good movie nothing studio wanting get consumers buy movie twice  if disagree  spam studio correspondence rather deduct stars review try way next time   dotm fantastic action film  i disappointed blu ray release hardly extras  otherwise   stars      
1,bad acting cheap love story make worst transformers movie date  i wish transformers movies would focus actual transformers movie instead bad love story  i remember transformers animated movie transformers n t try focus much humans problems  the fight megatron epic unicron amazing villain  and rivalry skyscream megatron made interesting plots decepticon side  the exploration fights distant planets fun exciting  my suggestion make movie great instead bad mediocre fire bad actors movie strictly transformers backgrounds  or simply remake animated movie actual motion picture 
3,if re special features  wait special edition released later it s good movie  dragged little  glad s 
1,disappointing  the plot sam really lame  woman got fiance worst actress ive ever seen  pretty sure model doesnt know first thing acting  movie ok action movie buy expecting something first two movies sadly disappointed

5,mil gracias producto fabuloso recomiendo vendedor llego perfectas condiciones excelentesaludos espero seguir contando ustedes
1,this rated worst movies i ever see  i found total waste time  unless devoted transformers fan must see things transformers stay away movie 
1,i searchd movies amazon instant video movie came  i purchased i disapointed see n td  i writing review without watching  minutes movie s movie bad  amazon needs re labeld movie selection 
2,less plot first movies  fell asleep twice watching  despite explosions   seems like writers may running ideas
3,i found movie ok  definite improvement second  i  glad slowed transformations i could see change reasons watch movie  i find story line level kids dialog follow much adult content  that  kids today respect anything  imitate movies  unfortunate  
2,it took minutes  these transformers movies keep getting expensive equally ridiculous  the first charming really funny  especially first half  the humor reminded armageddon  i actually liked shia labeouf back  this tries way hard every aspect fails almost  i understand movies taken seriously  i mean step power rangers   movie could ve presented much better the reason i m giving star special effects action sequences exciting times 
3,i asked grandson instruction i watched  moved fast keep going 
5,like transformer movies great  play never get sick seeing 
1,this disappointing film  the first two films managed include story special effects  this n t really bother  mind numbing  bad way 
1,lots loud noise quick movements  just kinds things monkeys idiots enjoy  please   love god  make another sequel  this movie really sucked 
2,20 dollars   hours i never get back  i disappointed movie i actually embarrassed i bought last friday came  my kids excited  hours even enough  during scene building crashing my  year old asked what optimus prime go lunch break  once show made short work bad guys  the action scenes amazing first became boring tedious real fast  shia lebeouf awful  stupid jokes always seemed inappropriate times  john turturro s character may stupid  intelligent character movie ever  no character development  real emotion transformers many scenes never even fought back  if rent skip first minutes  n t buy s worth 
4,okay  first i say i absolutely loved dark moon honestly believe probably best three movies  special effects spectacular blu ray everything seemed clear unbelievable the problem i   special features  or maybe  lack thereof  i honestly admit i n t really look description see special features   s new movie   i pretty much thought new movies came some kind special features  deleted scenes  commentary  gag reel  something   but n t leads believe ll probably re release three together special  d  blu ray pack never before seen footage  etc   etc   which reason i m giving  stars instead   that  nut shell  irritates peediddle outta    
2,just got blu ray found dts sound unlike description says amazon  wait better version 
1,this company advertisedd movie  when i received blu ray  they told i would ship back prove  i upset horribel work 
2,there s much say s dumb movie  thing going  pretty colors flickering fast  a great movie give brain rest  best viewed mute 
2,i know sounds hard believe  movie loud  spectacular   i bored giant gizmos shooting  i fell asleep 
3,i n t realize i made purchase i would getting jacket movie  it came plastic disc cover  the movie works  resale value collector value without jacket 
5,i really liked movie  i first two dvd despite lot people think michael bay s movies  i took  fun movie bringing iconic childhood toy life  i grew watching cartoons really excited i heard going live action movies  now i enjoy movie second  i hated revenge fallen  i loved action sequences special effects  i admit i watch actual transformers human actors  i n t patrick dempsey s character  i n t watch grey s anatomy i attachment actor i really n t like rosie huntington whitley  sorry  n t quit day job  acting n t thing  other  i loved movie  i m waiting collector s edition released later year  i special features 
1,the nicest thing i say movie really bad  there s talent burn cast burned script instead  the script terrible makes  never too young to die  look oscar worthy  rosie huntington like blonded megan fox without charm gravitas  ms fox n t exactly awash either tell wooden replacement   the movie actually painful watch first   least action scenes final third cool enough make total loss 
4,i must admit i thought third film franchise lot fun  notably integrationd photography  here though problem  becomes apparent paramount dreamworks eager release  throw version masses  minus expected extensive supplemental material  word deluxe d  version coming november december and given  highway robbery  price   paramount dreamworks thinks joe consumer utter twit buy anything transformers related drop  well  i n t buying version  i ll waitd version oh according paramount s press release msrp  amazon ripping us off  big time    
1,someone needs stop michael bay  seriously  this pile festering rot latest neverending assault popular well loved seriess  i honestly n t think i could hated movie bay personally kicked crotch peeing i watched  the arguably worse director uwe boll  noticeable difference bay s films budgets speak  avoid like plague 
1,in word horrible  i huge fan first two  watched cartoons kid  really could n t wait see movie  it horrible  rambling  incoherent  unfocused  i missed megan fox every minute pouty  big lipped female talking  fell asleep minutes 
2,like lame avatar release  extras either  i saw movie theater far  worst three  and milk s worth  how milk  pretty bad movie  stay away  unless true hard fan 
3,so disappointed  version special features  now i know i look little harder make sure special features 
3,female opposite main characther talent acctess stands looks pretty puffy lips looks swolen movie would n t buy free first ok waste anymore dollars movies what hapen john voight  gave   effort  special affects pretty intereting  least hour half 
5,i ve enjoyed movies  growing transformers i excited first came  this blu ray looks great digital copy great i travel 
4,i received message u s government hiding knowledge beyond earth s atmosphere  but governments hide information masses people  what intrigued sentinel prime character said optimus prime character used gods called machines  i relate statement  i descendant people performing high sciences point time beasts burden  try talk typical african person science see get  at best ll say  help pay bills  at worse ll look like  heads 
2,this dvd play well  i wish i would purchased elsewhere  the price much less equal quality 
3,the special effects excellent  the story easy follow writers wonderful job  as usual talented shia lebeouf carried movie made look effortless  again  was glad see return tyrese josh fearless fighting forces  looks like michael b got best actors   that exept female lead  never thought i d say   i missed megan fox  what casting directors thinking  i m going buy movie i actually stop think   something i i really liked film  if make another transformers s hint   beg megan back  do  it 
1,why i buy thing  well  i saw preview great  make mistakes  good movie like machines beating humans without humans make jelly the opening best world  if kept way   but  it desintegrated pieces  the fxs fabulous  n t make whole movie that sorry fans  i disappointed  i m kid anymore  s probably reason 
2,no surprises left  highly predictable plot  but great action scenes spectacular special effects  tires hard reinvigorate first episode  lacks suspense drama  my  years olds got kick  i got bored 
3,good movie years age i n t know put curse word movie words could used
3,maybe i m transformers person  i found long  drawn  boring  the plot rather ridiculous  usual  i m extremely saddened absence megan fox  i guess ve seen two  might well see  n t enjoyable 
1,absolutely rubbish  would feed film  simply good measure  you really ought find something else time  sure wish i 
2,this review reflect anything movie  i pre ordered item sept thinking i going get soon released  guess  it s octrd i m still waiting  will update review soon get movie  update  finally arrived pm oct rd

5,transformers  dark moon excellent movie  the adaptation animated series cinematic format completed great effect  the storyline imaginatively creatively thought out 
4,i huge fan transformers movies  i say best series  as much i megan fox fan  kept  i thought ending bit abrupt  not really way i would ended series   knowledge  last 
3,third installment transformers live action series  not good first two pretty major plot issues great action sequences good special effects  fans series certainly see n t watch expecting mind blowing plot 
3,this movie suffers imperfections review i the three musketeers  the movie fun movie watch  watchingd makes even better  the quality movie suspect  several flaws  scenes fade  couple black drop outs  last couple seconds takes away overall viewing movie  i n t give  stars i think deserves  whatever company put movie disc need check master copy flaws 
4,this great movie lots action intrege  being third movie series afraid gon flop great movie

5,just wondering coming next movie hehe  of  trilogy  s favorite 
1,well critics got right  michael bay good director got big lost perspective  dirty old syndrome  yes  joke  i looking forward intelligent sci fi got crap  the reference obama unreal world stupid  i came get away real world politics   the treatment woman movie degrading  glad actress bowed   tear   it shame good actors came back film deal totally self involved director  the animation excellent story trash  i soo sorry i spent money film 
1,wait black fridayd version released  gon like lotr bluray again first version theatrical version  normal length  second version extended cut
1,booooo  do n t buy special features available years  another clever studio scheme capitolizing consumers  yes  probably factored million copies sold    double dip generating flow revenue impatient believe  americans impatient  know rabbit s tail  do n t blue red pill    no rabbit holes running deep  peoples pockets succorred buying bare boned optimus   i hope truly helps  seriously 
2,i n t believe hasbro alowed micheal bay butcher franchise big screen  okay first okay  second pure imature garbage  dark moon meh    i say though g1 nods  enough  crying loud horrible job soundwave  shockwave  make bumblebee crazy warrior  goodness sakes g1 series recon transformer  fighter  would always get s butt kicked  and starscream getting killed sam  really bay  and course human flat stupid  crude  cartoonie  add stupidity trilogy  and megatron crap  make look like sad lost puppy rotf  dotm  alpha trion  excuse sentinel prime  never ark  and alpha trion never prime  they rename trilogy  bayformers 
2,some really nice animation segments held interest minutes time  mostly disjointed tiresome  the talented cast improves quality film  lot 
2,i recorded movie freebie i got dishnetwork wow let  acting really takening nose drive  way many actors many flat goofy love interest way much collagen lips makes look like hockey puck came across blond bimbo  dialogs  talking fast hard follow way much mumbling confusion going  makes glad i shell cash see  hasbro ashamed link  lastly hang money find online store less price movie ticket 
2,the special effects expect transformers series  story line unfortunately expect  it s disjumbled events getting thrown together  some parts movie flow well  others plain ridiculous  it s past time writers  director series either move grow quit turning every scene kind teenage behavioral prank  they ve done bumbling parents  stuttering idiot witwicky kid  jive talking robots  goofball super secret ex agent death already  how grown adults fighting planet s survival actually act like 
1,i glad i watched someone else s movie i spent money lousy thing  i always buy list  rose s worth seeing movie  it would better without together  and n t hold candle megan fox  i like first two movies total waste  boring word go things kennedy early space program  it would better cartoon  if another  i spending money  this boring middle i fell asleep i would waste money  borrow someone else s movie save money good movie oh i might give   since  scale gets i would given  movies    
1,the movie would n t play steadily  i watch netflix later an error kept popping saying internet connection n t fast enough play movie my internet connection fine  i watched movies  i checked online amazon s customer service page  i minimum requirements this first time i ve problems streaming amazon  awful  every  movie would stop pop error message  i tried restarting app  restarting ps  luck 
3,i m huge fan transformer franchise i bored free amazon prime i gave watch  it okay way kill time  i n t watch n t make fan franchise decent job killing couple hours 
1,not recommended children even teenagers poor story nothing new interesting i expecting something better dissapointed 
1,man  i wanted like movie  i m big sci fi fan  i think revenge fallen bad people say  i even enjoyed first transformers   oh my gosh  what piece garbage  i rate avatar  movie version nickelodeon cartoon  fan  huge let  i forgiving sci movies i expect much way plot story line  i big fan cool special effects  corny  cliche chock full redone rewritten old jokes plagarized scenes  even i could  i becoming angry even  writing this  piece copro cinematic excrement  much    
1,first  movie incredible special effects  script acting horrible  however  real problem package disc special features 
2,oh please   movie n t tell story much show special effects replay platitudes  should ve left well enough alnoe instead making far too long sequel 
1,the plot terrible  the acting terrible  the effects good ones  if see pure action without story  enjoy  otherwise   complete waste time 
3,the movie good d graphics could better  i would recommend movied graphics important 
4,i play video linux despite fast computer good nvidia graphics card  the video starts playing retarded amazon notification pops saying n t play flash player unfixable  well started playing stopped due pop drm  amazon need knock now the movie fine 
1,bought digital copy expiration date elapsed  nothing amazon site indicates expiration date  the package warning outside inside  amazon offered full refund  that s stand company opinion 
3,the problem replace original cast loses it s basis  not mention happened original girl  she least showed breakup  otherwise great film  can imagine spock bones replaced  how robots lost in space star wars replaced  or princess substituted sleep around slut 
2,this suppose great movie fell short expectations i  i huge fan transformers since came early s  it s sad think could big screen  i hope redeemth installment  bring hot rod ultra magnus original series  i hope n t poor film  i disappointed  as hard say  it really bad 
2,i liked enjoyed effects s everything entertaining movie  the quality  blue ray ps  pretty bad ass story line mediocre depth  the acting sad times and importantly i missed megan fox  someting n t right new big upper lip girl  maybe megan would better movie  guess never know 
2,they need get new director new script writer  they keep getting worse worse  get rid witwicky s  it funnyst time  everything drawn out  i never saw theater bought blu ray  i m regretting it  i n t understand n t use original voice megatron  i n t watch another one  they add dinobots  make devastater like cartoons  robots merged giant  cross cement mixer garbage compactor  cmon  shame  it could great someone actually cared 
1,transformers movie   awesome  but transformers look like pile garbage throw together  the cgi animation makes everything look like synthetic barf  the transformers movies need reboot  characters actually look like supposed  and without worlds worst director michael bay  disgusting  do n t let kids watch atrocity 
2,i went see hope getting revenge fallen s bad taste mouth fission mailedwhere begin  the plot  nowhere near  immature  rotf  still suffered clogged much filler making much sense  it s overlong mess cgi eye candy redeeming factor film  it s clear bay knows make big budget action film explosions aplenty  write decent script movies save life  it s fort n t since the rock  the movie peaks huge  final battle chicago nuts  wanting time finally takes place  thed well used spots  make fact almost everything letdown  do buy unless really complete collection 
3,it contain digital copy  must enter code download copy  this false advertisement  period  i limited bandwidth begin   hours download copy portable use  well possibly folks get cap fees data downloads  plainly state digital download  digital copy others i purchased include digital copy seperate disc   easy pie copied hard drive  minutes less overall movie okay  reviews basically state  i sawd theater  okay 
4,this item suppose contain digital copy blu ray dvd disk  the digital disk included  package advertising suppose included  what happened 
3,surprisingly good movie  i n t expect good  i liked special effects growth main character 
1,the dvd playable since hour minutes  picture becomes stopping going keeps way 
2,michael bay movies meant action packed fun cheesy goodness  which  the reason i m giving bad review amazon instant prime edited parts   it s pg1 movie       it n t need edits  considering much pay year prime  i expect able watch full movie 
2,poorly acted  written plotted  sci fi action movies thing i could n t get seemed like involved  phoned   worst movie i ve seen long time 
1,two dimensional characters  dropped plot points  flat dialogue  bad acting overall story makes comic book look shakespearean  michael bay ruin everything touch  and i m worse seen 
3,eh  shia lebouf great actor   everyone dumb movie  if i m hot  british actress   i n t think i stand middle giant alien robots shooting  if i small human  i n t venture heart chicago  alllll alian badguys  just find girlfriend  although s fricken hot  it felt rushed  good movie  revenge fallen way better
4,great movie special features  once i opened movie i noticed off coupond version coming special features 
2,i n t say movie n t moments  far  and know horrible  horrible memories everyone grows  kind scream  embarrassment  high volume  years later  reminded fact yes  stupid enough say front people  this movie chocked full moments 
2,most time n t tell re looking  everything dark gritty  there explosions time  i m sure  nothing seems get damaged  the transformers garbage  once  new ones introduced particular reason i  movie quite cavalier killing fan favorites  the plot thin  ridiculous  huge plot holes  bad guys bad  good guys n t particularly good anymore  casualties nobody seems about this movie evoked nothing hatred michael bay 
2,the plot storyline cohesive  the movie way long characters really coming life  making movie longer making movie better  in fact  movie weak  making longer makes point even  painfully  obvious i kept watching movie see would improve unfortunately case maybe dreamworks move another project save money intend buy  better rent save rest better movie 
2,i m huge sci fi fan i ll watch almost anything  this watch movies  a huge disappointment enjoyable  the first half movie spent trying make lust huntington whiteley  she dimensional s impossible like  let alone think s appealing  there zero chemistry huntington whiteley labeouf  they wasted half film trying show labeouf could worst bumbler time everyone knew  somebody studio obviously n t understand sci fi audience 
4,a great smash movie  usual transformers  michael bay directing proceedings  hope make t  i m certain still decepticons smote somewhere earth 
4,this good series ender  still line two lot s action  new girl  cuter megan possibly 
4,the movie expected d much better  definitly worth money  i pleased purchase 
3,rapid shipment item like new advertised  it original box  cheap clear box  the disk marks  clean like new 
1,transformers  seriously terrible terrible movie  yeah wow cool  special effects seen time time  ridiculously long battle scenes incredibly boring literally make fall asleep every time watch  terrible story  terrible plot  terrible rendition classic characters  why i even gave movie third chance beyond 
1,i ll make short point quickly  i think shame bay starting milking cow not puttingd version set  pirates   thor  tron many others includedd version  i won t buy release wait  let s see long d release  i know many hated  i love   panasonic soooo looking forward  personal opinion  
3,i watch movies  transformers  entertainment mainly  the acting somewhat subpar  i like parents made appearance  funny  i n t really miss megan fox  new girl n t add much movie either  the action good scenes  i felt could shaved least minutes movie still came results  i think beginning movie interesting 
2,a boring nasa storyline n t make whole lot sense begin  sam gets new girlfriend trying find job  along way still annoying charectors mom  asian guy  dumb momments sam boss  movie long story  charector development  action last minutes  half hour movie  if robots fought moon i think it would interesting different location  instead get main villian robot memorable  repeat robots fighting causing destruction city  special effects amazing n t save poorly written movie  visual substance 
2,after seeing revenge fallen  i thought would way better  i thought would learned lesson  i wrong this movie   hour snoozefest i paid  see  i thinking dont make mistake  wait rent it heres do rent  get home  fastforward first half movie  fastforward john malkovich scenes then watch second half  try determine good bots bad bots  theres many hard distinguish shias new gf movie super hot thats enough save movie  it make hundreds box office suckers like 
2,the hd streaming always fails   the movie fun watch enjoyable  it would nice streaming quality held 
1,here rules   every time character says something s supposed funny comes completely lame instead take swig    every time movie veers completely random direction absolutely nothing what so ever anything  swig    every time transformer somersault twist air slow motion attacking take swig  follow simple rules ll bombed minutes  seriously  while watching movie i kept thinking many millions dollars spent provide us idiotic jokes red coffee cups yellow rooms effeminate assistants russian accents  every time i see movies  saddens  given insane visuals tight  serious stories could really made series something amazing  unfortunately s case  at least s leg humping  that s something i guess  
1,like like go specials features  making  documentary  bd buy  this second time i make mistake  the first time i bough avatar bd came  movie nothing else  it waste bd room space make releases without single special feature  wait special edition  full feature  bd release  the movie fun  bd price  usd price pays day see movie  i wait special edition  give copy young daughter lives mom  as i said  movie fun  price bd  last time i make mistake  i need patient fill mogul movie makers  pocket hard earned money  what think  any opinions

1,the decepticons play autobots like used violin demostrate cybertron s ai still long way go  while labeouf turturro act movie character s last episode   really over act movie lacks charm original tv cartoon 
2,150 minutes life back  first probably last movie review  move bad motivated time fair share trashing bit
2,i m big fan transformers going backs cartoons  this movie  like recent ones  major disservice franchise  but least looks good 
1,if ve wondering species ascending declining watch transformers  if n t wondering  i would like opportunity pose ironic question   what like mindless   
2,if years old  perhaps  bestest  films ever     but  close un watchable rest us  i viewed spielberg s direction  even could n t save pathetic  phony  ridiculous movie  just person actually thinks     even smarter average cats  dogs monkeys  total waste time 
2,this movie overall disappointing  i liked first two i really wantedd  this far worstd movie i purchased  the flying paratroopers reason seed  this movie like bad opera  went   thankful finally got inevitable conclusion 
4,i fan going repeat good things already said already know i comment girlfriend  she annoying  i believe british  the accent lips absolutely do not fit all american movie  she useless i learn ignore  no chemistry anything movie  it fit  they found american girl tough  rough  all american 
4,used unknown carrier  ensenda   package lost found  i could purchased best buy got quicker
5,absolutely awesome usual  one best actions series time   you ask anymore michael bay company provide 
3,i loved megan fox first two  i set disappointment  i avoided watching  it much better i expected  it held attention whole time  much action s hard  the dark side moon everything could movie  comedy  action  desire  teary eyed moments  when autobots said goodbye walked shuttle  i felt tears prick eyes  though i knew would back  i say though  part transformers movies go  n t favorite  and characters  n t much tie past movies  the things happened barely even mentioned previous movies  movie  could well stand alone movie with said i liked movie recommend 
2,cheesy  rushed much shia  bay s twist liked much better could done  but i know  the animated movie excellent compared crap even games war cybertron fall cybertron make movie look bad  action parts ok 
3,this movie goodd effects  does n t make jump seat feeling  cool dimensions  watchedst blu ray d blu ray  have sayd better  wish scenesd captivating  ok rating  surround sound added sensation times  consistent  a good part movie viewedd  never knowd  
2,i always problem understanding anything causes degree destruction transformers merit planet  then shia  makes hurl every time i see roles  the last thing i liked holes 
3,an average sequel movie  worst first movie much better second one pretty clear quality great action  too much focus humans  feature transformers bluray great contains no extra content whatsoever  only contains dvd digital copy 
4,just adore movie bought included digital copy i could transfer x oom  unfortunately digital transfer possible android devices aware 
5,seen movie theatre knew going must buy blu ray released  amazon always delivers promptly release date 
5,i bought preorder amazon could n t price  disc set  movie good like transformers movies s must 
3,i bought printer  years ago  it works great  the problems  power cord short  ink pricy  enough memory  freezes  sometimes print lines smear  i like hp printers think i stick hp long time  i going up grade hp laserjetnn home network  i think model defects newer printers hp fixed 
2,i ve p1000 couple years  worked great windowsme  after installing xp desktop i reinstall printer software get work  just got new laptop n t work all  fact  p1000 causes dell inspiron crash whenever i disconnect usb cable  when cable connected laptop never recognizes printer 
4,if looking home photo quality printer  pro quality good enough form   decent price  this printer i printx10 s amazing results  i even use scanner print negatives photos print better local store  i comparing hour development  i comparing local specialty store amazing reputation  just make sure use  course set printer  high quality photopaper  see amazing results i bought printer years ago never problem  i n t know newer versions better  i n t say bad word printer 
1,i really liked printer i first got  years ago  sure loud little slow  printed pretty good  well   years very light duty  i sudden start getting error messages pc telling printer connected computer  first i changed cord avail  i tried different open usb ports computer  ends i position usb cable perfectly back p1000 get work  at least would still work  right  well got six months connect  now hp p1000 nice new home trashcan i m giving canon try  if hp puts much thought printers computers i definetely n t buy another hp product  
4,  these basic large safety pins package  i always found buying assortments safety pins using large ones first  solve problem  these safety pins size  called  size    far safety pin sizes go  actually two inches  centimeters long  they nickel plated  fancy  job fine  save lot time hunting stores buying amazon  they seem sharp enough uses i  however  i n t think would good extra fine work  general usage quality recommended    
4,we organizing costume stock large quantity safety pins big demand  wish came larger quantity  serve purpose 
1,as another reviewer noted pierce cloth well basically useless  i threw trash
2,it depends purpose safety pins  i needed holding velcro place velcro pulling apart easily  these safety pins bent i tried stab material  the point sharp  surface rough  this rough point causes material cling safety pin rather allow pin pass easily i would recommend dritz quilter s safety pins  they nickel plated makes smooth rust resistant 
2,for cena s first movie  okay  lot s explosives i really would n t recommend movie  some okay jokes  story line kind weak  typical ransom  give back wife type movie  i recommend wait movie comes television  decide buy 
3,okay i admitt i love bad movies  boy i pick doosy  skip plot  skip hero  quick look wife bra  cheer bad guys  the best acting lines baddies  i loved robbery lines great  picture bad guys running knee deep mud swamp  then head bad guy stops answer cell phone  he tells partner deal  he stops conversation answer call waiting  now says   does include sports package hbo   do n t get started  rock candy  black guys mini vans  i truly soory bad dudes died  heck would make better movie 
5,love movie action bad crimanals get deserve end i recommend movie percent
3,wwe really needs stay rasslin making movies even though outside the rock  john cena ok 
1,i gave movie chance robert patrick  he could n t give justice  the action top unrealistic  the criminals cliched especially african american criminal   do n t know always make african american characters smart mouth  s stereotypical  john cena n t act way paper bag s damn bulky cucumber fingers  the car chase scene bullets hitting car cena still driving able avoid every single bullet  he s hit multiple objects still mark  the wife gets knocked hell many times bruise  this movie ridiculous n t waste time unless re cena mark 
4,ok first  i n t see movie winning prizes story  script  plot  anything like that that said  i think good action flick  it well casted  fight scenes well choreographed  explosions lots fun  also  i think good start cena  get acting lessons let try something n t involve much running around beating heck people 
4,i surprised much i enjoyed  surprised  little disappointed taste  anyway   you know exactly expect movie  explosions  fighting   s  luckily  delivers spades  especially splosions  i never seen many things blow  every fifteen minutes john cena barely escapes building blowing  and slow motion  course  the story kelly carlson kidnapped robert patrick john cena must rescue her robert patrick plain fantastic flick  the filmmaker smart gave lion s share line mr patrick  he plays great  sarcastic bad guy  plain simple  john cena act sense arnold schwarzenegger act  mr cena lets actions speaking  thankfully  plus  s hottie   overall  easy  cheesy  blow em up  action b movie  the extras pretty lame  though 
2,oh boy  seems wannabe rambo house  seriously movies got watch laugh  the movie lot action scenes  stuff blowing  people dodging bullets  none realistic  the good thing movie boosts n t seriously  it lame liners  even breaks third wall scenethe movie tells story recently discharged marine  arrives home begin new life wife  they decide road trip  good time together  wife gets kidnapped oh noo  yeah mr marine must save  in process beats lot bad guys  anyway s okay movie watch s nothing telimy personal rating   out of
5,thanks getting movie quick  really enjoy great shape great thanks
2,i like much   bought fact went high school thought would nice  it much action i thought would   a little dull   bad first   know get better  rock     
2,first acting bad movie  say  get e effort 
2,lots action  totally unbelievable  like watching wrestling  amusing enough watch 
4,good action previews show good part movie  good plot ending could benn better 
1,movie stinks hate movie movie ripped rambo yes movie ripped rambo movie stinks director producers actors actresses stink                                    easily worst movies ever made                     
4,i thought movie pretty cool part  robert patrick s role added s success suspense  lots action storyline well written  maybe john cena next big action star hollywood action movies general  i think continues make like   thought better rounds well peter j miller
1,i gave movie star reason kelly carlson beautiful  movie goes follows  marine gets dishonorably discharged seems ok  wife gets kidnaped  gets beat  knocked several times  gets burned  blown  overdone explosions walks away without scratch  movie pure hollywood  waste money time  really wonder producers ever spent time military  i never marine worth salt go telling everyone  im marine   every soldier i ever known talks like always bar fight altercation someone  it laughably stupid movie
1,hey im open wrestlers acting movies  the rock  hogan bit  i enjoy wwe s movies   plain bad  cena worst actors ever get starring role movie released theaters  attack show s chris gore put best said tried hide bad acting bunch explosion action  the storyline bad well already done million times  a guy s girlfriend wife kidnapped tries get back  wwe could easily found someone better  skip movie  in fact someone favor  buy dvd destroy would witness horrible movie  i would give i could  nothing movie good
1,john cena worst actor history  wiht corny quote stare another  shows fargone world film become  honestly cant belive people pay  john cena annoying acting unbearable  worse wacthing george bush s innauguration   dont buy  waisting money  joke  honestly dont get someone could watch unless ypu think attractive  unless like people act  s ur type john cena worst thing happen wrestling
1,this typical action film lots fight scenes gun fights little logic  it s amazing hundreds bullets fired point blank range getting hit people getting hit fire extinguishers  pieces wood objects without much scratch  and people surviving incredible explosions  without getting much hangnail  the directors attempt moments humor failed miserably  they funny wierd me i enjoy watching john cena action  arnold schwarzenegger fun watch  movie n t impress anymore wrestling  i think star five generous 
2,this movie bad acting thin plot  could much better  lots action  lots explosions n t seem like good blu ray quality movie  it killed  hours nothing would recommend friend watch 
1,if cover low brow action piece n t hint  re probably producers target audience  one things i think hurts hollywood irrepressible desire shove american flag throats making  patriotic  movies  we american flag  iraq  marines   wrestling    i guess cow tipping hobby enjoy much practicing suplex  movie you as review  stank  if see shelf local video store  leave there if re hollywood producer  please stop making movies starring wrestling  stars   if hulk hogan  steve austin  john cena  the rock ok  please stick day jobs 
4,you have to like the the action scenes and stunts  wild    alittle far off in neverland  and if you like john cena then you have to see it  but all in all a pretty ok movie 
3,a group diamond thieves kidnap wife recently discharged marine goes chase south carolinian wilderness retrieve 
4,this hard core action fans  there s little down time  run popcorn  if someone n t getting shot  punched  etc  things getting blown sunk water  there action scene i n t seen yet police car  several action scenes worth rewind i appreciate buff bodies   you give guys a plus working out chrissy k mcvay  author
2,this movie meant taken seriously   i think tried re live s action flick experience  if watch movie falsly lead believe blown still survive  fire extinguisher get right back  shot s times hit  the dialouge silly  however  acting pretty good  sit back enjoy laugh 
1,this far worst movie i ever paid see theatre  that say would n t make good rental  multiple viewers could knock viewing price cents person  would still much pay movie  wwe entertainment stick best  wrestling events story line better inside squared circle  outside terminator reference made robert patrick  total waste minutes life 
5,i skeptical movie featuring wwe wrestler  wwe wrestlers notoriously bad actors  movie produced wwe rather major motion picture company  however i wrong  the movie full action special effects  john cena respectable job acting  the theme plot entertaining  cheesey bogus  if like action movies  arnold  movies rambo movies much enjoy movie 
3,basicly story retired marine whose whife gets kidnaped hostage situiation  well s definatly action packed   completly true life  lots explosions fight sceans unnecessary  but fun watch n t mind random cars blowing place 
1,  really quite staggeringly  breathtakingly bad  unless re particularly fond big explosions   case ll absolutely love  if n t  prepare totally ridiculous woodenly acted without much conviction  not even robert patrick s nasty chief villain save monumental turkey  it good moment  minor baddie  seeing chasing ex marine  says   he s like terminator   gets annoyed glance patrick  played liquid metal terminator  terminator ii   
1,this first time i ve ever felt compelled write review movie i thought horrible  but movie bad i n t believe someone actually enjoyed this the liners  whole rock candy thing    what  was supposed funny  who wrote anyway  he tried criminal court waisting money time the acting worst i ve seen  i never able watch terminator  again oh  explosions impressive  maybe took away everything explosions would n t bad thanks  i feel little  dumber  sat whole thing 
3,john cena realisitic  made part genuine intriguing  he really portrayed going mind anger wife kidnapped  at time  clever covert  it unfortunate talent great looks  given substandard plot  he untapped skills charisma could make tremendous movie star story unique capitalizes expertise 
1,the music album could incredible however  low level line noise every track  audible range tracks seems like s  chopped   making tracks sound  muddled   one track flow seamlessly next  mastering tracks results extreme volume level changes i means audiophile  mp quality album terrible   i n t know mastering issues exist cd version album  
4,the score craig armstrong brilliant  if re hans zimmer fan like graeme revell  trevor rabin  etc  then ll love cd  filled vocal pieces tragic  still keep touch today s times  hymn  ruby  ball  hanging  disaster tracks look  great cd liked crow  devil s advocate  crimson tide  the negotiator 
2,there brief introduction images period coloring book covers  that star  however  need keep mind supposed coloring book  target audience probably children though frankly i know many adults adore sorts books  the images however simple black white lines drawings shading interfers coloring  also many images  blurry  details i n t think much fun color  but could cool reference clip art examples gothic style 
1,almost useless true coloring book due heavily inked gothic designs  some designs highly detailed intricate  yet totally useless inked already  the entire book consists gothic clip art style ink plate repros gothic pillars  gothic crown molding  etc  the images printed back back quality white stock paper  however  markers bleed  no limited recopy rights  even use  not even recopy use markers  the price justify product all this dover publication  published stemmer house publishers  best stick dover  least dover know re getting top quality aspects 
4,i pleasantly surprised find book readable even modern standards good read  although language parts somewhat old fashioned  archaic even    deal  good bet anyone would like england late s   love  adventure  even little humor 
3,wonder nobody reviewed book  think read many years it makes think popular cooky 
2,brought gift high hopes  sadly  hopes came crashing pitifully  i admit sony great idea  in fact  would perfect i m always wondering sang that song radio it s cute small  keychain  in addition  usb capability really handy  least newer computers   the product lot like website  cute  stylish  practical  i disliked radio station settings limited song information arriving slowly i would recommend holding better product 
2,the sony emarker awesome idea  understand nothing stopwatch depends data website powered sony broadcast data  this information seems need help   hour  wait playlist updates sometimes taking  days  the product cool  sony needs keep deal update website   i d wait months buying another sony iron bugs 
3,i got emarker mail i pretty impressed hardware  however  driver support terrible  i got fustrated starting playing win9 drivers provided i got work windows   if interested drivers email moon  home com i sent  i hope helps someone wants play unit sony n t u 
3,great idea product  needs improvements  may may happen  great idea times song check again giving lower rating software load windows me machines  also  coverage jazz classical stations  stated  would truly make remarkable product 
1,i sold item learn  opening corresponding web site necessary emarker function  sony terminating corresponding web service days   a great idea support 
1,do buy emarker  it shut sony   i received following email emarker com    we permanently closing emarker com service  to keep emarks information  print screens emarks pages for emarker refund information  please click   emarker com  thanks support the emarker team
3,sure  probably s supposed technical standpoint  s going cultivate awareness music already hear much  if tastes go beyond commercial mainstream music  ll likely disappointed find small  independent  and or college radio stations currently put playlists e marker web site  and knowing operations budgets work stations  might re able e mark research tunes would n t able get flipping channel waiting  minutes  as idea  e marker viable  i m still supplementing car stereo pen  paper  open ears 
4,i brought emarker  glorified time stamp sets easly  works fine usefull product  live big city like ny site updated every minutes seems outside big areas sol  neat little gadget good live area updated frequently 
4,this works like dream find song playing radio  there two problems i  however  one hassle hooking computer waiting day find song  in cities large population  songs get updated every minutes  the heavy flash use web site  this makes process finding song even longer  i high speed connection k modem  even problems  great function product makes original worth money 
3,i d classify device toy adults  everyday use  it looks cool fun play  use somewhat limited  while s good car  ll remember station radio set  and re waiting room place plays radio music  probably n t know remember station get home  also  s often delay hours many areas check station playing this device would much useful instead feature handheld radio  could automaticlly record station 
2,i live phoenix  az quite radio stations listed e marker  the main problem wait hours radio song information updated e marker s web page  also  listen station becomes problem remember station listening time heard song pressed e marker  trust  hard remember  listed radio stations listening  especially hours ago  i thought whole point behind product let remember 
2,the set real easy  site flashy  intended  play lists never updated  i no idea people give good reviews thinking  i live nyc  media capital world  n t work hip hop latin stations  n t work anywhere  if r latin music site tells stations supported mark song gives popular songs necessarily songs playing  it unreliable  i yet see work  times  i owned well month  if get  do n t  at least wait start working getting play list point 
1,do believe so called good reviews  this product nonsense simply does not work  i able install rather easily  however  flashy sophisticated website never updated  the play list never available  i dissappointed sony  great concept  good looking product usual fom sony  typical lack performance  my experience degrees good reviews i n t believe real honest 
3,this pretty good idea  people n t realize n t know radio station listening  you change manually  also  radio stations listed  i put car days  i n t used  i think people  they give thing free support advertising  n t worth  money  
1,this bought gift  completely unneccesary  it s simply case company using widely available technology make money peoples  ignorance   if i hear song i wonder    hmm    i simply log starcd website choose radio station i listening time  it uses data device  the thing device record times  if think worth spending money keychain timestamp thingermajig  go ahead  ill jot hand pen   i commercial otherwise affiliation starcd  i m impressed user  
2,when i first heard i elated  guessing song i listen called  then i connected website  at time ik modem  trying access sony s flash enabled site undesirable  impossible  i wait half hour figure three minute song called  also  fact i still write station i listening  doesn  defeat purpose toy 
3,it s worth   nice usb cradle use device  use mp player  the device  service pretty useless  it s often provided wrong song  n t count station re listening  software download really stinks way flashy  s always resident system tray  s fun bash desk though  nice rubbery feel   
1,this biggest waste money ever created  if know song much  call station ask  n t mind  really 
1,i m sure see everyone else s reviews product garbage  well  hey  pay close nothing  n t expect anything much return  just save money do not buy this product   instead  put gas car something 
1,do n t let sleek look emarker fool  s got bugs a plenty serious design flaws  here s reviews  written sony employees   literature n t say   e marker n t seem work aol  use another browser  set browser default   when plug emarker computer   automatically  loads marks site   least s s supposed  on  browsers  different computers  i n t quite gotten happen   sony seems concerned cool functional  top emarkers  inadequacies    designed flash interface get songs n t quite work either  simple html would fine  guys   spare agony wait version    this first time i ve irate enough something write review i assure everything true  
1,where space zero star  just purchased emarker tell thing  i read reviews first  all bad hear little thing true  i priveliged enough live area sony feels compelled offer service  i dont even station mark  the site terrible i cant even get program  enable   whats difference though  cant anything anyway  this typical sony  my advice  check ratings go website see even offer stations area  believe  wont tell work area  it  however  neat idea  needs lots work 
1,place say use depends radio stations area must belong service work none area south west florida seem least favorite stations seems music listen must lastest info buy yes feel like got ripped   thank sony
5,i m really happy emarker thing  i mark songs almost everyday wplj i download songs napster  i wait  minutes  sometimes less  get song  i m usually car really problem  it would great covered npr  it works windows pc work windows me pc home  the technology behind seems pretty simple  i think keychain product remembers time  it works flawlessly station  important anyway  the site bit slow  really slick design interactive  i wish held songs ten 
1,know web site gaget may tell radio listings information updated every minutes  that case radio stations i tried emarker  the song information i could get  information unavaiable check back hours   they dont even promise information hours  this fault emarker understanding radio stations update play lists every hours  so problem misleading information provided emarker site  caution buy product dont expect timely information emarker 
2,e marker started lose s appeal i problem driver  sony provided little assistance situation i basically solve trial error  the website easy manuever  receiving proper listings n t constant  i give sony credit coming idea  respect s potential  however  serves interesting eye candy piece key chain 
1,i tell i used small smart device called itag xenote worked very well  plus       it free   i used use bay area selection radios great  web site easy navigate  i could even get info real time great  unfortunately  start up  many others  close doors lack     too bad guys sony much money enough customers launch decent product   after playstation  fiasco launch  keep going       
1,use emarker depends emarker website  however  sony announced discontinuing website  emarker devices useless  do n t buy unless museum piece for us already emarker  sony graciously offered provide cash refund every emarker returned directly 
1,this product works exactly advertised  click button find song  the website n t set well  s slow annoying flash stuff  broadband s definitely usable unfortunately  s usable rest september  emarker com shutting  makes emarker useless  thus  star review  current users offered refund  guess buy n t get that i d write detail  i go print hardcopies emarks   
1,check web site www emarker com  a pity  this looked like good idea    
1,once get past hype  realize device    clock  when press button e marker  records time  radio station  when download information computer connect website looks song played station many hours days ago pressed button  if selected wrong station get different song if use scan button radio  product
1,i bought thing get names songs new york spanish stations  i checked  double checked  called customer service  still i got incorrect song information  maybe radio stations fault  maybe e marker s fault  i know does not work 
1,sony stopped supporting e marker offering refunds anyone already 
3,although product work fine  website shutdown make product useless purchase 
2,this unit quite difficult use  the button sensitive  sometimes causes false entries  the website complicated use  i think little work e marker good product 
1,before buying product i read reviews  unfortunately  i n t pay enough attention warnings product n t work  i thought i could trust company like sony deliver reliable product figured poor reviews result consumer error  i wrong  the complementary reviews site n t real  the product looks nice works like piece junk 
1,these emarker guys business  sure thing even works longer 
3,the sony emarker good idea  needs flaws worked first  but first  pros  long battery life  again  s really good idea   very compact fits pocket well the cons  the keychain low quality  it broke  weeks   you usually wait day find song   the  mark  button easy get pressed pocket   you lesten station  this lot worse sounds   sometimes  sony n t song   only songs clips recognize song  without n t know song marked   there many stations n t choose station  make sure check buy  goto www emarker com check coverage   major problem  if install emarker order instructions say  major problems  overall   i think wait new better model  bye  bradley

1,i m sure editors harpercollins thought changing powerful  controversial  imagery book  d sell copies  nothing like compromising art expression sell out  stars homogenized shadow original book 
1,without stephen gammell s artwork  pretty close worthless why would ever replace original  incredible artwork  the reality  harper collins  stephen gammell s artwork made classics the artwork unoriginal  least bit frightening  artful   nothing complement stories huge mistake  someone fired  at least five people fired   blacklisted this atrocity prospective buyers  go buy versions  oh  s right  re extremely expensive  i wonder  harper collins  you fools and good measure  fools 
1,how dare censor original   the stephen gammel illustrations incredible  the art made books great  the writing still good  new drawings nowhere near good old ones  skip buy old version    
1,alvin schwartz s stories always played second fiddle stephen gammell s art  without  book worth anyone s time money  avoid seek originals 
1,as another child scarred terrifying art style original books  i extremely excited hear re release classic stories  the books arrived today  behold original art replaced bland  uninteresting art would better suited r l  stine novel a wasted purchase

1,the original books contained haunting  even downright frightening illustrations still disturb day  they made stories scary  they original  artistic  beautiful downright horrifying  replaced bland  boring  shamefully dull  if something scare  find copy book original artwork stephen gammel 
1,many us remember wait list school community libraries borrow horrifying gems  yes  stories spooky  seeing local folklore print added eerieness  the important contributor scare factor incredibly grotesque pieces art accompanied story  this reprint features new  popular artist  however  illustrations n t terror inducing quality before for  i think reason lot mystery gammell s work  helquist s n t leave anything imagination  in gammell s work picture set happening to you  in helquist s work  perspective see happening characters  just n t  you google images check blogs see 
1,please buy new edition scary stories tell dark  the publishers completely replaced original dark  beautiful terrifying artwork pictures clean  kid friendly safe  they destroyed made collection truly special 
4,scary stories to tell in the dark classic campfire stories   the hook    me tie daughty walker  along lesser known tales like  alligators   may i carry your basket   some stories funny   the viper   i ve vipe vindows   the ghost with bloody fingers   cool dude  get band aid  others genuinely spooky  like  the guests   cold clay   the book clearly intended reading loud  many stories even tips reader  raise lower voice  stephen gammell s pictures mysterious darkly beautiful  i highly recommend book looking spooky read aloud 
4,scary stories tell dark n t really much plot  since collection short stories  in stories  the girl stood grave  plot girl given dollar prove stand grave  person s grave would n t grab pull  she stick knife grave friends know  she put knife grave  tried get away  held back  died fright  the setting graveyard night  the conflict girl tried prove fact stand grave night  person pull wrong  it n t resolved  girl died fright thought pulled  put knfe dress accident 
5,this  along two books series  classic  alvin schwartz s tales simple yet deviously scary  gammell s dark  surreal illustrations greatly enhance  actually  illustrations midly disturbing    is thing coming stairs  the voice    once ve read least couple  ll start realize scary world    instance   the girl stood grave     the red spot     no thanks    so give try   n t dissapointed 
5,you have to see how scary looking the pictures are in all of the books     that could definetely give you nightmares for a while even in some stories  there was not a picture of the wendingo  but the back of the book said it was a female spirit  and or a cannibal giant that kills for human flesh and anthropologists described indians wanting to eat flesh as a  wendigo psychosis    i m sure s spell word  
3,my husband got this book to read to our  year old niece  not very interesting and definately not scary  it was n t what we were looking for 
3,scary storyby alvin schwartzthe book is a good book it tells about a lot of differentscary stories for instance the first scary storywas called boo men it was aboutthree men who died in therehome then came back to hontand kill the people livingin his house i would recommendthis book because it s funny andit s a good halloween book

2,i disappointed book  i expected  real  ghost stories substance  the book short folklore legends 
4,last favorite r  b movement talk musical gumbo  much pressence flavor  alot important acts came along time period great hybrids styles  beats grooves  many incredible talents compilation 
4,very much tradition edgar rice burroughs h rider haggard  merritt early avatars swords  sorcery fantasy novels  he emerged pulp magaziness write novels went influence generation him _dwellers mirage i found nice combination things make early fantasy readable  by turns sly frightening full high hat adventure characterizes speculative fiction period leif langdon feels though never really belonged modern world feeling confirmed disappears separate society hidden natural phenomenon  he feels strangely home lost society discovers role meant play life trainspotters may interested noting merritt went sometime book co author story lovecraft  after reading khalk ru i certainly curious influencing 
2,dwellers mirage   abraham grace merritt  pages  rating   the writing style good elements great story present  if author simply written two comrades descending adventures hidden valley would quite fine  unfortunately plot confused main character really know half time eventually leading abandon friend completely the reader endures frustrating sense unfocused direction  forever waiting plot fit back together way feels right  perhaps author felt simple adventure needed twist sort  well feel twisted  good way claus kellermann200 aprilsci_fi_researcher  yahoo com
5,this truly wonderful gooseberry jam  it packed chunks gooseberries  i highly recommend product   it truly expectations 
3,for reason  indiana university published two different courses estonian  this  estonian textbook juhan tuldava  while book certainly good many language courses market  falls short level reached tuldava s course  terms user friendliness depth cover  for reason  i would recommend tuldava s estonian textbook rather course 
1,this would short book racism sexuality removed  i read appalachian literature class  i felt book racey i could n t enjoy reading  the vulgarity necessary  i feel called literature 
3,with step fountain water fountain noise  maybe good thing people  i wanted hear water effects office n t make noise  nice look  i m going try rock style fountain 
2,i first timer rather intimidating admit older woman mid forties  i wanted video decent  surely  atea s moves clear helped get good start  i quickly became bored lacked flow  i disappointed moves clearly shows connect together form dance routine  this i looking  for beginner expected make dance bunch new moves unrealistic  i continue look video offer  if i dance like front husband   mainly i learning  i would able show routine learning video i beginner n t know put moves together yet  the whole idea bellydance  belly exercise  confidence i need dance way 
3,i purchased several bellydance dvds videos i say i m glad i purchased used lesser price  i n t age video costumes makeup   i looking instruction i really n t find  i found exceptionally easy follow i n t think much time taken us novices bellydance  i n t afford lessons i live i rely video dvd  this really n t helpful  others may able follow better i n t found teaching style easy grasp follow 
4,just everyone knows  atea not stiff real life  she must camera shy  lot us   she excellent dancer  although could use bit meat  still  basic moves correct technique  s good starter video 
2,i dissapointed quality video  during entire video  could see woman reading cards behind camera  the ladies teach moves could make 
2,i group bellydance classes seminars workshops  this bellydance simplest form  atea ok good tape start sure serious learning  it introduces things like veil zills instruct  if sure dance shop around spend little money getting tape someone troup dances style interested well known  for example fat chance bellydance american tribal style aisha ali african dance someone well known egyptian turkish caberet  if serious investment you get good tape  beginner otherwise search around find several 
2,beginners would like quick view dance might advantage video  there attempt cover lot ground  none done well  altea angular  stilted dancing interesting  i would strongly recommend looking elsewhere quality dance instruction videos  i say first video i ve seen touches rhythm zill work  the variety costume interesting  worth price  i recently acquired several neena veena series dance tapes  these excellent beginner tapes  fun interesting show great little dance reward work out  this series would better choice beginners 
1,reasons buy video  she reads cue cards entire time   she s extremely stiff boring i watched video two years i owned 
1,i always wanted bellydance got first video  it i imagined quite frankly scared  bellydancers always something mysterious beautiful graceful  atea awkward watch comes quite bizarre  not anything imitate strive like 
2,if looking tape dance     n t it it s like documentary dance 
1,while basic instruction passable  technique dancers  including instructor  mediocre poor  what s truly terrifying frail anorexic women look  there s unfortunate sort l a starved skinny bleached blonde airheadedness production  belly dance powerful  grounded grounding ethnic dance form  however tape presents  wrap sequins wriggle husband  sort vibe  culturally divorced ugly american scary  made shave head get tattoos 
2,for basic instruction tape ok  her oral description techniques clear  atea relaxed instructions moves  in instruction part video seems like puppet controlled strings  she skinny  unattractive n t even attractive navel  she fails hold attention  her dancers bit better  whole tape seems contrived move natural flair  for verbal instruction  ok  visual efects get much better  and dance real joke  your money better spent suhaila 
2,this video let  the historical blurb beginning time waster  pain fast forward thru every time i practice dancing  i agree reviewers regarding time devoted  freestyle    improvisation   i new recognize moves put together quickly without commentary  i find struggling part  worse  standing feeling frustrated foolish  some instruction regarding transitions move another would appreciated  on positive side  actual breakdown moves helpful  especially belly roll undulations  i really struggling  i m confidently way  i wish covered moves manner  bottom line  s week  i m already seeking another video buy 
2,i found tape disappointing  fun watch  amount information provided small choppy  there many belly dance instructional videos available interesting  better taught informative dance provide workout well  my recommendation keep looking 
4,this video advantages others i bought several ways the photography clear moves close enough dancers  relevent area  allow someone new like actually understand doing she explains clearly  pretty rare  the secondary dancers different segment segment highlighting thier strengths getting better taste different styles there dance sections showing moves shown used dance overall good  wish i could find teacher las vegas 
1,since i ordered product inspite company debiting total amount product account  i recieved product date  the company promises deliver product hrs approx  weeks since amount debited  product hasnt reached  the company doesnt respond email queries toll free number  point contact mentioned email address  always sounds busy goes voicemail 
4,but divisive statements like   d needed hip hop  if n t say something nice   
1,bill nichols full words empty thought  you need machete slash tangled sentences book  ll find beneath simplistic  flawed ideas n t developed buried verbiage  nichols stitches suffixes prefixes ordinary nouns  creating monsters like  situatedness     hyperrationality     reconceptualization     polyvocality     relationality     talismanic      pseudo literate s favorite word   juxtaposition   each words costs much time understand whole chapter erik barnouw s book  succinct  informative even humorous   mr nichols sealed cave books slung outer space  pollute body film knowledge  do n t buy  representing reality  unless know confused mr nichols s reality 
2,whoever mastered cd idea  makes wonder cds label like   they use one quarter dynamic range available bit audio  five bucks pretty cheap disc  get pay case  i d probably opt eddie fisher cd multiple albums  christmas cd  
4,this better books i ve seen gives real feeling morocco  lifestyle  culture  colours  ambience etc  there s wonderful balance writing photographs  none  touristy  style pics    s pieces read  finish  away real feeling place  real respect s historical contexts my downer bookbinding technique miles lightweight pages quality weight  second opening stem came unstuck fell apart  still  tender loving stay top coffee table years come worth grabbing romanticised love north africa s people 
3,book arrived in poor condition with the back unglued  otherwise it is a beautiful photo essay
3,this beautiful book  unfortunately  cover broke away binding couple readings 
1,n t cd  christian goth group disappeared i see  anything special  collector christian goth  friend bands  fan get otherwise n t waste time 
4,if know idaho assembled geologically   it readable book topic complete tomes  i strongly recommend amateur geologist

4,electric sykchurch is a wonderful example of todays rave scene  wandering through your body like a flow of positive energy  its a great group to listen to  when the sun is coming up  at a desert party  a perfect end to a night of dancing

1,nearly good usual work hoping hear forget pale comparison authors n t style
2,i sympathetic perspective author  arrogance smug conclusions  he much demagogue taste  liking much degrade disagree adversaries  this well beneath normal standards sponsor  the cato institute  usually holds exceptionally high standard i much prefer similar far intelligent respectful works warren brookes julian simon  they good n t require  attitude   in contrast author frequently tv  perfect medium condescending sneer mien  this book n t belong shelf henry mencken  wickedly hilariously debunked quacks  pass buy  the vintage mencken  read evisceration chiropractic 
1,the author funded big industries explains selection certain topics huge bias reflects  no matter many good reviews bibliographic citations appear  ideas expressed reflect corporate interests scientific knowledge  always look source   research well people s funds tell little bit real issues 
4,i used book supplement statistics qa courses  the book pretty well written points great examples misuse statistics 
2,i big fan kate bush  i collected music  including cameo appearances groups  yet i agree reviewers regarding cd the good thing album artists indeed attempt render original  different versions kate bush s wonderful songs  however  i find talent little limited listening album made little sad  made wish real tribute album kate bush released  versions artists peter gabriel  the cure  depeche mode  morrissey  annie lennox  phil collins  tori amos  etc   the fact album highly rated reviewers shows desperate fans recognition talent  uniqueness  influential nature kate bush s music  especially rather popular female artists followed  
2,well first i purchased album i full hope  curiosity impatience  i admit i starving new work kate bush  hint  hint  i know i alone  anyhow  i listened   i realized unfortunately  i really liked remake  suspended gaffa  favorite  original  s record star   i quickly skipped listen classic  running hill    i cried  i sorry remake well average  i agree another reviewer expressed wish high profile artists performing kate s awesome art  i surprised n t done far   however offense artists challenge performing kate s songs  power  however i wish came something better 
2,i would buy  teaches non standard supposedly  new  methof casting
4,all paxton quigleys self protection books written women general excellent advice sexes  men usually stronger  larger women well trained female use firearm knowledge use todays society almost necessity  i purchased books gifts women i  guide points correct direction 
2,paxton quigley s book compliation parts books firearms self protection  it s bit overdone  probably would scare average woman thinking protecting  women seem special problems protecting  they usually hurt anyone  anything baby family member anything protect  however  women able continue practice hand gun  usually become quite proficent  they know n t know  listen instructions  most think know already 
1,i looking piano songbook childern play piano  i realized songbook price  it comes electronic toy piano  the songbook play numbers nothing somebody learning play piano  very disappointing  age level pre school  able read 
5,this spectacular stunning piece film making  powerful anti war film  if watch film today haunted disturbed  paying attention  i watched recently first time years came away shaken  i n t help wonder dvd people film widely available  as   if people watched film might asking questions  leaders  would rather left unasked  if seen film  number years since saw last  i recommend  it overt anti war film explicit anti war message  seeing  view world events eyes  i promise 
5,david lean could have directed almost any film he wanted at this time in his career  and he chose this provocative and emotional story of a little town in ireland  this movie is different than any other of his  including the early ones  the casting is superb  could not be better right down to the small roles like maureen  i saw it when i was with my parents who were lean fans  its his best film  treated by some as his worst film  i expected to see alec guiness in it  but there is no real role for him  the complexity of the peoples lives in the film is amazing and i think ahead of its time for film viewers 
2,a surprisingly bad film  painfully slow paced convoluted  it really hell mess  the exploitation pitiful malformed character  played john mills  top  insensitive  tasteless comic bent  frequently employed  demands mention  the story feels minor begin  disjointed inane  best described story  the music hard describe  i ll kind  s helpful  the reason see film absolutely gorgeous  almost hypnotic cinematography  that perhaps young radiant sarah miles  that enough save film tough aggressive editing  little devotion good taste  but instead forced endure kind personal career psychosis great director  david lean 
2,beautifully photographed over produced historical women s picture epic scale  yes  fans dime a dozen bodice ripper romance novels supermarket racks  still  gorgeous cinematography lusher than lush musical score n t disguise fact david lean misfire overblown snooze elephantine proportions  a pallid sarah miles manages suggest julie christie might done part  horribly miscast robert mitchum plays flower pressing milquetoast dazed looking christopher jones bad voice dubbed  however  john mills received richly deserved oscar portrayal village idiot struck dumb plot inanities witnesses mute silence  no wonder s speechless 
2,the lead actress poor job acting was recently ireland stopped location film 
1,when i purchased product  i thought i getting good deal cheaper price  however  i received  i knew i made mistake  i ve using product several years  i knew looking n t right  the texture incredibly thin  color much lighter  something could leave believe maybe water added it lesson learned  spend extra money   re paying quality 
5,we used decent quality camcorder bought  this pleasant surprise  although picture quality might like  stars  features provided low cost make  star product  it fundamentals beginner fits well medium size small size hands  unlike require two hands large hands cost five times much small form factor   we box minutes recording first videos less minutes  the price makes affordable school kids kinds fun projects 
2,the on off switch stuck  i therefore record review tapes  i pried switch made temporary contact confirmed camera record play back i would like able return full credit repaired 
4,i purchased camcorder used   it great camera price  it s easy use picture good quality  i bought gift  age   handle well 
2,sounds great wondering already  stars  think would great  year old 
1,bought item july stopped working december  specficially  playback function stopped working 
1,this camera semed ok first   less month i bought  eyepiece viewfinder broke displayed white screen  in bright light  like outside  entire screen unfocused light object filmed ends looking like filmed sun  filter light well  the battery lasts hour fifteen minutes viewfinder open  great re charge this camcorder lower class model samsung  overall i thought cheap waste money  for dollars could get reliable sony the camera pros though  mirror  negative  mosaic art effects dse button fun  worth hassle camera gives overall  my advice  do n t buy it 
3,it right match price features balanced i brough use india  ac dataptervhz thats wonderful  the pal feature looking  its smal land compact makes handy  the title feature provided  select title recodings list overall best price could get may two years  planning dispose buy minidv would cost much less now so untill then scl700 envy 
1,like korean cars  korean camcorder says  s something ll proud  the controls awkward   even sony s compact minidv camcorders better buttons  the video quality  unit  i received factory sealed gift  broke  months  first asian electronics i owned  for little bit money  buy much better camcorders japanese manufacturers 
5,this album proof jason robert brown musician s musician  mastered many different forms popular music  each songs could stand brilliant song  none style feel another brown s pure talent shines album  several moments beautiful i get chills listening  every lyric harmony precisely placed  music always fits idea song naturally  there amazing performance moments album  brown incredible pianist singer addition composing arranging talents this probably album i listen  i would recommend anyone  it packed amazing musicality do n t listen trying get work done  songs steal attention keep whole duration cd 
2,i really like songs new world last  years  excited purchase disc kinda disappointed  lacks edgy variation creativity others  bad cover track fun  success jason robert brown work 
4,i fortunate enough lake douglas instructor  he forgotten landscape architecture people ever know  i love going class genuine passion subject almost limitless knowledge  buy book  you n t disappointed 
4,what crack  april in paris  basie band ella f track singing joe williams  too close to comfort   bunch tracks joe taking lead great swinging instrumentals alternative sides the whole album works well  great sound  exciting music  especially like croon joe williams the famous  joe williams sings cd  basie considered better  arguing fact  cd nice addition library great blowing  versions one o clock jump make worthwhile 
3,this perfectly fine  swinging count basie record great joe williams vocals  it annoys heck ella sings duet williams track gets top billing  it great version  too close for comfort   the disk includes joe williams classic version  smack dab middle   docked star annoying marketing 
3,it s good album  i d give stars i n t thought i purchasing ella fitzgerald album  it quite disappointment put cd player hear ella s beautiful voice tracks  joe williams good  sounds nothing like ella  this album refiled basie williams 
3,i purchased audio book husband whose game well beyond skill level addressed book  he told book would probably good players hoping break  need help developing proper golf swing 
1,i bought printer new  hps top line  i disappointed day one the print quality fine  the duplexer joke  it needs bottom page grip paper  print area  the driver software gives two options deal  print everything  scale squeeze content printable space  re sort pages allowing sw move page breaks  neither appealing  i found i reverted manual duplex mode  taking paper reversing myself the biggest problem i printer frequent paper jams  even using hp brand multipurpose paper  i find printer jams  time  in quest speed  paper load mechanism fast  pulling many sheets paper instead 
3,i ve used hp deskjetcse main home office printer year  print quality consistently good i complaints  it n t print color transparencies particularly well  i ve never really expected  preferring  instead  use color laser stuff  i n t use much maligned duplexer  however  single envelope feeder extremely temperamental jams frequently  i d estimate every ten envelopes i print    jam  jams necessitate opening lid prying mangled envelope  other envelope path  i m generally pleased printer 
4,my garage working  months and research bought product right away garage started working great 
5,great purchase  i frustrated i could n t figure causing garage reverse direction feet  this easy fix  everything packed well shipped fast
1,i small business important envelope feeder work well  from day  nightmare  components printer block envelopes labels n t feed properly  if use internet postage  lose money misfed labels envelopes  i m disappointed shopping new printer  short time purchasing 
2,until product  i huge promoter hp printers  hp apparently designed little attention apple compatibility  unpredictably refused print firstssx  i m frankly sick downloading reloading new drivers find n t work and or freeze entire computer  because printer i ve cleaned entire hard drive  lost valuable files programs  still wound non functional machine  it s closet  months  i m considerably happier new bottom of the line canon printer 
5,this good  inexpensive printer it easy  stillvery gadget illiterate  install use 
1,i two hp printers  both broke places  paper shoots printer  wings  arms  guide paper printer  broke easily also i get annoying message computer  yellow box marked   therefore i exit printer mode reset yellow box  deleted  then go back printer mode  this annoying i never getting hp printer again if look instruction book  annoying message never resolved  resetting message yellow          
3,but good slo burn unida  john garcia s current band   the music pretty boring vocals thing redeems album  garcia s vocals improving since demise kyuss tell listening cd well material released aforementioned groups   motherload  good midpaced song cool riffs n t push envelope  only suggestion hard john garcia fans 
2,i guess i m totally meaning grindhouse  one would assume title tags would sex filled movies little plot thrown good measure  they full slow moving plot sex scenes would make censors proud

4,when i first heard group canada  us release  i n t know think  here band anarchists  good could  apparently  good  i impressed i heard first track simple  memorable lyrics could get crowd floor dancing singing  i like amnesia even  s otherworldly quality left center  their musical style n t stuck genre  free experiment words rhythms diverse things musically without us going crazy trying keep  all worthwhile endeavor  definitely must get 
2,this c d  definitly expecting  some songs like  different words fpr like five minutes  i definitly n t recomend 
3,chumbawamba  whose not mean  hit wonder  swahili  manage get times  maybe times caught   album  while  tubthumping  deserved hit   amnesia  probably ve well  nothing album flat out bad  several lines n t sing well  s often difficult tell exactly s espoused  of course  like driving beat musical arrangements  forget  toss dance around 
3,this cd  far personal faves goes  probably gets   this  personally  i n t much type music  pending bias  i think like chumbawumba s tupthumping   ll like  some songs cd ability get psyched energetic  i m practically anemic  mary  mary  featured beginning hit new patricia arquette flick  stigmata   all  chumbawumba s stuff original  depending s mood  easy fun listen  if pride despondent dysthymic  though  might fare better the verve james horner soundtracks 
3,i d rather buy uk version removed  most  liner notes lyrics removed using bleeping thing
3,i n t say tubthumper  bad cd  however  s good cd  neither  i think chumbawamba s style favorite  i find tunes kinda  patience challenging   however   chumbawamba s lyrics  filled political social criticism  worth bucks  the lyrics really good  they deal politics  social problems  religion   i enjoy lot  and i actually like bands ideologies  long nazi racist  course   we much songwriters like chumbawamba  not lyrics deal silly topics like love stuff  and tunes bad  so i recommend cd  i think fact closer  stars  stars  s    stars rating  well  hope helps  take 
2,this cd sends wrong message  anarchy   plain bizarre  trust  ll tire  save money go buy barenaked ladies 
2,the good song first track  unless find single first track  save money  the rest cd trash 
1,the star one good song cd  tubthumping   actually  song blows hear  times  this cd cd player   that day bought  if like wasting money  buy cd 
5,granted  songs album decent  great  however  four songs are great  tubthumping  etc   incredible literally blow rest songs away  it worth paying twice price hear amazing four songs 
5,while chumbawamba s recent musical efforts left little impression music scene  debut album  tubthumper  remain  thumping  dance club beat different drum  for unexplainable reasons  i find coming back album time time  the music let go  it s enjoyable  entertaining  fun   tubthumping  unrellenting statement defiance   amnesia   s persistent guitar riff catchy trumpets not leave suffering  long term memory loss     the big issue  contains tatalizing chorale  catchy  lyrical tune   mary  mary  probably favorite questioning sanctity catholicism chambawamba may go  let known  there band wierd england  whose music fun listen  coherant  made anarchy seem like fun  god save  tubthumper   
4,damn  still selling cd  well  friend gave couple years ago  i liked tubthimping  although i n t crazy  actually  s good song cd  amnesia  drip  the big issue  scapegoat awsome songs  others  some songs never really caught onto  good music  anarchy rules 
2,it may  much  tubthumping gets boring listening  times  amnesia best  song ok 
5,even though chumbawamba s popular single america tubthumping  least favorite song album  it s way slow  the rest songs really fast  great beat  if like music beat  must get cd  hey  even better  many chumbawamba s songs actually meaning  brain  there total songs ten mini songs cd
2,i ll first sadly admit  i bought album heard  tubthumping   that huge mistake  if re considering buying album  please do n t   tubthumping  gets old anyways  the rest cd hardly worth listening  there mediocre songs  trust  worth  money  
3,this weirdest cd i ever listened  i n t know s called s make song longer  that s cool  at  amnesia   hear lady talking brains   scoop brains  blast brains water air    the first time i heard  i thought really weird unusual  i disgusted changed rthe song  now i think s cool  how put bits pieces random stuff songs  cool  they n t songs  i like music  scapegoat   
1,tubthumber reason i wanted cd i got  about times radio plus cd  now i n t stand tubthumper the lyrics music keep repeating  all songs bad lyrics negative  this best choice 
1,this cd pure crap  the songs pitiful shaky  your money would better spent anything else besides cd 
1,minus  tubthumping   listening album equal putting head frig  slamming  avoid hype  not even good dance music 
1,i used fan modern music  cd almost turned modern music completely  gift friend   there good song   tubthumping   i n t know  i thought  i get knocked down    anyhow  good song  the rest bad  except  good ship lifestyle   okay   the good part cd i turn  sisters step room almost instantly  so  re looking way disturb peace  
1,is anything less star  this might worst cd i ever listened  one friends bought used  shortly came  note fact future reference  came  people already selling used  sucked  the lyrics positively nonsensical  nothing creative interesting instrumentation  melodies  etc  there s song say  drip drip drip goes water   what heck supposed mean  more like  drip  drip  drip melts plastic  since i left trunk car 
3,these work well item exactally size  if covering smaller sits top  bigger n t streatch enough
4,i printer approximately four years absolutely no problems  it dependable reliable  very efficient  i would recommend 
2,we printer  weeks cartridge already needs replaced  we excessive amount printing  i think little soon run ink also printer jams easily  reasons i replacing last hp printer i  i feel i spent much time fixing paper jams i printing  it easy fix jam  little frustrating happens often the print quality good  make sure paper settings set correctly type paper using   print quietly easy operate  but overall i would recommend 
1,lasted six months  never worked exactly right since i purchased  i think software driver problems  would work sporadically  lock paper cleared manually  final straw  matter type paper fed  would catch feed path underneath print head apparent reason  of course paper still keeps trying feed  machine wads mess  in addition software driver problem  i think significant design problem paper feed often trys feed five six sheets  even hp desk jet paper designed printers  i say work  printed well 
2,myc lasted five years  ate paper drive mechanism yesterday the prints good  although color quality sometimes off hard complain came free mac  slow printer amulti color ink cartridge  somewhat expensive printer using individual cartridges always minor paper feeding glitches 
1,i spent   hrs   hr   phone hp trying install printer  it never would work right  the hp tech said problem software program printer  this hp deskjetc everyone s worst installation nightmare

2,despite great rating rave reviews  i curse day i brought home  i gone least ream paper three weeks i printer  i productive  paper jams often printer actually shreds paper tries eject  several cries help complaints hp customer service resulted   s common problem  the arm n t detract page  you manually reset arm whenever happens   so far  means   times day  no hp  this second bad experience  you would think i would learned 
2,i decided get new printer picture reproduction small business projects  the printer shredded  print jobs i sent  the roller jams paper back  forcing remove panel ripping sheet teeth monster  it like playing toy tug  if eat print jobs  sheet fed cockeyed prints kilter lucky sheet makes beast  i dissapointed week ownership
3,i vec couple years use work  i print documents day  mostly b  w  color also overall good printer job nicely  what printer lacks features makes ease use consistency  rarely i ever paper jam i s easy resolve 
3,i got old hp printer finally died  the quality good  extremely slow  took  hours print screenshot unreal  best quality  its possibly i m using parallel port  usb  as printer did not usb cable  also  never use the cancel button on it     it sends strange message comp  computer sends back printer tells print pages jibberish  also memory hog on your pc    i had to find something else to do for  hours   but must admit  quality excellent  on included sample photo quality paper  looks fantastic so buy printer  buy usb cable lot memory  also set max resoultion printing  requires mb  extra hard drive space so choice  if buy n t like  n t say n t warn  
5,i bought printer two weeks ago running within minutes unpacking  when i first bought pc i feared two commonly documented problems  paper jams printer driver problems os problems  date i experienced either quality good laser printers i use office  the thing i dislike printer high cost replacement cartridges i hoping someone deveolpe refill kit similiar i used old canon bjc  worked great  
3,this printer lasted  years  perfect prtints  ink hog  but bought cheaper ink caused ink drip drag paper rollers printer  so buy  make sure use hp ink  dont listen sales guy frys like

2,again  good product  priced  i would try find gently used ones 
3,i picked  autobahn holle   based reviews made sound like german ac dc perhaps  even better  megaherz   the album opens title track heiland  probably favorite  track meter aggression mid paced ac dc tune appears fast vigorous schweißer play  from track progressively little mellower previous  while i m sure album would appeal someone  seems like mellower would probably prefer something puhdys   looking something harder would prefer megaherz

2,mild sweeetness  though ultimately tastes like soap  something reminiscent soap 
3,the description says  mounting brackets   included applicable   evidently edelmann considers two mounting brackets line re useable  the oem brackets spot welded together  remove old line drill spot weld  i tried chisel separate halves  butchered bracket  being weekend mechanic i prepared re use brackets  i checked stores  none included bracket either  this hose assembly good quality  fit fine  price delivery great  i upset i unprepared knowledgeable remove re use existing brackets

4,the best example around asimov s work  it intellectual  interesting  plain entertaining  reading  feel danger fledgeling foundation threatened aggeressive neighbors unconventional solutions  i two complaints  the book dated little action  get past re sure enjoy book 
1,50 years future still smoking cigarettes  reading newspapers  main power source nuclear energy and carry nuclear guns    a kidnd grade imagination  i almost made  it gotten absurd finally drifted shelf   what i n t like  lack imagination  see    cardboard characters  nobody really cheer for either character pencil necked geek babbling fool   false religion mumbo jumbo  never would worked if most allthe priests new farce avoid unless need something stoke fire next winter 
1,this worst books ever picked  within fist pages  iwas bored mind  i n t know everyone think book sooooo good  n t listen  if like bad books  i hope asimov better books  cause acclaimed good writer something  book  
1,this book overrated books i ever read  there little way plot character development  there climax book  the book reads like historical record  similar tolkiens silmarillion  rather actual story  if like reading historical records  may like book  if looking exciting novel    better luck elsewhere 
2,asimov interesting concepts novel  it s unfortunate killed stale characters unbelievable plot devices  the book  successors  read like episode leave it beaver set outer space  the repetitive vault openings became tediously predictable  i felt like i read chapter dozen times  read cliff notes  save time    
2,the first time i tried read foundation  i six years old  simply complex developing mind  just months ago  however  i cleaning attic came across old book  to ascertain s actual nature interpreted adult mind  i read  i amazed sheer brillance ingenuity ideas contained within  grandiose size subject matter  mostly writing  i regarded absolutely horrid  the plot clunky  conversations roll tongue like sandpaper covered peanut butter  descriptions could written better obscure species mosquito  as book  could improved changing title  foundation    how not write book    please steal these ideas rewrite them english   i highly reccomend people use expensive ineffective paperweight 
3,the main reason i read sci fi visualize strange new worlds places  although good book  i n t really get good mental picture different worlds involved except trantor beginning book  it mostly people politics little landscapes lived  i guess i liked dune hyperion series much 
2,i heard much book years n t like asimov s writing i never read  well  i thought maybe different  s poor writing  i love idea psychohistory s love ends book  and hari seldon get know like  dull  mostly pointless conversations people n t know story jumps quickly time ruin book  and lazy asimov develop ideas  at point gets character watch movie n t see describes something would interesting clever developed i guess i ll finish series i ve heard books better  phew  glad i got way 
4,parts book i really enjoyed  i appreciate twists played characters another  i felt reading entire bit  though  enough actually taken place  i n t feel i walked away story i could remember  i read review  serious science fiction   mind  i still give five stars  i would liked pace quicker i really really enjoyedthe hitch hiker s guide galaxy  i would recommend book foundation  based personal taste 
4,this certainly excellent  first  book asimov series  even read  prelude foundation  pick right enjoy series  sets stage next books series  makes think   what would happen america lost power sources   
4,i started reading series original  foundation  disappointed  after acclaim received  i expecting something truly exceptional  instead  i got historical narrative closer style something would read brittanica school assignment  it really kind  mutant  novel documentary  what s  exceptionally boring  what kept going asimov cover hope better things  this say really bad book  i must confess interesting parts course  series whole absolute classic  every novel foundation series brilliant  cover disappointment  it must remembered asimov wrote book early s still young inexperienced writer
3,i like foundation s solid piece sci fi olden days   george lucas s stealing asimov s city planet coruscant  tsk tsk  georgie  amazed   foundation peculiarities  people hundreds thousands years future speak like us  they use phrases like us  they atomic technology peoples  asimov got bit lazy  could ve imagined something cooler nukes  the galaxy metaphor crumbling roman empire  perhaps terminus ireland  as a s style  i found use long adverbs rather funny  in sum  good book ignore stuff 
4,foundation great science fiction scientific minded  deus ex machina  the fault i findst book  main characters exactly person  seldon  salvor hardin hober mallow exact character  all calm  cool collected  perfectly confident perfectly logical  no difference dialogue problem solving skills  would n t able tell asimov s writing characters different time periods different cultures  for matter  every character book seems culture dialect  i realize asimov uses minimalist style writing  like hemmingway  good bad sides  no fleshing characters considered weakness asimov s writing  it may made longer book  characters would better served n t behave robots 
1,i huge fan science fiction fantasy  reading books years  i picked foundation books asimov supposed great  i really enjoyed short stories  this book  books series  amazingly boring could used replace thorazine  the concept solid  characters made  i kept hoping would simply would something interesting happening  if must read  check library save money  unless course re chronic insomniac   means  buy book 
3,re reading foundation showed rather dated depiction advanced galactic empire  rooteds science fiction environment  the overall plot   betrays novel s origins separate short stories  characters tend wooden  foundation empire  next book asimov s original foundation trilogy  much better novel  especially depiction character mule  however  concept psychohistory introduced work fascinating key books asimov others describing past future developments foundation universe 
4,a trilogy consists three books  even although  foundation   true classics  good enough trilogy  formally  foundation  needed two volumes make trilogy  in two volumes level fall badly  although  mule  rather weak unfortunately asimov  truly greats sf  later succumbed undue pressure combined robot series  already continued long  foundation  outright embarrassing results  the original three books quite enough  thank 
4,the start asimov s highly influential groundbreaking future history series  the invention science psychohistory captivated first time i read  basically  interest sf check out asimov s intro gives history evolution series editor  campbell  well entertaining silliness publisher doubleday  he tells would n t publish time  later  cap hand asking new book foundation  the psychohistorians  isaac asimovfoundation  the encyclopedists  isaac asimovfoundation  the mayors  isaac asimovfoundation  the traders  isaac asimovfoundation  the merchant princes  isaac asimovfuture prediction equations suggest galactic empire go bye bye  struggles seldon s legacy city split odd ship  commercial leading edge seldon crisis sellers heaps stuff  
4,i found politics novel interesting enough disregard dated scientific references  seldon science fascinating behold  plot masterful  what concerned  dare i say   fairly amateurish use dialogue tags fact character seemed pretty much speak voice  asimov wrote authors pains repeat he said   so must new tag time  matter ridiculous  often paired adverb makes cringe   spluttered angrily   cried sternly   mumbled grumpily     sad basic trick writing lets passages vivid description intriguing plot also  things seemed implausible   foundation  exported technology across galaxy  able keep technology secret  nonetheless  series every sci fi fan read  attributes outweigh faults fair margin 
2,i could n t wait read first foundation novels  got great reviews  heard s inspiration many sci fi authors  but i could barely finish  the book flat out boring  there action  choosing rather focus mostly matters political intrigue  if like watching cspan  ll love book there continuity storyline characters  the book constantly jumps ahead time right time ve wrapped head around current characters plot it s like set boring short stories  loosely stitched together single underlying theme 
2,this seems like awfully shoddy science fiction  the old complaint thin characterization n t even worst  crazy anachronisms  rampant cigar smoking  newspapers casual misogyny   but much plot develops form uninteresting local political maneuvers slightly aynrandized heroes buffooning villians  sense place grandeur whatsoever the timeline novel suddenly breif introducing vast concept year swing history  neither future society asimov envisioned apparant brilliance plan heart series ever portrayed convincingly  whatever powerful effect book may day  bereft 
1,  n t prevent intensely disliking  the characters flat  story contrived  people power world  very realistic idea future 
5,having finished greg bear s brilliant  foundation  chaos   i ve decided i longer wait begin re reading original  i wish i could next months start robot series  move galactic empire series  finsh entire collection foundation books  s big wunnerful story  doncha  know    well  year  perhaps  i may  in meantime  i re read  foundation  yet another new perspective hari seldon came original masterpiece   truly never gets old 
1,i read book teenager excited reminded recently  i went amazon purchase book find without text speech enabled i make policy buy book n t feature i prefer read i m stationary listen i m driving  since future n t yet i n t safely read i m driving  problem me listen publishers  i m going buy audio book  disabling feature ensures i ll buy ebook either  if i really read book  i ll find used copy ve annoyed much

1,count minority found book unreadable  it incredibly dated imagery thin sparse  i got lost pointless dialog unable finish 
1,i enjoy asmov s science books  they informative  clever witty  but science fiction another matter  they poorly written  and worse  i n t believe word foundation  such accutate prediction impossible  it s extremely difficult predict major trends  character predict minor details well absurd  just example difficulties prediction  isaac asimov  well informed intelligent  missed computer revolution  though already way wrote foundation 
1,this rated books  series  time the dialog character development horrible  the characters much depth paper dolls  the language colorful newspaper the ideas behind novel may new interesting years ago   although anyone familar wells  huxley  verne would debate   tired beaten like dead horse 
3,isaac asimov greatest science fiction minds twentieth century  he not  however  great writer  at times difficult separate brilliance scope imaginative ideas pedestrian awkward manner presents   foundation   first novel ever lengthening foundation series  collection short stories originally published  astounding  magazine  the first couple good  last pretty uninteresting  the writing uneven  dialogue unrealistic  characters wooden one dimensional  and yet  asimov s wonderfully creative idea psychohistory use saving dying galactic empire  series became best science fiction stories time  well worth reading do careful edition read  i read del ray paperback edition  i never seen many typographical errors published book 
5,the set arrived time enjoyed listening tapes  tapes arrived good condition great sound 
5,great book isaac asimov  what wonderful sci book  i d recommend series anyone likes fiction
5,not earth shaking intensely mind bending even years i enjoyed rereading series  asimov s storytelling great 
5,asimov founding fathers sci fi owe debt gratitude making genre worthy literary title  his messages considerations give reader lot something kill time  it makes sci fi avenue real soul searching 
5,any coment s serie books must positive s thats becouse dident understand story  reread  stronly recommend serie books anyone  sci fans  taste read  the author serie wrote books  genius died time age  memory isaac asimov recommend books  especially foundation series  thaks reading review 
5,i highly recommend time read  foundation    may convince continue rest series  i believe forerunner main idea behind concept galactic empire expanded star wars star trek  if would like see genesis idea behind phenomena ll much rewarded reading foundation series   besides  anything asimov worth weight gold zenith space operatic writings 
5,the book n t really need yet another enthusiastic review  i ll keep point the stories book really enjoyable  you get learn characters beginning spend rest time reading legacy created later events hand shaping  i find satisfying way similar dune series i n t read  books as every asimov book i ve read  plots book forged hewn complicated machines disassembled eyes right climactic moment  it makes hard book put 
2,just writing provide support anyone reads book thoroughly underwhelmed asimov s prose clean tone seems uneven installment  opposed tighter first book the book essentially two disconnected adventures   appealing there s female character second adventure s quite problematic  s dull  asimov spends lot time effort fact s  gasp  male finally  series feels dated  terms language  attitudes  even vision future   nuclear  buzzword  everything s likes  nuclear powered i liked foundation foundation  empire tends wander away idea foundation main character  instead n t seem decide whether focus galactic level events protagonists  this would excusable protagonists interesting go read jack vance gene wolfe masterful sci fi 
1,i ordered book  weeks ago came today  what s worse  s absolutely terrible shape  the front cover ripped  spine old sticker residue  back looks like s chewed small animal  so much  used very good condition  
4,i enjoyed foundation  the book divided  parts  the interesting rd  the expected  the  parts overall particularly conected opinion  but book good 
3,foundation enjooyable book ever read  my biggest compalaint time gap big  i think book went long time  one mintue planet charecters next chapter everone dead years
2,this book asimovian trademarks  intriguing ideas marred utterly forgettable indeed interchangeable characters  cringe inducing dialogue  plodding storytelling style pace  later career asimov fixed problems somewhat  point young present full force  the unfortunate truth book simply n t deserve praise heaped upon  s kind herd mentality leads many people venerating foundation  if seriously science fiction  means read entire foundation series  historical importance enjoyment  but i hate think people introduced science fiction book 
3,let s  isaac asimov good writer  especially early game  we read foundation  interested reading fantastic literature ideas little book became tropes thrived science fiction even day  if re interested sci fi  foundation  must read the importance foundation  genre may force us allow blandness prose  however  excuse  the characters ciphers  style blunt ugly  like sledgehammer  plenty minor annoying infelicities grammar  it s good thing novel pleasantly short  whatever asimov s faults  long windedness 
3,i read book teenager  loved  read several years later  could understand i liked  sure  asimov writes ease  equally easy read  but characters totally flat  plot    thoroughly predictable  shows terrible amount prejudice women  minority people anything fit template  middle age white american male   the book generally left bad taste  d stuffed marshmallows  mostly air enough sugar make feel sick 
3,previous reviewers hit main gripes  character development insights  predictable plot development  women  understand written series shorts  really political drama played space  could easily set earth  interesting moments  far gripping i much preferred early heinlein  clarke  later ellison  pangborn  farmer  pohl  cordwainer smith  al dont think ll bother rest series 
2,i respect asimov writer science fiction  however reading foundation series i wish humanity  the book overly complex  the characters nothing  the foundation series rated humble opinion  it falls category i call dry sci fi  asimov s robot series better 
3,three stars bit generous  certainly n t bad book  in fact  easy read  always interesting  often exciting  but s  it deep meaingful  it profoud  it thought provoking  it n t even particularly well written  but s easy enough good qualities n t disliked the plot center s around creation foundation  place mankind s accumulated knowledge protected approaching collapse civilization  this interesting enough premise original day  blending mathematics psychology science accurately predict much future hard seriously if across copy book  read  it n t long ll probably enjoy much even sf fan  i n t recommend anyone book  there much much much better 
4,the foundation setup secretly monitor mankind darkest hours  it reminded little orwell s  in placing humans away central government planet resources  they forced develop quickly  this novel political machinations action  the contradictions human nature analyze  the characters use guile  spirit   cunning survive  some  book dialogue  character development bit shallow  nonetheless  mr asimov portrays future poignant  diverse ways  the predicted conflict makes story galactic history entertaining  especially since written  some  years sputnik launched  the author deserves praise imagination well ahead time 
5,i admit  i asimov phile  this yet another book asimov hard put  i rate  asimovs books highest regard  quite simply buy  fool    
4,this book highly cereberal study history  i lot action look somewhere else   i suggest david drake s m  sterling  if something ponder book  asimov s ideas borrowed works seem new  the science somewhat dated  nucleur light bulbs economical transmutation   this book give excellent veiw forces history  if understand causes nations fall read book  just n t expect star wars style entertaiment 
3,first  i read quite bit genres  primarily expand world  foundation good series  s reasons book might expand your world   statistics religion philosophy major college  may annoy     book entertainment  ponder  may bore     really think character development important book  spans generations  hence little no development     you re already scifi buff  books ve read already assimilated ideas foundation  credit due    biggest reason read  robust  well crafted universe  other tidbits  i ve tried read series second time  n t sustain interest quite like  star selections 
5,i always liked asimov  finding series books sequence difficult print books  kindle makes easy  now re cataloged order i n t even get bed next one reading  foundation  series order rather availability makes great writer even better 
3,foundation completely story ideas  characters completely servants scifi galaxy asimov created  the story galaxy situation character situation  i think idea created amazing i prefer stories characters originally wrote stories magazine later combined destroyed flow storyrich
3,i expecting much book awarded best sci fi series ever  it good  great  maybe s best sci fi  compared today s standards little boring date  it contains long dialogs lot politics wrapped sci fi environment  it n t contain fascinating worlds interesting glimpses future  there s lot action i admit dialog pretty good  if re nostalgia  politics interesting dialog book 
5,i read almost asimov s fiction  book far best  i would recommend anyone interested  boom  done jeremy paul gallagher
5,this book simply best science fiction stories ever written  it  must read  list sci fi fan 
2,prelude foundation excellent  however  stop  foundation bad  this book totally predictable  read dune something intelligent entertaining  read foundation something probably n t even finish 
5,what i say    asimov best  it s impossible stop reading book  the chapters incredible  n t wait get finish know plot ends  if n t read  n t know missing
5,foundation called science fiction lovers world cornerstone science fiction  isaac asimov s time best  book tells crumbling galactic empire beggining  book series  the way asimov uses analogy fall roman empire pleased readers decades  asimov tells story planet alone edge galaxy awaiting future already planned  leaders struggle planets survival  planet  terminus  holds future human race hands  isaac asimov tells thrilling human survival environment 
3,foundation empire basically continuation foundation  there really n t new plot  new problems foundation deal  foundation empire pretty good  without novelty new ideas presented foundation  bit flat  about reason i could think recommend book see else happens seldon s colony 
1,the book apparently resent arriving  weeks ordering still hasnt arrived two months  phshopus customer service responsive something going wrong shipment process
4,if series seems little dated naive  try cut back read  i appreciated imaginative leaps  well way whole series observes discipline genre  make fundamental alteration science know  see thread leads 
5,i remember walking library thirteen year old back pack  smile foundation books  now  i read  times  difference i walks library 
4,it interesting concept  bit heavy scientific version  fate   this series books uses concept random motion prediction future quite brilliant idea  the story deals genius predicts behavior millenia future actually recorded holograms future people deal predictions  where i trouble reliance robots later books  i personally prefer human side things  it interesting read well worth 
3,in initial read book  i stuck classic everyone loves  however  half book i got bored  nothing seemed building catching  i stopped  i restarted interested i know background story  so far  second trip book much enjoyable first slow trip 
2,i got pretty bogged multiple characters places time periods  not good book pick occasionally  takes focussed reading  and s series 
3,i read this presents galaxy without aliens  colonized people  it soft sf many ways  incl  ftl  antigravity  flying cars  walnut sized nuclear reactors  laser pistols  personal city force shields  egregious use energy form anti gravity elevators  psychohistorian predicts future events to the day plot dumb  mention idea civilizations ftl ships incapable harnessing nuclear power  with repeated suspensions disbelief  pleasant enough  the characters nitwits  prelude fdn   no need read books   reading if universe teeming aliens   where everybody   fifty solutions fermi paradox problem extraterrestrial life   stephen webb
2,i realize i m minority compared reviews i n t feel book even close half good first foundation book  the two stories lacked charters i cared unlike first foundation book little contemplate  also i guessed big twist second story third page 
3,this may classic i may science fiction fan  read asimov s  the gods themselves  instead  his later work definitely better   foundation empire  like predecessor   foundation   get several stories told different periods throughout foundation history  everything asimov books fundamentally good sci fi story stuff  lack character development makes think re reading   why i reading   i ll read last trilogy   second foundation     s far i m going go these for great sci fi  read  hyperion     fall hyperion     ender s game     childhood s end      a space odyssey     do androids dream electric sheep   for good sci fi  read  more than human     the gods themselves     slan     the demolished man     the stars my destination   too much to list  my friends    good luck good reading 
4,in twisted   reading foundation series  japanese terrorist cult aum shinrikyo used asimov s epic prophecy upcoming apocalypse converted dimsighted guru dictator shoko ashara incarnation hari seldon  worthwhile sharpen wits read story see zealots got wrong  could easily pervert asimov s points   see david kaplan andrew marshall s book   the cult end world    
4,i always enjoy reading isaac asimov s writing  foundation exception  the plot imaginative original  like much asimov s writing  foundation set future  time galaxy ruled failing empire  hari seldon  psychologist  must prevent galaxy falling anarchy barbarism creating foundation scientists  foundation fun read  provides ample entertainment  i recommend reading 
2,it n t kind book  i thought  i would give try  we read book club  some readers liked  n t  i n t  but  author great insight future  s
1,  to surprise disappointment  i found  foundation  exceptionally terrible  book   totally undeserving praise received  as reviewers pointed  writing style poor quality indeed  it dull dry  totally lacking kind style art  the dialogue simply dreadful  character development nonexistent  story pointless well structured  the fact alleged  novel  really collection short stories readily apparent  cohesion poor correlation sections  this memorable writing way redeeming qualities work literature  in fact  time i ever like mention example poor writing  atrocious story telling  science fiction totally wanting kind inspiration   
1,i recently read called masterpiece  i even went far order special complete edition science fiction book club  even though i got i believe outstanding reviews awards series received  no characters  science  mystery  coul n t figure identitiy mule    in addition story basically collapse roman empire  it probably could rewritten replacing historical language instead spacefare would mattered slightest  the science fictional element psychohistory developed due nature plot  if classic  i shall stick obscure worthwhile reads  blech

3,a little flimsier i thought would bigger  i took chance buy online   cheap enough n t matter i looking  save another project later
1,the movie started poorly went hill  i waiting get better realized minutes going get worse  stopped minutes  i could waste time movie  if read reviews watching movie many bad reviews  n t watch 
1,movie boring  wonder never heard  bad bomb  long boring
1,bad acting  bad camera work  bad editing  bad story line  sigh  being native new orleanian  i great hope movie  but waist time watch 
4,because people seems willing two hours watching nicholas cage play drug addicted detective  hoping somehow reform find solution twist fate bring conclusion hopeless life  and script excellent  denied pleasure justice  forced watch find pleasure totally destructive  the script constantly draws taking position subject matter  either accepting person s behavior  actions   accepting  rejecting movie altogether  i would recommend children watch movie adult supervision  nicholas cage movie role model follow 
5,imagine dirty harry bad coke habit  played nicolas cage new orleans  cage gives us outstanding performance someone goes though violent coke induced mood swings  the iguana appears movie time time symbolic metaphor  monkey back   cage investigating brutal family execution interweaves personal failings process  his girlfriend prostitute protects supplies drugs  he gambling habit  owes money  bets much lsu  course steals evidence locker  he shakes people information  even grandmothers  makes dirty harry look like sissy  lots use  bad language  sexual situations  violence  good story  plot fairly simple follow  the movie  time  feel dark comedy 
2,i usually like nicolas cages  work  he s fine actor  however  acting could n t save rather stupid film cast addicted detective post katrina new orleans  no doubt complicated life  his girlfriend prostitute  father recovering alcoholic father s wife likes drink whole lot beer  his world addiction corruption s single character sense likable  to top  boring i fell asleep  definitely recommended 
2,alright  movie boring  i watched hoping would get better n t  i lot high hopes movie based reviews i read watching  yes  nick cage good job eva always beautiful pretty much highlight movie 
2,i found movie pathetic times  the use plot line  times  absurd  i wish i n t wasted  renting b c n t worth  the director s failed attempts  artsy  alligator  iguanas like obvious remedial action david lynchy lost practically anyone except perhaps director as may surmise  n t permanent library 
2,if watch  better option rent  it nothing original  it stands  between coke takings iguanas alligators  s enough punch make film emerges great film bought re watch book  there lot potentials  director takes easy way already thin plot  nicholas cage ok  bad fairuza balk  scenes  eva mendes val kilmer s talents wasted  just everage promising start might be an awesome film  just ok  memorable 
1,could n t watch minutes  the acting  plot  everything   completely   bad  why people enjoy movie 
1,this plain bad  boring    i find least bit entertaining interesting  it waste time 
1,i tried giving movie chance   watched way thru   even though i going shut multiple times   probably worst movie i ve watched ever  
3,i really enjoyed watching nicolas cage develop character lead  i felt director rushed things first  n t get see enough makes officer tick beginning film  once premise film set  however  interesting interplay  good cop    bad cop  well worth time spent watching movie  the overall plot predictable  enjoy watching cage play yet another wall specimen 
1,believe i watched whole movie  i kept hoping could get better  never get better  worse
1,horrible movie  worst i ever seen  nick cage s career definitely n t piece garbage 
1,i say  worst nic cage movie i ever seen  the director horrible  looks like cheap movie waste time  and val kilmer  dude  lose weight  make start working seeing  he looked best top gun  ever since movie  batman  let go  i trying judge  used nice look   do n t waste your time  i glad free thru prime  thank goodness 
1,go break open red light camera steal film  watch  it times better acting much coherent plot 
2,service good movie  came quickly timely mode  movie sucked  started good  middle  lost appeal  bad lieutenant  n t catch keep eye  towards end  like  going on  changed completely beginning n cage good actor  eva  really n t plot  
1,this worst movies i seen long time  i usually enjoy nicholas cage movies far beneath i n t imagine would even 
1,what terrible movie  garbage  it totally sucks  what hollywood coming  it seems running stories make movies  what garbage  good lord  right boondock saints  smokin aces   
1,there one redeemable quality film  period  nicolas cage bottom barrel  he absolutely no range  the acting worse low budget b movie  i think seriously something  so new orleans post katrina  nic supposed tough guy gets kinds trouble  i could n t figure coming going  i baffled entire movie  the lines horrible  please save your money 
1,i like nicolas cage  movie waste time bad story  crappy acting   do n t waste time garbage 
3,not overly engaging  entertaining quite disturbing look downward spiral good cop  this movie must influenced sense bad lieutenant entire film reminiscent film  softened allow viewer like main character instead wishing horrible things happen  
5,arguably werner herzog s best films  cage packs punch intense acting  of course s edgy everyone well pushes limits traditional film making  get tranced extra long shots wildlife music trips though you were drugs  daze  quirky humor  crazed rants breaking rules wreckless focused effective way  i m watch movies  seen least three times 
4,he good actor  plot  make good movie 
4,i enjoyed  get see n cage role wallow manic phase shtick   wonderful diversion typical film normalacy  he starts living nightmare  somehow dives deeper deeper overwhelming whirlpool desperation threat  it takes place new orleans  city dissipation career  during lowest part cage s crash dive  herzog includes bizarre shots alligators iguanas  disconcerting  interesting visual evocative mindset moment  this film mesmerizing ride hell  cage perfect conductor  there light  preventing film existing compleat downer 
3,1  glorifies drugs corruption  maybe s no  gets old seeing cage act bad criminals pursues   why cage sound like wad chaw gum mouth middle part movie    it n t bad n t good  i guess s get free amazon prime  least added couple new movies finally 
1,begs comparisons keitel s original fails every level  it never creates sympathy gritty immoral world cardboard cutout inhabits  it s easily cage s worst performance time worst use music drama ever  unlike steel keitel  clown would overdosed shot times  any rookie cop could point dozen giant plot holes 
2,so s dirty cop around horrible person  spoiler   everything worked  what heck point movie  seriously   everything worked  i n t know i continued watch 
1,save your money    this movie goes show nicolas cage val kilmer definitely washed actors  i wish i could get money time back movie  i put eyes cordless drill thinking much i watched trash turning 
1,words describe movie  say movie sucks awful 
1,this worst movies i ve seen long long time  the plot unimaginative  active plain horrible there n t much say 
1,even cage  genius acting parts  could n t save bad movie one wosre movies i ever watched why keep hiring eva mendes  acts like piece wood 
2,how collection letters make print   scores personalities whose letters i d love read collection n t  these letters boring write many notable people  mccartney  lennon olivier   before read theater critic  read william goldman said legendary book broadway the season  chapter titled  the approvers   that tells theater critics need know  then decide whether read tynan s letters  i n t think book would made print tynan s wife n t shoving publisher s editor s throats  dull  dull  dull  except five letters

3, s good eye opener  least s good enough make think twice following instructions   anyone 
2,this book really dry   couple interesting moments book lot unnecessary words  this books i n t finish 
1,when written  books topic well known  individuals styles communication well understood with time  people places con price refers familiar local individuals and important regards fund knowledge i currently working dr william thackery msu northern  havre  montana upgrade update book subscript text improved reading  relevance  accuracy  once done text may leading contribution history montana southern alberta yours  ruth m burleigh p o box chinook  montana  
1,i loved i first started using recommended everyone  limited use  totally shot  either keys n t respond pressed key  multiple letters appeared     became      q  became  qw   impossible return  one friend purchased exactly problem within month  n t bad unit if i coud give no stars  i would 
3,i bought gift  it useful  fact waterproof handy  the keys little hard get used  s rather cheaply made 
4,with dialogue like  not movie  crisp  cool dialogue  minimal plot   action performances halsey lambert taking honours  the violence bloodless  though brutal  perhaps budgetary restraints prevented mr pyun spending blood squibs   reminded miami vice   gunplay  blood   i d love see re made john woo directing  bloodless violence aside  takes edge movie  thing lets dvd congenital cretins tri mark seen fit infinite wisdom present full frame picture rather  aspect ratio  the picture quality disc suffers abominably zoomed full frame  action becomes confusing  cropping sides blatantly obvuious  come trimark  let s widescreen re release  one pyun s better efforts  nemesis 
2,christopher lambert ice t supposed stars  little depth movie comes michael halsey  turns professional killer sympathetic figure  anyone earn sympathy bit video treacle achievement  if re big fan bloodless  mindless gunplay  reason buy movie soundtrack  mambo fans actually enoy  well andean flute guitar instrumental 
2,i ve seen film mean guns twice i even purchased dvd  albeit bargain rack   this n t great film  n t even really good film  entertaining like violence mambo the story behind movie weak best cast  consisting mostly ice t christopher lambert  really n t much improve film  there interesting action moments  beat mambo music if find cheap price i d suggest  i would n t pay couple bucks film  of course re diehard christopher lambert fan really love mambo violence  might something invest 
4,main reason waited  morning cause fan chris lambert saw id say excellent action acting done chris lambert ice t great action and i was dissapionted christopher lambert told marcus killed daughter didnt killed ugly old woman even act probably old enough look like shes mabye is so entaining worth watch 
1,i disappointed book  i found shop set effecient layout dust collection important aspects woodworking  i always looking new innovative ways effecient effective areas  i could find difference book earlier version replaces  even photos outdated photos appear taken late s used release  please  taunton  n t insult readers continuing regurgitate information shiny new label attempt sell books  please strive produce new relevant photos information  your books magazines already expensive  would nice quality matched 
2,lots great ideas unlimited budgets  many suggestions within economic means thinking setting shop  although author includes many photo s  dream  shop  most references tools include equipment costs  s     lot s fluff author plentiful color photos shop layouts  tools  equipment average  joe  would spend decades purchasing  not much  practical  information  the practical guide designing building your dream shop   definately dream 
5,do n t know anyone else addresed  i building barn shop  years  the book covers many thoughts concerns  would wanted sooner later  points raised consideration  noise sound  i put wood walls  painted white sealed moisture  i fussed drywall  i considered sound issues went wood  but reading author s comments i spending extra time fire protection sound absorption i parts shop  not alone  nieghbors well  good book read  contemplating shop  hey  get find masters wood roughed well 
3,i found better books i ve seen setting shop  it showcases plenty example shops handy advise  however  like books topic  tries cover possibilites  building separate shop  working shed  basement  attic etc  pertinent information case thus sparse  i d like see books specifically conversion basement space shed etc  shop  i guess would add limitations readership writer publisher perspective 
5,as library administrator  avid woodworker  i get see read lot woodworking shop building books  this among best i ever read  i even purchased copy  i really impressed common sense advice day to day problems encountered workshop  many workshop books market either simplistic  serve showcase famous woodworking shops without detail  this book gives nitty gritty need set rework dream shop  it definitely helped 
1,the best thing i found book picture cover  well  actually uncropped version chapter   beyond  i found everything else non practical design perspective  a photo filthy dust collector area discussing advantages central collection electrical wiring would never pass inspection typical  i d rather see plan views real shops work reasons decisions made 
4,we great time watching virtual tour chile s wine regions  the dvd narrated english  gives good tips interesting information history wine industry develop chile 
4,it took get cd  though i often admire bill laswell  sessions produces often terribly uneven  except sharrock s ask ages basically lets music talking   the title track starts  ambient  percussion section makes say  laswell genius   this followed  afro pop  song rap makes say  laswell mess everything   the problem today  everybody thinks fill whole cd music  try programing disc without  smooth jazz  midnight berkely title track i believe find could pharoah s best album still clocks minutes 
1,this record discusted  mr sanders ought think less money quality music  i mean  played coltrane obviously n t get  dont buy cd  popular music worst sense  instead buy record john coltrane  in latet period themes sanders shows doesnt necessarily lead kitsch 
5,there way anyone truly say study train ninjutsu without reading stephen hayes  material  he probably reason ninjutsu accessable masses  his work dedication art without fringe kook wacko give highest level credibility  this good stuff  his master  masaaki hatsumi still alive japan  there secrets  verifiable truth waiting discovered  if knowledge ninjutsu ninjitsu ninpo etc  complete  buy books 
5,this ultimate action movie still years i really enjoy watching film  max fight crazy motorbikers supercharger v car futuristic landscape  he give mercy bad boys killed family 
5,i first saw movie theatre  i purchased vhs version dvd version soon came  since i searching australian soundtrack version avail  when i read mad max website australian version available  i bought immediately  man i blown away  this favorite movies  now favorite  how could released movie overdub insane  it s like watching brand new movie  definitely worth price admission  oh comparison movie s sequels  road warrior okay thunderdome joke turkey 
2,there doubt cult classic  plenty reason stay way  overall  predictable somewhat lacking screen presence  i n t really put finger makes film worth purchase  i admit interesting example australian movie making s the story line somewhat disturbed significant reasons allow children watch  really  little reason suggest anyone completely bored avenues moviemaking watch either 
4,i like turtles  and mad max  excellent movie  i like much  i love  and bad guy good farscape 
4,  mad max  made low budget  k k according various sources   dubbing editing make film seem cheap times  photography music big budget quality  the chases provide lots thrills  wait ll see trailer burst    director george miller provides brilliant imagery  max s feverish search last bikers unforgettable set piece  
3,this excellent example mel gibson s fine acting work  if n t seen  seen beyond thunderdome  give viewing  unfortunatly i purchased dvd version released  it n t special features  you stuck american voices dubbed austrailian actor s  this quite funny i wish i option see original aussie tape americanized version disk 
2,prospective purchasers note dvd dubbed version american actors replace australian actors soundtrack  i understand decision overdub part done movie first released us  australian friend recalled shock dubbing saw us cinema time  i would thought studio could dug original australian version released instead  because irritating pointless feature otherwise fine movie  best mad max series   i rate dvd  stars 
1,do n t buy video  with dvd technology would no brainer provide sound tracks  original aussie version rotten american dubbed version  these dopes chose give us nobody wants  perhaps nobody buys ll get clue 
3,i m really sure  least favorite mad max trilogy  it s nearly awesome road warrior fun beyond thunderdome  either way  s worth watching simply sets scene road warrior  greatest movies time 
4,a catalyst contemporary era revenge actioner movement  george miller flick features young  then unknown mel gibson second movie role  top cop max rockatansky  after pursuit max s ends fiery crash  killing pursued  biker named nightrider   targeted motor terrorists death fellow gang member  when max goes vacation trip wife infant  attacked malicious  vengeful mob  leaving max childless widower hungry violent revenge   s exactly gets  set post apocalyptic australia  film  made meager   held highest cost profit ratio film hollywood history  blair witch surpassed mark 
2,this dvd u s release  original australian dialog  including mel gibson s  replaced dubbed dialog  american english   
3,this film prequel amazingly good  the road warrior   i ve read  mad max  highest return investment film ever made  k make  m revenue generated   however  upon watching movie  immediately struck low budget look feel  if ve already watched  the road warrior   may watch see rw roots  really need watch rw first  leonard maltin  rw review  states mad max least good rw  crazy  mm great movie made k  rw great movie  period  one thing  film dubbed american voices someone  infinite wisdom  thought americans would n t able understand australian accents  this big mistake  american voice actors invariably overacted dubbing 
2,i thought movie boring n t let get know characters  the good thing movie young  cute mel gibson 
3,normally i would say first trilogy bestbut mad max exception in fact mad max i think worst three the road warrior much better movie 
4,this film set standard post apocalyptic violence   almost along line kubric s clockwork orange  the movie unforgettable launched mel gibson lime light  with low budget managed unique movie captivating horrific  many tried cash copying movie  failed capture orignal spirit   the road warrior decent sequel much higher budget   it would recieve  stars  middle section movie bit sappy   dubbing australian accents mistake 
4,after watching mad max i n t really know say  i mean acting pretty bad  action great  n t really much plot good characters tried describe plot it cool see mel gibson first staring role this movie s fun 
4,mad max special edition must reason  the original australian language soundtrack  they released movie original language not english dubbed 
3,i give movie   stars  the road warrior  part    much better  i auto mechanic car buff  i particulary love car scenes movie  especially max s black ford falcon interceptor  even though blower engine fake  still love car max wipes motorcycle gang  this good movie  make sure get original version  voices n t dubbed 
5,in near furture  high ways tomorrow longer safe place  gangs bikers kamikaze lunatics roam long stretches road populate stretch land known austrailian outback  mel gibson soars tough futuristic cop mad max extreme action thriller started  amazing non computerized stunts make movie treat watch  after wife brutally murdered evil group bikers  max sets crazed revenge  earning heading  mad   grinding action sequences gibson s cool headed attitude make han solo look like second hand trash  just like star wars sci fi  movie revolutionized action movies time  setting standard today 
3,like mel gibson i like movie i n t see big changes i expected  maybe i missed something  it happens 
4,the australian dialog dubbed believed director aussie dialog would n t understood american audiences  this far best trilolgy  the leader motorcycle gang absolutely frightening  i think dubbing orchestrated soundtrack actually adds alien  feel movie  we watching cultural shock anything goes  keeps edge throughout movie  four stars only n t include original australian dialog  the sequels wannabes n t deserve single star 
1,i would n t waste single red cent anything jew hating  racist  woman abuser acts in this guy complete utter psychopath 
1,it unfortunate film ever dubbed  it though aussies speak another language yanks n t intelligent enough work careful crafted slang classic fortunate new undubbed version due release mouth  features cheaper i m selling old dubbed copy buying new undubbed version 
1,i huge mad max fan  i found copy i really happy  s hard find store  i waited get delivered sat partner watch  i disappointed finished cut half original movie    majority major scenes seen   i must admit first time i let amazon  classic movie  correct rating  reason cut soooooo much  person may seen  would real idea movie   
4,this film give never thought much australian films either fuel fire wake call this classic i suppose would call cult film  full intense performances whilst science fiction  otherwordly quality forget mel gibson  watch film brand drama  revenge  thrills  action good old fashioned mean heartedness if think  plot film recycled gladiator   another breakthrough film actor aussie part world buy enjoy distinctive film dvd  healthy worthwhile dose extras 
4,if know starred young mel gibson  would never believed really  this movie really good revenge movie  the problem i trying make said  it done  australian language   though basically english  accents except mel gibson s character strong really over listen try figure said  other  movie good movie crash scenes fantastic made  i wish i could understood everyone saying without straining order get even half dialogue  but  movie well worth viewing 
3,this movie almost classic  deserved moro complete edition second disk full extras 
3,it supposed post apocalypses story really things like roads  very narrow story line  in like mel gibson movies based revenge  boooorrrring    
4,anyone intelligent enough  get  movie capable understanding austrailian version  we moved beyond need americanizing films  tend water down original intent flavor director creators vision  this movie   relevent today filmed  in part america  especially small town rural areas  almost get feeling living future  many people midwest scrounge save meager earnings able afford fill gas tanks drive jobsite  the desolation area movie filmed makes movie eerily believable i often reminded look feel film driving small midwest american  ghost towns   in spite realism motion picture still high escapism  point watching movies  i ll watch 
3,mad max n t bad movie  it really lot better third installment trilogy  not classic like  the road warrior   still holds s  it s quite different two  you get see max lost everything  became way later  not bad 
4,i saw movie kid loved  i still like adult  dubbed dialogue takes alot away  hearing original aussie accents new dimension  very cool 
4,yeah  i m gon post contrast others said  this dvd include original aussie soundtrack  first time americans ever seen version history film  pretty impressive  it much better dubbed version  the special features so so  whole lot rave  the print clean  looks great widescreen  original audio definite plus  this certainly worthy purchase ten dollars 
5,a true action movie mel gibson  vigilante  death wife mad bikers  truly masterpiece 
1,i replaced amber bulbs turn signals ones  my car clear lenses unfortunately bulbs bright look reddish  like washed  n t enough red coating look red i looking something look color stop lights  bulbs n t 
1,sold red  obviously but i find pink dark red  i m sure re still legal  hope   look i hoping  expecting otherwise  work fine 
2,well iu thin book ve first book  its confusing boring long i like           
1,the childhood legendary kingthe king arthur s youth enthralling  the sword stone explains king arthur s youth throughout book  his wart book  from adventures takes legends queens learning experiences animals  n t put down what makes book unique warts learning experience  he changes four animals turns invisible merlin  warts tutor  the adventures goes amazing  he goes giants castle goes morgan fay s castle rescue friar tuck  coming fight big bird lion things  the book real conflicts i n t really like reading  book interesting  if like fantasies would like book  the reason changes different animals  turns invisible  fights monsters  it readers  
5,this book i read child loved  read loved  it part i see king arthur legend  i never part copy  i read i 
3,this interesting little book  i read part children s literature course back  the book partially arthurian legend  part social commentary part farce i like inappropriate references time story  trains  buses   as well i n t appreciate mixing robin hood  wood th century arthurth century yet fun book  easy read 
3,the ring is beautiful but thin  for special occassions only  i left it in my purse and it got pancaked before i was able to wear it  i was able to fix it as much as i could but the shape is distorted  very nice otherwise  also it runs a little small  i wear a loose  and this ring is snug
4,i found cd shelf work  i m listening right  sweet instrumentals make dance around  it reminds sugarplum fairies creating music s  the sound light  the lyrics album n t lyrics  it s rhythm creates  it s pleasant album 
4,ever albums  an album spin times songs might sink in  majority seem wrapped gauze  then  one day  hits  genius behind songs  hidden melodies  amazing musicianship  that experience album  it took  years   sporadic listenings suddenly hit head flat out amazing album  a songs easy accessible  ie   captain easychord    others may listens really appreciate    s worth effort   comparison  i found  margerine eclipse  easy get into  took  dots  loops    cobra  phases  really sink in  very highly recommended  hits  stay grow stronger repeat listens 
2,i going disagree reviews posted  this best stereolab offer  the first stereolab records i heard dots  loops cobra phase   i absolutely blown away albums  i could n t get excited though  the songs kind lifeless  interested ideas  never really get anywhere  it stereolab sound without bounce interplay instruments  i would recommend dots  loops  days week twice sunday
3,i wanted love album  really  from opening notes  black ants sound dust   i appreciated cleverness    time  whole tone scale  bells  cool   spacemoth  excited aural taste buds  even entire second half total ripoff velvet underground s  sunday morning   by  captain easychord   however  album beginning tire  even section sounded like could megaman  made ears tingle  only  hallucinex  worthy infinite replay value  opinion  each song album sounds great  together  album bores 
4,i deeply enjoyed hoover novels available kindle   the moghul    carribee   this offering   the samurai strategy   suffers little comparison  unlike hoover works  effort written set lates earlys  the dated setting slightly detracts book today s world  the subject matter still holds well aftermath wall st s latest shennagans  readers might get lost thick financial terminology  well written edited  good book spark thought america s current financial industrial situation 
2,hoover s choice international financial manipulation subject matter novel timely raised expectations  instead story pulpy romance surrounding contrived conflict japanese investors scheming revive imperial japan american regulators intent saving free world  the thing missing  b  grade movie plot black white hats differentiate bad guys good guys  not i hoped 
4,i thoroughly enjoyed reading well written  absorbing  researched story international financial espionage potential opportunities base less currency global financial world offered internet 
4,well  everyone  movie pretty good  there hysterical moments like murray trying turn mean guy rabbit instead turns rabbi  or bad fairy  played kathleen turner  turns head fairy paper thin stuffs mouth bricks  however  i think mara wilson better movies  also  gullible  watch movie  some parts believable  parts totally unrealistic  but s really good 
2,i really film  though  funny moments  lot attempts humor fell flat  i really like martin short  n t think funny  it little corny  i thought going musical  little singing  i disappointed  i n t like behind plot  wish  getting little girls dad role play  using means sabbotage character role  i n t think s good message kids  even methods used done fairy godmothers  i know lot shows  like bruce almighty  even show  gave newscaster s job back character stole  i would n t recommend movie anyone 
5,this movie little girl matilda martin short  good family picture  loved  came excellent condition 
3,my children seen movie several years ago remembered liking  we purchased surpirsed lame  perhaps made small children older kids adults find acting bad story silly enjoy 
3,mara wilson back playing chartacters mrs doubtfire turned fairy godmother believer  when  ironicly gets boy fairy godmother  played martin short   she needs wish  dad wanting show life audition  all daughter needs wish  wish  wish maybe maybe true  are believer  i actually bought video i kind disappointed bits  i still watch regulary though  funny fun flick watch 
3,it greatest movie i ve ever seen life  there much magic really puts together good movie i rented i ve seen two times i still think best movie i ve ever seen life
3,while harry pidgeon s feat sailing around world exceptional  writing style clear concise  offers insights sailing life  the book fashioned joshua slocum s  sailing alone around the world   or equally likely  pidgeon slocum two like mind  in event  portrayth century reserve characteristic englishmen  such reserve near scrapes death maybe admirable  make interesting reading 
4,this rattle easy hold added advantage able roll around floor  this makes grandson crawl  it s well made  makes nice rattling sound  i would buy grandson quite nice  he n t show interest  months plays bit  the negative comment i loses interest short time 
3,it good fried   i would recommend tho first check refunds return sellers fry s used 
4,with tool keep mini blinds really clean  brush reaches impossible crevices  and i dust blinds regular basis keep looking really great  i pleased product  especially since saves extra steps cleaning  
1,based reviews i saw  i assumed would perfect keeping blinds clean  that case  it clean dirt blinds way would think  i disappointed purchase 
3,duster delivered quickly good condition  however  i ordered wood blinds n t fit properly 
3,the mini blind cleaner comes attachment  implying use adapter fit every vacuum cleaner  fit shark lift away vacuum cleaner  fit others like electrolux 
5,like cd s  trout fishing america done  fun  entertaining music great adults  kids   whomever  trout continues favorite groups   s amazing get national publicity 
4,keith ezra s polished  mostly serious work non kids  very well done excellent new songs  my new favorite trout cd  hey  guys  n t forget roots silliness made us fans fall love 
4,trout fishing in america make kids music  well  album probably stand death play kids give  even adults  although i highly doubt many adults listen s merits  if need cd kids listen n t drive crazy  found  otherwise probably cd 
1,this video shows managers  roadies  freinds  talking the man  no complete songs even background  place music   if see hendrix play  s 
2,i thought would complete songs  like u  s rattle hum styx s return paradise  instead documentary short clips jimi performing  disappointing  
2,i really looking forward  as fan classic album series  i disappointed i watched  the volume level inconsistent  especially sections people talking music  you turn way re talking  quick remote music starts blow speakers  for die hard fans  keep volume remote handy  you ll need 
5,great looking toy  i magic no look pass pose towards lakers greats  good size similar resemblance magic 
1,i bought part daughter s train set  nothing disappointed  for starters  red circular center piece easily removed  i anticipate day comes missing permanently  the wood slightly bowed  though impede play  i expecting higher quality toy  brio   the disappointing thing  though  small turntable  i knew would support larger engines  e g  gordon henry   i surprised even mid sized engines edward james would fit  i wish i kept box i would love return item 
3,having read two novels david hunt nom plume well the dream broken horses  i really pumped read peregrine  after  edgar best novel came out after finishing  i n t know judges thinking  the plot really n t believable  ending predictable  characters move ways n t seem realistic i liked sense place conveys mid town upper manhattan  i liked intriguing details bird hunting  i really learned lot there however  melodramatic plot me i recommend read three books i listed  they re quite enjoyable 
2,i ve read several bayer novels enjoyed much  after hearing novel edgar award i eager read  well   must thin year edgar nominees  this book severe letdown  totally unbelievable got sillier ridiculous pages i read  honestly  i n t believe bayer would even still print  his novels  ones written david hunt  good  but reads like work amateur comparison  give miss 
3,good production  great beats  alright flow  and his delivery was ok too  but his talent as a lyricist is n t where i d like him to be  but all in all it was ok
1,if read beats beats  re eventually going william s burroughs  he s much voices  post world war ii  he drugs  longer harder deeper anyone else  he shocking squares living pathetic working class zombies  and s page   a strong  unique voice still imitated decades later unfortunately us living twenty first century  s relevant fins cars  it s convoluted  paranoia created mythology time space travel s shocking images sex death  it s story 
2,i ve never read anything william s borroughs  finishing  cities of the red night  i n t believe i ever  what strange befuddling mess  i challenge anyone able summarize plot book plain sense english language actually make sense  this loosely explained collection obtuse imagery  bizarre symbolism  wandering prose  distracted dialog  puzzling language   i actually wonder brand illicit substances author influence farted novel  it just does n t make any sense    that hardly go page two without reading either  shirtless adolescent boys    opium    compulsive sodomy  so despite mass confusion prose  i d say  s  i gave book two stars instead  cheers 
5,burroughs searches writing thing searched use  sex russian roulette games played guns  try distill experience pure essence means alive  single moment ecstasy living made real blinding flash  through graphic imagery sex death burroughs play like miscreant attacking cathedral pipe organ  pulling stops  feet pounding pedals  hands stomping keys  blasting pipes  in rush noise challenges find whisper truth  a liturgy scripture damned 
4,misanthropic challengingin work bourroughs sees mankind sociopathic mindlessly devising methofs self exterminationdifficul difficult put downyoull find possible answer bodily demands sustenance eliminationenjoy
5,burroughs drags nets held fifty years sorts information gathered  in lucid  almost straight forward prose  inspired denton welch   burroughs puts forward trilogy cities red night  place dead roads  the western lands loves hates  serves favourite genres childhood  pulp dectective  sci fi  pirates  high school theatre  egyptian  others naked lunch may messed  never infiltrated thinking much books  i think deceptively simple language sense  narrative continuity  help disarm act trogan horse if easily offended may skip burroughs altogether  though  case  i suspect need unsettle morals  little  reflect position 
3,read book  first ok cant read later  have many read 
5,this first novel i ve read shari macdonald  it great  she ranks right lori wick lori copeland  this must read 
2,i liked rashel quinn  really go together  it cool hunted vampires killed  i loved burned house 
4,i think rashel strong female charactor  i think flaw tends hypocritical  i think quinn good soulmate choice  i really liked book good plot i liked vampire vampire hunter got together  this favorite book whole series  i recommend buying book  least reading  good 
5,compared night world books best  i love rasheal brave finds soulmate fighting vampires 
5,of books l j written series   the chosen  far best  i read nine currently published books  still eagerly awaiting tenth   this book wonderful premise previous subsequent books  however  main characters depth many characters novels realistic motives  rashel quinn spend book trying ignore feelings eachother trying kill eachother  both things something books really lack  niether readily admit bieng soulmates  the two characters fellings towards members circle daybreak coin term  damned daybreakers   all things depth character contribute make great book rather marginally good book books series 
5,i really loved book  it made laugh made sad  i wish i could courage rescue dogs manner randy grim  truly inspiring stories 
5,a fascinating account s crusade rescue stray dogs st louis  book gives us incredible insight issues surrounding stray animal problem country  i learned i knew know feral dogs place society  but book dogs  lessons learned could easily applied  capture    saving  strays found cities  including lost  homeless children become commonplace  the behaviors exhibit scarily similar described randy grim book  a gripping read anyone interested plight strays world 
5,marie curie s youngest daughter eve given us gift writing biography mother  eve manages let us mother s private world inspiring full respect privacy  madame curie husband pierre exemplify meaning word integrity  rarity  especially culture constantly searching fame wealth cost  i read book multiple times like visiting friend learning bit remarkable person time 
2,the author points series crimes little importance largely forgotten  it remain 
4,this enjoyable history book  certainly best books i every read florida history  though filled facts dates  full stories make colonial st augustine alive  it helpful chapter little story s relates whole book  read separately  best  spanish inquisition makes appearance  nobody expects spanish inquisition 
1,if impress friends new dvd player     n t show film  it s straight forward copy video tape reaching tracking button   sound sync picture  the acting wooden plot dire  if fool enough buy  n t crying realise i m right 
5,when doctor gave choice crutches walker  i chose walker  my uncle offered use  i loved ease smooth gliding wheels especially hand brake  i never felt like getting away  the compartment handy traveling around book  meds  etc  doubled seat i tired rest  i think best walker market

1,as incurable beatle maniac  i looked forward hearing cuts cd  big disappointment   all songs remakes original versions  bad ones  none original peter  gordon billy j kramer versions  to make matters worse  remakes even faithful originals  cases even sticking original melody written  going interpretive  tangents    example  i hardly recognized  bad to me  done  save money  s even worth curiosity value 
1,a huge beatles fan stumbled across cd gift shop rock roll hall fame  i actually think   great idea cd     particular production horrible  they tried keep songs contemporary period written  instead  songs simple tracks written earlier years try combine elements beatles albums spanning entire career  the result best described atrocious mix taking songs may found  please please me   remixing fit style  revolver    sgt peppers   oh  n t help band used sucked  i think dozen beatles tribute bands maybe could done properly   these guys bad  do n t waste money

1,wavery voiced pop icon madonna incomprehensible non singer banderas absolutely destroy wonderful score  the orchestrations hideous  pass  get broadway version  masterpiece  lupone  brilliant   patinkin 
3,this version evita okay  some songs made lot better like  on this night of a thousand stars  new tango feel   and the money kept rolling in  extended instrumental  goodnight thank you  much career driven lyrics however  n t said songs  buenos aires murdered  such song energetic original concept recording original broadway recording became flat repetitive  rainbow high butchered removal anything relating ogliarchs aristocracy  eva s sonnet forgot turn rehearsals made madonna s evita politically bland  and lament it hurts think   madonna looked like evita sing like  there underlying ambition ruthlessness voice  maybe except speeches   antonio good becomes hard understand complex verses  pryce boring puppet
3,madonna antonio banderas nice job  but  performances lack power emotion broadway cast  you try broadway version patti lupone mandy patinkin 
1,i borrowed friend s copy listened version  madonna beautiful voice light role  antonio banderas woefully inadequate singing department  do favor n t buy recording  buy original broadway cast c d  patti lupone mandy patinkin  it far best version 
4,if re like  probably find cast recordings evita long drawn  well i ve found recording flows smoothly music nice  slightly updated sound  i hear lot hard evita fans critisice insult film version modanna antonio s talent  fact  good recording stars fine job
4,there two soundtracks movie  get  yes  bit expensive  get full expierience incredible soundtrack even incredible talent performing  absoute must 
5,i think evita best music piece ever  madonna antonio banderas best evita che  this musical probably i listen everything  even tracks like  a cinema bueonos aires  even though even music 
4,i love  my favroite songnd disk two called   do n t cry argentina   i think it s best recodings ever 
2,there argument soundtrack album well crafted artistic film unfortunately songs overproduced since original much rawer concept album loses much  edge  message i hope n t star ego led madonna  playing evita  singing  another suitcase another hall   the switch cast  originally sung mistress evita throwing  disappears view album  completely loses pathos point song great dis service whole piece buy concept album first paul jones  possibly under rated peron  julie covington  singing really hard nosed ladder climbing evita  hear sound audio 
5,i ordered sound tracks film evita sincest dec i still waiting delivered  i long time customer amazon i ve never problems deliveries  the item ordered meant christmas present  since s  i need answer please   p s happy new year all chas     
3,i madonna fan  i think acquits quite well cd  she fantastic movie  cd n t hold repeated listenings  first  antonio banderas n t really sing  emotion drama really weak voice  madonna s voice stronger used n t measure power beauty patti lupone  broadway trained diva  jonathan pryce wonderful voice ill used cd criminal  he n t get truly sing rather sing speaks lines  i think several years n t seen movie  n t understand everyone liked cd   thin 
5,i loved movie evita rented many times  movie store eventually sold  the songs upbeat s variety  kept attention  banderas madonna made great pair 
2,who told antonio banderas could sing  he n t  madonna could sing score  andrew lloyd webber s good ones  becoming rare items   hollywood lowered  this spoil balance musical  hollywood n t things like  they gave song belonging another character makes dramatic sense whatsoever  hollywood n t things like  either there many recordings stage musical available  buy instead 
1,the motion picture soundtrack  yet alone motion picture evita  terrible  hollywood  usual  took wondeful piece work  hit musical evita  butchered way  patti lupone far better eva madonna  least understand mandy patinkin  unlike antonio banderos  also  hollywood turned orchestrations modern rock n  roll junk  premiere american recording way evita  so n t waste money movie sountrack  buy premiere american recording instead
3,i never seen stage show  months ago got original london cast recording  elaine paige david essex evita che  i loved listened stop month  then i got dvd madonna evita thought dullest film i ve ever seen   read reveiws movie know  madonna n t quite live elaine paige  her voice quite rich beautiful paige s  madonna seemed make everything   pop y  for example buenos aires   i loved paige s version  madonna turned awful  tacky  latin american pop song the material great  artists  i m sure broadway recording  i would recomend people buy london cast  rather 
1,this cd horrible madonnas verson eva terrible allowed screw wonderful songs  dont cry    dont suggest cd anyone wants hear songs suppose sung   wan hear right way get elaine paige s version patti lupone    forgive spelled wrong     
3,not sure people completely honest  madonna s vocal performance amazing evita score much desired  there obvious vocal limitations  madonna improvised way  the  music  soundtrack good  antonio banderas another vocally qualified incredible andrew llyod webber musical production  patti lupone mandy patikin true vessels talent evita project

4,the street index hard read forty crowd  if font size  would much easier read 
1,although good collection poe s short stories  pages crisp typeface clear  the type itself is very  very  very small  i getting older  need glasses yet i hardly read word two eyes begin cross  i n t understand book manufacturers anymore  either typeface illegible  paper poor letters blot together  print teenie tiny  are n t books supposed read  also  something strange  chapters arent seperated  one story runs next without starting new page 
2,carrying mostly instrumental albums  the prison     the garden   get  rays   which nowhere strong albums  nez laying synths  giving slight queen s feel  nobody wants hear  he creates horn section using synths  sounds cheap  tacky with  prison     garden  hear richly textured  ambitious soundscapes   rays  low fi  i n t problem   n t work complete piece work this weak nesmith album  i suggest purchase rest back catalogue arriving  low  point 
4,i looking affordable aluminim case  looked good n t cost arm leg  antec surprised superlanboy model not work great  specially led fans  helps keep p system cool together antec trueps power supply  chances system malfunctioning due cpu mobo heat related problem zero if building ultimate  fail proof  system  i recommend use  rpm hard drives  like samsung s sv1204h still find   instead overheating  ones 
5, ve heard music  hear words  dvd gives insight extrordinary album early s  release polar opposite much musical landscape  timeless tunes created five talented musicians  joy levon helm s rich recounts harmonies  richard manuel rick danko structured  impromtu version unfaithful servant performed rick emotionally poignant  lp  couple keyboard demos garth hudson pythonesque  accomplished keyboardist  s scope  much less screen time compared last waltz  robbie robertson word two well  viewing dvd  cue band s lp turntable  tray cd  relive great work 
4,very good comprehensive review the band  gives good insight individual members songs written  a good addition collection 
3,it s bad levon robbie could n t interviewed together dvd  this reminder unfortunate rift two if fan the band  would find information interesting 
2,although recording somewhat ineresting  due lack music recording i find dissapointing  i probably play three four times dispose 
1,good god  boring  i could n t even finish watching i tossed  i usually enjoy reading hearing artists create  fascinates  and i love the band used  but boring heck  sorry  robbie  sorry  levon 
2,i screened dvd the band cost   if like minutes interviews musical clips  far better the last waltz  song  seen camera mixed great  send  i ll ship copy  i love the band looks like bbc tv doc bill
2,the reviews right very large girth  it bit uncomfortable  i n t love bumps back  n t see picture description    head  quite edge when package  overwhelming smell plastic  probably contains carcinogens everyone talking about the exterior piece very powerful would great another toy  the tickler fairly rigid difficult place exactly i would n t recommend i think better  and i think s worth spend money toy without phthaylenes  however spell  
2,this product not intended beginner   many toys far caught suprise big  the shaft big makes uncomfortable unless used right lubrication  being smaller petite woman  little uncomfortable b c size    pleasurable 
1,i find hard believe women really using product      turns s diameter cardboard tube inside paper towels  seriously

4,bought replacement used last  years  one received quite powerful original  gets job done  wife enjoys s thicker others used 
2,i like  it bit large plastic  rubbery smell never goes away  it s slightly loud  i similar toys i like least 
3,i ordered first rabbit  reading reviews i thought would good choice  it arrived discrete packaging  i thought awesome  the price good  especially compared websites it slight rubbery smell i opened package  goes away this rabbit pretty large  much unmanagable  when using alone  i found rabbit ears stiff positioned right get job done  the revolving balls really uncomfortable i ended using  i think rubber little softer may little comfortable  maybe  i expecting alot more the reason i gave  star rating i let hubby use  job well 
3,i ordered product june  first pleased  however  month little ago  late september early october    pleasure pearls  stopped working  the vibration still good  n t without rotating action  i expected product last longer  additionally  handle natural  clenching  well  times  pearls  would slow dramatically even stop  sometimes  batteries low  would spontaneously turn mid use due clenching  also  i ordered purple version  received clear version  product wide uncomfortable first  i strongly suggest lube going slowly first times  would i buy  probably 
3,this product works described girth toy massive  not beginners  material kinda hard 
1,i bought this item as a gift  i put batteries in it and it worked for three mins and quit  i have not been able to get it to work again and according to amazon policy i ca n t return it  do n t waste your money 
3,i absolutely loved toy first  it really amazing  about three months use  rotating beads stopped working  the batteries fully charged everything  nothing  it still vibrates everything still job  i wish lasted longer 
2,i got today playing couple hours n t gotten decent orgasm  this first vibrator toy ever i n t think i buying  maybe vibrations little nothing fact toys rabbit ears way long n t help  after playing awhile left frustrated i managed get weak orgasm worth anywhere near dollars paid  the vibe way thick awful chemical smell  i saved money  i continue try play around i hopeful  the rotating shaft nothing me 
2,it not not not waterproof  loved  tried tub  worked  seconds  stopped  very disappointed   
5,totally comfortable  extremely sensual love it i adore bunny ears controls super easyi recommend woman looking comfortable  intense pleasure  
2,received gift wishlist  i added positive reviews waterproof  clear design looked cool   quite honestly weaker cheapy   vibrator local shop  i tried water i n t comment  it stiff  rather big   mostly issue weak vibration  especially lacking area stimulated  the rotation nothing  with like jackrabbit  i expecting lot oomph  do n t bother product preference gentle   i found annoying 
2,it thick material hard uncomfortable i would recommend explained product really even though brand new box never used return product  so i wasted money  
4,good product  made well  bullet good amount vibration  hits right spots  i think rabbits bullet placed little higher better stimulation  also beads inside made steel placed wrong lil painful  the product however worth money 
2,this product worked   times rotation stopped working  batteries run lose power   uses  i would read reviews buying another   i looking hitachi wand massager i believe i buy since power operated toy never run power not impressed product 
1,received broken talking customer help chat refunded asap   satisfied service  
1,i bought item  months ago immediately disappointed  metallic beads almost painful higher rotation speed  and metallic rod connecting top bottom broke  months do recommend item 
2,i really excited receive product reading reviews  a day later i m quite disappointed  the bunny ears razor sharp  oucccchhhhhh    definitely save money go something else
5,what i say   i absolutely can not believe wonderful product  i  toys far favorite  i regrets complaints comes purchasing product  it certainly gets job done  quick  i never use minutes  amazing  it  speeds vibration clit stimulation   speeds rotation shaft  change direction rotates  completely submergeable  it even bumpy texture shaft stimulate g spot  as far batteries go  replaced often either  this well thought invention i n t think ways improve 
4,this favorite vibrators  while size little large beads movment shaft combined tantalizing bunny ears leave big o forgotten  couple notes state item waterproof true uses tub every time water got battery compartment  also vibrator battery compartment removed vibrator broke short time rendering vibrator useless  i tried contact company replacment compartment response thus far 
3,i got seemed sturdier vibratex kept breaking  this seemed studier i gave shot  it sturdier  larger  less pliable  quieter  the larger less pliable make quite uncomfortable  especially rotating part  i think would good comfortably accommodate something wider 
1,piece crap  all functions work opened stopped working first use   horrible product  california exotics ashamed selling junk  waste money shipping 
2,i used couple times  tiny bit water leaked battery compartment rusted n t turn 
1,what let  i excited get reviews  i tried  nothing  first  heavy hard hold  using   second  hurts clitoris  it sharp ears  s part goes clit  i m almost temped cut  third forth  smells loud i ve tried  times  trying get used  my husband tried use  no luck  this worth money

4,i saw online bought immediately  the toy i ever bought small bullet blew park  amazing  you must buy  most intense orgasm  put s boyfriend shame    
1,nothing say thank n t enjoy say something rate waste money
3,job  apparently wife needs hold hand strange angle get work  she rated  stars
3,little bigger i thought much movement job  the beads really n t anything i n t really feel 
3,it looks promising  competitive price  however  experience largely depends using  the rabbit s vibration worked fine  steady movement head beads wears pretty quickly getting used stops stimulus  even though adequate size  fully insertion might possible partner simply hate rubber 
2,once i wish i d paid closer attention critical reviews   this product far rigid thick  with beads material center  bend  s painful try use  there rigid bumps around too large tip   inches wide   inches around  make even painful insert  i ve used similar  far realistic  doc johnson product  beads rabbit  none bumps  natural tip girth  hoped thing  n t  on upside  s quiet doc johnson product  ll even quiet  unused  nightstand  waste money 
3,i ve bought  gf  she keeps shower ve learned either keep dry plan replace annually  local stores sell  would happy price  amazon s better vale  it nice toy waterpoofing 
2,the ears rabbit sharp first time i used i felt like cut wards  if ears n t sharp toy would higher list favorites 
2,i high hopes product rabbit habit s beads froze first time i used  i thought way beads set product would better  but   material stiff action bunny ears actually hurt clit  none softness thus realistic tongue like action rabbit habit  that s really point  n t  it poked  along hard little nose  hurt  cheap  waste money 
2,the picture shows several items select purple  alternate views  showing items  and kicker  colors  seems like package deal  i got purple vibe  i totally would gotten clear less money i knew case cares color really  i   function fashion  false advertising  
1,i misguided review ratings   honesty  product awful  it toxic smell   bunny ears  cause pain pleasure  i n t recommend product 
1,add list folks received vibrator shaped paperweight instead actual vibrator  i tried two sets batteries make sure  dead  also  others mentioned  toxic plastic smell over powering  i little bit glad n t work i might tempted try i may never gotten smell    amazon  understandably  n t allow returns vibrators  paperwork refund done hour i get days  least part easily done 
1,love size  complaints  rabbit ears hit right spot  but  beads jammed single use 
3,little bigger i expected  need get used  i think trick eventually  looks cool 
2,not made delicate sized person smaller areas exploration  all features described rabbit fast slowest setting  smaller would better 
5,i bought replace item i d purchased  years ago amazon  many  many uses  burnt vibe portion toy this product slightly thicker average rabbits  definately oversized  the motor quiet very effective  almost much  husband i like use playtime  i find i often turn hold back little   do n t hesitate purchase  price point  s best get 
2,i gave product  special  gift wife christmas  she loved first  times use  except make sure kids asleep loud  now spins away  vibrations  she still use occasions  still get job done  money i payed n t last near long enough 
2,i pleased product  bunny ears reach  pretty bump     i n t used ever since   i bought another  got work done way better  
1,recieved item broken  tried contact seller could  as amazon s return policy non returnable item  which makes sense  unless sold non working condition  was displeased i could speak directly seller amazon help  had go manufacture product replaced still work progress  will buy non returnable items site  leaves much room get defective product like i stuck 
2,best part  nice girth  unusual rabbit   worst  length  i find short  and    button stopped working  maybe wants keep going going going  l  i untwist bottom pannel loosen batteries turn off overall s ok  it supposed worked ok shower  i d like find something similar  little longer  shower i find head little stiff  made something little softer 
4,i really enjoy product  the thing s missing lock button  it tends get slippery times  buttons accidentally pushed  makes experience less pleasurable  i would product  sort locking feature i would n t stop adjust time 
1,i received product mail yesterday  put batteries rotating beads work  complete waste money 
3,the overall construction product good  however  vibrating bunny ears little long high vibrator seems impossible get everything line  seems like get right place careful move  also  vibrator use  squeezes hard enough metal balls move around quite easy stop painful squeeze  it tends bit wider vibrators  good  another girl i know n t enjoy using  it nice speed setting options n t favorite toy 
4,it s really big  i m impressed rotating dildo part i really n t feel much i guess i feel stimulation thrusting  however  rabbit ears  little nose  amazing  i turn lowest setting n t  minutes big  o   it would probably lot fun partner 
1,this first purchase vibrator disappointed  it shipped discreetly amazon directly  n t work  i put fresh batteries would n t turn  i even tested batteries  good  rabbit n t  unfortunately  amazon n t returns type personal product  i simple n t buy anything made california exotics  i ll try brands next time 
1,it little big  worked really well two weeks ago  and died  mind  two months i bought  i switched batteries  made sure ones i put working  i suppose motor died  i never even used water  i n t know people    d think d get two months vibrator 
1,i n t know good reviews  i purchased reviews s since gone trash  it awful smell n t go away  like burned plastic smell  it way big  the rotating beads nothing  even put hand shaft  squeeze feel rotation  do n t buy 
2,this product worked   times rotation stopped working  batteries run lose power   uses  i would read reviews buying another   i looking hitachi wand massager i believe i buy since power operated toy never run power not impressed product 
3,there good things  many bad things product  i ll start good  the vibration awesome  much enough the handle makes toy easy hold onto easy find buttons control speed   even includes reverse metal balls rotation  its big  big  i d say right the bad   i use metal balls rotation part toy main reason i bought  while size great  matches partners size perfect  adding something rotates  moves  made metal   much  good kind way  using stimulation would probably work using orgasm   hurt the ears slightly annoying   i cut  otherwise tendency poke wrong places overall toy great buy  even though rotation part  vibration awesome size nice 
3,i really like waterproof function buttons easy manage  it really quiet  what n t like big around    i know  know   supposed good thing  right  thing much good thing  the girth makes difficult insert much less stimulating using manually simulate intercourse  if      smaller around would great 
3,this ok dvd  i bought impression would something like dvds  live red rocks the dance  but documentary musical dvd  this made disappointing  but  hey  people absolutely fall love  i n t them if looking history fleetwood mac  would 
1,clearly  producers dvd meant mislead  the cover dvd shows original album cover suggesting visual equivalent album  please read cover carefully  it quickly put together documentary times surrounding making album  too much time taken showning closeups photographic stills already original album cover liners much time spent describing breakup relationships some new performances classic songs  quickly put together n t provide additional insights hastily produced dvd misleading cover cash unsuspecting fans 
1,rumours all time favorite albums  i dying see video  the making pink floyd dark side moon real treat  i high hopes  unfortunately  saying difficult trapped small studio together  breaking  the thing i already know  i got video  mick fleetwood seems like pretty nice guy  three self absorbed jerks  listen album  i recommend wasting time pointless thoroughly uninteresting video 
3,a question  does anyone know i get vhs tape fm rumors concert  it best live concert tape i ve ever seen  pls respond krecsy  bayserve net
1,this is a blatant case of false advertising that i ve ever seen  i m expecting to see fleetwood mac performing all the songs from their album rumors   which is a great piece of work    instead  all i see are the recording technicians explaining how they mixed the various songs  which  brings me to my main beef   only bits and pieces of the songs are played  none of the songs were played in their entirety  also  the interviews with the band members seemed to focus on who had an affair with whom and why the affair ended  who cares  i wanted to see f m perform and was verrrrrry disappointed when they did n t  at least i have memories of two of their concerts that i attended years ago 
2,the dvd documentory  alot talking little music  i thought concert  too much talking
1,well  i among expected basic performances along documentary  based packaging song titles listed text i m glad many people like means i trouble selling copy the sound quality n t impress   specially recorded  versions songs told members lost voices   offstage   sacrilege  burn    even navigation annoying  click  click  click  click get song bah 
1,if hear music  n t purchase video  each song quickly interrupted current interviews band members talking mostly failed romantic relationships recording rumours  this labeled documentary  music video  the band members talk music  nice clips shot sausalito  california s record plant showing particular tracks mixed  however  i believe using rumours album cover video packaging deceptively implies music video 
2,very disappointed dvd  like i said  view rockumentary watch vh1 alot cheaper  description misleading 
5,by far  best videos i ve ever purchased  this video takes band member memory lane get wonderful inside scoop really going behind scenes making rumors  stevie  christine  lindsey  john  mick tell personal struggles put aside survival band  with emotions running high gear  wonder best album yet  i watch couple times   remarkable video remarkable band 
5,this dvd fanstatic  interviews great band made tough times  going side this insight classic album great wonderful look  lives problems time now rely see hear rumours album way was now needs happen  record company get back sides re issue cd digitally remastered  while new greatest hits digitally remastered  would great 
2,having seen  the dance   i totally disappointed  i expecting least full songs cd  interviews band commentaries  also picture quality dvd  i bought region   bad quality  not worth buying

3,this book ok anywhere near league rosamunde pilcher book  but since i read pilcher s books multiple times wanted something new read  i tried  the plot nicely developed wickham pretty much tells everything going happen right front  thus taking away delicious suspense  the writing easy read lacks coziness pilcher s books

3,i m diehard fan sophie kinsella s chick lit titles i say i agree fellow reviewers compared negatively  although poignantly captured angst modern women go choices careers  romance childbearing  repetitious thread throughout chapters became tedious   lacked wit humor author loved  the lack lustre resolution heather spin disappointing  had i penning story  i would ended maggie s husband meddling mother in law hiring perfect nanny behind maggie s back returns work  person none heather christina hamlettauthor a bel air lawyer king henry s court

3,there doubt  romeo juliet  classic love tragedy best ever  however  many films stories watered book  see enough adaptations  ve enough  this little dated far dialogue concerned  shakespeare play i m talking  too much time taken betwwen action scenes  ending amazing  however  s enough save book average rating 
3,i m sorry  i really n t find book considered shakesperre s best  i hate character romeo personally  it bit soap operish  if re looking true work read macbeth hamlet  this far far far best 
5,the language wraps transports time land like  it s full love  hate  brutality  loyalty  all emotions get tangled mixed together  that lends amazing set circumstances  there greater love story juliet fair romeo  all love stories measured get lost classics story  it s true classic

3,this obviously review play since play gets  stars whether like  i happen years like less less nonetheless shakespeare s greatest best known plays   the arden editions came highly recommended someone master s degree shakespearean literature  yet  i unimpressed version  in fact  i found difficult read less well respected folger s edition i went back folger s edition  i n t find added material contributed anything knowledge understanding play actually made difficult follow play point i stopped reading edition went back folger s  least easier read straight 
3,the strengths famous play adorable intelligent juliet shakespeare s romantic language  the weaknesses   ending really sucks unsuccessful plan friar lawrence stupid  his plan make drugged zombie juliet convince parents dead  would priest  minister rabbi suggest  friar lawrence lacks courage intelligence  he consents marry lovers without parents  consent  n t backbone tell parents  what god s  and comes idiotic plan deceive parents  where learn religious guide others  his stupidity deceitfulness matched cowardice the beauty language  juliet s wonderful character play  call  stars  but utter stupidity script horrible ending drag 
2,i bought kindle none modern text translation referred reviews  i disappointed reason i purchased book  they use printed version reviews kindle books 
4,this n t favorite shakespeare s stuff  first  mercutio best character  soon  second  i n t really like romeo juliet enough lot died as metaphors allusions packed  s always interesting  i think people start shakespeare play  s difficult tragedies  i suppose good idea  after  go macbeth  best

3,i love book i could read iut agni even movie dose understand learn 
4,the classic romeo juliet  wonderful book  wonderful read kindle users  this book seems typed kindle  instead  s bunch pictures text  this results disjointed annotations inability select word screen pop dictionary

2,this product shipped reasonable time  description said new annotated highlighted throughout book  i disappointed since i wanted new version book 
3,it n t exact format i needed read class  liek act  line number  i order different version play   
2,there  versions book available amazon  the version looks identical picture look inside  n t  this  translation  shakespeare left page  high school students need  if notes  get book 
3,in opinion  book adaptable kids shows difficult dramatic situation romeo juliet  lot battles lot blood  kids it tells romeo juliet together families feud  juliet s mother wants marry called paris  in side romeo kill called tybalt  juliet s cousin  wanted kill romeo  so romeo escape mantua  finally juliet lies dead romeo goes see juliet s body kill paris  after committed suicide juliet too in conclusion i like s obvious children going read 
5,this definitely best play time  if never read  soon possible 
1,i bought book based reviews saying useful interpretations opposite page  in reality starts ends directly play  no prologue  introduction anything else  the reviews n t correspond item sold 
2,this book line numbers  in addition  pages n t scene act number  so open book  idea play  you flip pages find closest scene figure act go  this book makes difficult follow others class i would recommend anyone 
4,this edition romeo juliet worth getting annotations helpful  i readers likes everything annotated n t n t get  the notes excellent  helpful  introduction  i wholeheartedly recommend 
2,if teacher  i would look buying another audio version romeo juliet  i using tool get students hear professional actors ask use skills professional actors use  inflection  emphasis  etc   the problem very difficult hear   point  feet away hear times  this simply work classroom 
2,stupid teenagers  a boy falls love quickly falls  and poor communication  shakespeare got teenage romance pat 
1,romeo juliet story lovers meet first sight  the biggest problem together families fighting hate since born  it started romeo depressed ever day moping around feeling sad time loved rosaline love back  so day romeos cousin told party rosaline would left romeo saw juliet followed house exchanged thoughts decided get married secretly  so plan pretend juliet died get married planned failed ended killing  play stupid sucks read point reading play taking time 
1,read book  everybody like always talks great everything  n t think  like  s done  right   soooo cliched  omg 
1,the customer reviews edition romeo juliet indicated dual language  i e  original shakespeare side pages modern  translation   this edition original text  fine  wanted 
2,i high school english teacher looking different versions classics texts available kindle  fire   review play  rather ebook  readability  layout  price  features this cent version basic  it complete text play  s  it chapter select links either act scene  line numbers provided  there notations explanations  the layout maintain iambic pentameter poetry  text appears crowded page line break spacing speakers at cents  version bad  however  better  equally inexpensive versions 
4,romeo juliet read well plays hamlet  it must seen fully enjoyed  nevertheless  i would reccomend edition play  it dirt cheap  amount content recieve  well worth money  i reccomended  however i strongly suggest watch play first reading  i believe watch play fully appreciate 
4,i n t know book yet hahaha i read  thank  this i n t know
5,it old novel good time  a lot school use english reading 
5,the first time i read shakespeare book school  i thought going amazing recognised writers history  but i could n t understand anything  old complicated language young people n t understand well enough  i think style complex us  older people could understand well enjoy  but case i would recommend women  i really n t think like kind love stories  two people strongly love forbidden families  i recognise good ending s  this personal opinion  may like  i respect william shakespeare i think awful 
4,books shakespere something n t read fun  read slowly savoring moments every word spoken character  by reading romeo juliet  would understand tragidy love   would risk lives  shakespere really define true love 
1,not i n t like shakespeare s works  tragedies terrible  especially  i n t understand language real well  i grab contemporary language ll easier understand  i n t understand love tragedy  here things confuse  how feud really begin  why n t story happily ever  why lady capulet stuck everybody  why could n t shakespeare written language could understand  why everybody jump conclusions  i simply n t understand people love play much  it s ridiculous  if true love story  try reading  a midsummer night s dream   this absolutely sucks             
3,i read book  i saw video  this story helps us realise real love meant time taught us new difficult language n t know  it detailed story full love hate this story impossible love finished killing two main characters  romeo juliet  this shows time sexist selfish woman treated badly  this story made feel sad time angry unfair families them in conclusion appreciated much book learnt lot  especially love hate among people  another thing learnt inside person counts physical appearance julia jesica
2,this may great works humanity  n t cut  the gender sterotypes nauseating  say least  though required schools  book nnot bests read time  or maybe i disillussioned 
2,i bought book hoping could help understand shakespeare s words better  didnt  instead i look every word dictionary sometimes even online  soon got hectic threw book bought better reliable source 
5,this book classic real journey  really saying  thing i dislike book names sides  if looking script best thing told use  plus book defines uncommon words numbers beside defined next page  a true five star book 
5,i stumbled upon set day store i initially purchased based familiar artists track listing  what i purchased turned probably best compilation downtempo music i ve ever heard  from start finish discs i n t turn  if re enjoying directly compilation makes excellent background music re friends enjoy drinks  i recommend set anyone fan downtempo music 
2,that sums collection well  it s put club med  perhaps says something people s minds  what amounts fairly non offensive collection big name artists  kool the gang  wes montgomery  roy ayers  sweetback  sade fame  downtempo  think muzak likely played club med resorts sandals resorts vacationers find club med still suitable  somehow ever   south beach  monaco  cannes mer st tropez discrimnating tastes not i say packaging style substance  beyond  far superior products  literally fraction cost  avoid unless absolutely everything else collection far nothing better listen  i doubt  
3,legacy s essential series finally gotten around releasing collection country queen dolly parton  the track listing features songs parton s early s recordings way dolly s grammy winning reading collective soul s song  shine   the sound collection s best due remastering tracks hopefully jewels dolly s time bmg  legacy s parent company  reissued label original form  parton rich catalog recorded music  long print needs reissued whole new generation discover enjoy if new dolly fan  collection  long time fans still longing early s dolly albums reissued probably already recordings featured cd 
5,like new little wear around edges binding crease pages cripse  over i m happy 
2,wiley investment classics generally fall two categories  tough dreary reads full information  lively entertaining accounts educate  unfortunately  mr bagehot mr bernstein s text former  the book outstanding job promoting importance strong central banking system importance strict credit control combating financial crises  however  amidst extremely repetitive somewhat painful language  the authors provide outstanding quantitative anecdotal evidence supporting case  way makes book true labor read this book would beneficial anyone research  working kind central banking organization  otherwise  i would suggest looking wiley investment classics interesting educational read finance 
1,this excellent book  but edition extremely poorly produced  there far many typos  little information original publication book  example  the layout ugly  it s great book cheap  i wish i paid little nicer version

1,i would like seen book i bought  i never would bought condition i found 
1,while nice pictures helpful information i abit disappointed book general  it short  pages large text   color pictures n t seem like helpful book first time mother  the book first published update i m sure quite new discoveries would quite informative first time mother since  i felt like i reading high school biology book  ok i d recommend 
3,first release cd tracks  only boc tracks  and two songs solid boc tracks rock  the others instrumental tracks basically  plus get bands movie  bad channels low budget sci flick  but point boc needed crack make melodic hard rock cd  but least got back  it s boc completists certainly  songs good boc songs rest ok still real boc cd buy fire unknown origin  get complete boc collection  great band  make great music 
4,for fact book written years li s death  information fresh probably quite accurate  i wish book lot photos  i enjoyed reading 
2,this book lacks depth seems promise  some illustrations lacking  there enough meat help anyone special needs learners  i would suggest look elsewhere  i greatly disappointed since majority work jensen wonderful 
2,the chapters set like pamplet bulleted information  it n t seem appropriate college class  it written like middle school textbook  n t offer information laymen already know 
4,the cable works perfectly obviously professionally made  they worked great bridging liu switch across wall gigabit speeds  i would expect much higher necessary  the price seems gone way since i bought however  making great deal  even fast prime shipping 
5,i worked abortion clinic twenty years anne baker s work required reading new counselors staff  in addition book excellent resource seasoned counselor  her expertise sensitivity dealing host patient issues relating abortion becomes apparent first pages manual  she manages provide useful guidelines help clinic staff deal special stresses involved working abortion clinic 
2,written s s really old apply todays lifestyles trends fry cookery classics  glad i bought used but shipping price 
4,i really appreciated book i got views homosexuality  they offended  i almost stopped reading right  but  i remembered outdated language references checked copyright date   so i cut slack unenlightened viewpoint homosexuality read rest book  i m glad i did her outdated view points notwithstanding   excellent book raising children confidence high self esteem  i looking something help vague plans raisingmo turn something cohesive  this book said i thinking  concisely  recommend 
1,avoid book basis dated harmful passage page states homosexuality  related failure identification  parents homosexual children  seek professional help earliest possible moment   their view cause homosexuality mainstream thought  implies something wrong happened  the main reason need counseling would homosexuality causing adjustment self acceptance problems  this author s mind  following author s advice fails honor childs true nature  certainly would detrimental development his her self esteem 
2,thrilled daughter s pregnancy  i purchased book i could remember much i admired years ago i read  her feedback   mom  s really good gets homosexuality  it fails miserably   i reread passage page library edition i throw public library s collection   i n t   i ll keep good parts try forgive brigg s out dated misinformed attitude   but i n t give  stars 
4,reading early great help  my still quite young  i m already getting good ideas getting good habits help build self esteem  this information makes feel like confident parent 
5,well  say  love needed  believe seller given book credit  categorized very good   condition  was  please  started reading class already actually grow fond book interesting filled knowledge 
5,i half way book enjoying every page  the author seems enlightened well  makes read enjoyable  god bless soul  my condolensces loved ones  seems passed away sep    
2,i buy book child bearing friend i saw outdated view homosexuality  pitty  this book good many espects  event child anyone close family homosexual  probably result parent s mishandling situation perhaps good deal damage child s self esteem 
2,while book contains many helpful explanations expect children grow contains wildly outdated depictions women  women described working home  cleaning baking  men described working ceaselessly outside home time children  the book originally writtens shows  in today s world  women work outside home i found depictions off putting  i mean  wow  i kid  m  mom worked outside home the greatest ding book though  s offensive depiction homosexuality condition worthy immediate psychological attention   i gay  married two children either sons gay  i support choices heart  send psychiatrist 
4,i read many books manson well  serial killers   there legitimate debate whether manson lumped category  digression of books i read manson  surprisingly seems least self serving  the whole notion  helter skelter   i honestly believe preached followers  actuality way catalyst tate labianca murders  motive put forth prosecutor vincent bugliosi seems self serving i n t reveal anything important  manson surprisingly candid book version seems much plausible realisitic accounts i read 
2,this book unlike books written topic  while nuel emmons seems started eye ball  release new information manson case  fell short goal virtue adding lot things n t really manson  words  nothing fabrication 
4,this book began childhood manson numerous institutions s throughout life  it eliminates hype sheds light truth madman behind mask gives personal account experiences led institutions duration life 
2,ok  manson collector course  otherwise even good read  let alone manson s words buy collecting  read helter skelter family better read 
1,  charles manson nuell emmons s words  anyone s seen heard manson interviewed  knows lingo knows n t words 
1,i ve communicated charlie occasion the write talk like book reads end story however  written word legible  unlike someone wrote review  little hard read s years old i would imagine hands tremble bit   but book   waste money the reverend
1,hell  i m even going read book i tell i think  no reason waste time reading anything written animal like manson i m kind learning infamous cases like manson s   i d like hear the truth happened  and criminals usually not tell truth  they usually way detaching   identity committed instigated whatever heck crime  so i read reviews  n t sound like manson   gosh  earth i surprised  hey   good laugh  i guess would ok read   see beast like manson operates but i give star   like i said  consider sanity source information book   best believe unless someone right mind confirm it otherwise  enjoy 
2,while fairly well written book anyone ever connected manson  manson s followers  manson case said way charles manson anything book first  manson  speaking makes no sense whatsoever secondly  if anyone ever seen manson s written word  make sense  s legible third  the  frame  wording  sound like anything i ever seen  read  heard manson fourth  manson denied anything book since written  publication  years since some information book factual  based upon trial transcripts  conversations documented elsewhere  however words attributed manson  opinion author s words  not bad read  something i would recommend someone looking truth  
3,offers unique insights nonetheless  no  part chrles  words  thoughts  there honesty  plenty omissions  especially regarding mansons mind control tactics whether intended  portayal manson book  estimation  idiot  time loser  way getting troubled young girls follow  the compelling interesting parts personality  ability utterly brainwash group people   utterly refuses cop 
5,manson in his own words allows you the reader to see things from manson s point of view  i was impressed how charles manson did not down play his role in any of his horrible crimes  he owned up to them and realistically points out how he would have been more content spending his life behind bars  he also allows the readers to see how the other family members were in fact responsibile for their own actions  i ve read many books on the subject of the manson family and i must say this was definetely a welcome different point of view on the subject 
4,i love miss kittin  that s i ve given  instead   she completely awesome  music rocks  though album  i ve listened  i n t found anything really thrilling cd i mean  i really love miss kittin  my favorite song    done hacker different cd the thing i really say cd   requiem hit  better songs cd  i n t know  maybe i m n t mood type music late  s i n t get cd  so perhaps  later  i back  edit review show totally awesome thing ever conceived 
1,people often rave great album  i really n t see appeal  at risk sounding simplistic  cd full pretensious songs pretentious people  bad melodies  catchy  little edge  awful  there much good music  i n t fathom would listen 
3,although i completely enamoured miss kittin s latest offering  batbox  excellent album  i find album bit annoying  s hard listen tracks sitting  lyrics part superficial meaningless  no detectable coherence linking songs together  probably good nightclub set  i like music driving relaxation  it merit indicating miss kittin  developing artist  dratically improved since i com 
4,i read three books individually compendium  all i think line oliver twist     please   dahak colin i among best heroes market 
3,1st book looks much like david s  apocalipse troll  nd reminds john ringo s posleen war  centauroid aliens  tinkered  kill species   rd hybrid assasination plots honorverse  religious power hungry fanatics used someone else     john ringo s prince roger series  heir empire landing technologically inferior world     do n t know took  course s ok rework ideas  may  unfortunately  i ve read books prior  i enjoyed  
2,david weber uses trick book i think cheating writing  good way  one chapter ends main characters dire straits  next starts overcome problem without explanation  did get tired writing inept  otherwise i d say i would recommend book readers age  to adult characters seems trifle  fantastic   
4,while i could n t put  i feel like i finished long outline  great concepts throughout  makes get telescope look moon say    weber s style reminds web griffin beowulf  chapter peeking hour action  spread months years  villains heros dispatched alacrity gore  this could framework whole series books hands another author  perhaps delving deeper characters worlds  but i certainly appreciate classic scifi visions 
5,rocks right best bands  mirror spirit best songs long time  the band better guys right silvertide  possibly rose hill drive  sounds like classic s s rock roll  the singer great voice  i believe eric shea lead guitarist girl really play  expect see guys completly rocks  rock roll stay down list bands true rock fans check  new bands save scene the darknessjethurricane partyparchman farm  only ep rocks find amazon   rose hill drive  ep amazon  they toured van halen completly rock guitarist incredible   supagrouptokyo dragonsyoung heart attackblack keysand best new band silvertide
4,parchman farm new band san francisco  they named paul butterfield blues band song  they remind lot bands father s record collection like blue cheer steppenwolf  many parchman farm songs seem like could co exist somewhere easy rider soundtrack  the song  mirror spirit  alternates soft nice sounds heavy rock   too many people  sounds like deep purple best  keyboards record  songs like  say yeah  appealing heavy riffs cool vocals  this pretty interesting record  i could believe recorded  last year  this recording makes think time trip back time 
1,why would i choose listen i already every black sabbath album  every blue chear album  i mean it sounds like cover band pretty much  but fare well music industry favor creativity fashionable rehash  such life 
1,i bought trim toenail clippers  njmom s review   njmom stated clippers  straight    curved   wrong  clippers curved  i emailed farm  home supply center  rga number  return clippers never got  i ll keep i m happy if straight cutting blade toenail clipper  ones  get tweeezerman ones 
4,the album trouble  akon  good album  right mood  like songs like locked up an lonly sad depressing belly dancer show out trouble nobody beat  whatever mood  akon s trouble matches 
2,i two products sent both inoperatable packaging open   ughhhh   very disappointed mention frustrated 
5,this earset must tried  nothing like used kid  it fits well  light guess  hands 
2,sadly a modern magician  s sequel a calculated magic aged well  they feel s
3,if like erasure  pet shop boys depeche mode  like  very synthy group i think goal continue makes synthy music 
1,i believe groomer would better smaller difficult hold  the pin brush head bristles hard  the large head makes suction strong dogs comfort   i  dogs   
3,while killer plot gotten little confused the lipstick killer  the zodiac   seems character defined direction  belushi  obviously comfort zone  plays kind detective pray never investigating murder unless goal unsolved mystery  bracco hand seem understand character  unfortunately play her the plot totally predictable manage stay focused  still mildly entertaining ignore bad casting decisions  with said  s beacon light comes highly underrated faye grant whos role far small save movie whole  perhaps bracco s role d whole new ballgame  if re looking steamy  edge seat thriller  keep looking  little diversion reality awhile  let faye grant show steal scene 
2,there n t anything new found text n t covered thoroughly texts  the topics covered seemed glossed without meat substance  skip date books 
4,me  practicioner jkd wing chun kung fu found book interesting  it shows bruce lee used wing chun knowledge skill basis jeet kune do  this book shows wing chun jeet kune do would handle situations in personal opinion jeet kune do much simpler  direct practical terms hand to hand combat  jeet kune do rooted overlooked 
4,good read featuring two renowned sifus  two important martial art sysstems bruce lee  jkd  wc fans enjoy book 
4,i satisfied book basic wing chun comparation jeet do i recomend book introduce wing chun jeet 
2,do really think stuff going work  especially trapping  many people love trapping try sparring doesnt work the lin lop  bong lop  hand tan lop sau cmon none works anyone doesnt leave hand throw punch  may people fought hundreds thousand years ago certainly isnt practical  spend lots precious time learning art cant use sparring street it but like bruce said   matter person woman  more important art system  even applies jkd wing chun not way around                                             
1,would buy it not worth money did tell things i could see cities would recommend anyone 
4,this story blew away  i thought going another hair books women around beauty salon gossiping  n t  it sweet touching story woman wanted married age thirty five   children picket fence  when n t get wish cut hair  that simple well written  i cried i deducted point  i n t like sad endings 
4,  nappily  entertaining   however  characters venus khandi worked nerves  both shallow agendas  a lot time spent venus  finding  need time time  much time devoted  we privy main characters  thoughts insight them the book s opening left  hanging   i surprised ending  i give writing four  reviews    i bored 
3,i found book less substantial  it seemed jump around real focus  for example  cut hair   i understand history black women hair well  yet story angle goes nowhere what undefined character  i hard time figuring going  she convinced right clint yet aspect never fully developed  she harrassed everyone seeming injustices real basis she meets plane short time later love  what happened  i enjoy rambling story 
3,the story well written  i little disappointed ending  the book could ended  much better  a woman go wait  years get married  break up marries woman known couple weeks  give break 
3,as happily nappy  woman  i ran bookstore book released  the story entertaining  nothing nappy hair  issues black woman natural hair  this story black woman various relationship issues  nappy issues   i felt could permed hair story would essentially i feel title misleading  thomas  writing style good enough  i felt story dragged thc characters transparent generic soap opera ish   if terry mcmillian type story  n t expect anything new    
4,venus sista going every way  she good job  live boyfriend long pretty hair  out blue day  venus goes beauty salon instructs stylist cut hair sends boyfriend way  wonder cause  venus search independence  this outstanding debut  god s blessing s author 
2,while author good job illustrating personal  good hair vs bad hair  trauma black girls everywhere  included   much novel bogged romance novel cliches make overall plot resonate 
4,i enjoyed reading book i think character  venus johnson  could developed  i expecting hell break loose cut hair    however  actuality  cutting hair result  it seems fulfilled life cutting hair still never gained fulfillment  if anything  added havoc life  least mind   the title book excellent choice eye catching sparks curiosity  however  venus neither  nappy    happy      irony  overall  great job first time author  i applaud mrs thomas work wish much continued success 
2,c mon  we ve read stuff  e lynn harris  bebe moore campbell  terry mcmillan  ad nauseum  and done better  i n t know black people talk act like characters  they like cardboard cartoon people  for talk  cutting  hair  venus still not nappy   she finely textured hair  goodness sakes  she even compared jada pinkett close friends  the title    i felt cheated i read book  as matter fact  i skipped  do n t buy  rent library must 
3,this novel guilty pleasure  off base  confusing happily ended relationship 
3,venus clint love another  sometimes s hard tell love more ms  thomas begins engaging page turner make laugh think venus takes search self  hair  the journey long sometimes draining hair long  seemingly takes us strand  read   venus clint live happily ever without kinks  the kinks venus  hair  couple s eyes self centered  once attention taken  venus clint find love live happily ever 
4,i think the book nappily ever after was apage turner and somethings that happen in everyday life  like the saying goes u have  let some things go  let ur blessings flow  and i guess thats what she did  u got me on some parts of the book b c i really thought it was kandi who was sending those notes  venus but it was tyson s wife  i think that venus lost out on a good man b c she wanted him  marry her when she wanted and that s what happens when people get greedy and want what they want when they want it  she did find her another man at the end and that was all well and good and i was happy for each of the characters in the book and i wish u the very best in ur career  u r a very talented woman and god blesses those who bless others and u have w ur inspiration  ooh before i forget i know u have probably heard this before so i hope u do n t get offended but on ur picture u look like lynn whitfield  that is not a bad thing  god luch and god bless 
5,i enjoyed book  i needed read book like  there feelings i need change book made realize 
3,i expecting based title  not preachy  soapbox kind way  main character felt living  nappily ever   i m tired black novels smart woman making foolish choices comes  i find redeening quality woman s ex boyfriend make worthy someone s husband  he seemed boring shallow  great loss  the catchy title sucked two dementional book 
2,i struggled book  the storyline bore  i anxious read book highly recommended  i disappointed  if absolutely read book  borrow someone library 
1,i purchased original klaatu album vinyl  i love album much cd  however  hope  far theatrical  virtually actual songs  if i could give stars i would 
3,book certainly interesting read  think represents left center view point  covers quite wide range topics times writer takes leap faith inorder justify hypothesis  times theories seem bit streatch  however would recommend book interested world view put people right center 
3,labeled good muslim bad muslim introductory chapter concerning misconception fundamental political islam western discourse  i assumed book would something  unfortunately  dissembled genealogical history modern islamic terrorism  undeniably  mamdani s case  purely western  specifically  american israeli roots  in reality book nothing indictment american history  israeli history  spanish history  british history  dutch history  french history  never afghani history  nicaraguan history  sudanese history  nothing diatribe  although  i give three stars  incredibly well written  engaging  beautifully cited  authenticated  accurate  know  scholarly level though causes compact thesis self sustaining  n t really cover whole truth  student  amherst college
3,i ve read books reynolds published ace imprint  definitely least favorite  the central conflict feels contrived  in number ways  faction fights among rockhopper crew seem like lite version  wildly convincing either  even bitter  quite bit meaningful fights among martians kim stanley robinson s mars series  more frustratingly  important disagreement objective facts central story  even though facts knowable  never revealed  still  reynolds still compels compulsive reading even s best  i recommend book reynolds fans  familiar work read revelation space series considering 
2,this first book alastair reynolds i read  i must say i disappointed  the idea behind book interesting  but reynolds  writing pedestrian best  the pacing terrible  the characterizations thin  the book drags hundreds pages  falls apart last  it seems like editor got nervous length told ar wrap quick smart i would read books ar given  i n t buying others 
3,the story new  similar arthur c clark s tales told  rama  series  but well written held interest 
2,i usually enjoy thrill grand space operas  no suspense though  everything totally predictable  the conflict svetlana bella tedious  aliens somehow uninspired  i enjoyed couple books  far long uneventful 
1,musk dogs   fountainheads and spaceship s grill long two crabby women fight freakin  years years  yes i finished book i know wanted leave  structure   granted first part book full promise  chasing janus problems ensue   wheels fall  read first  book pick something else 
4,i ve enjoyed alastair reynolds  books since i stumbled upon revelation space  i bit disappointed century rain  partly i wanted revelation space series   partly n t live promise reynolds  earlier books  i enjoyed reading  much i d hoped pushing ice improvement   s good solid epic space story  reynolds knack good ideas good characters  shows pushing ice  there s particular conflict story n t quite work  unfortunately s central plot  felt bit forced  like people known better   i could done bit explanation exploration bigger picture   regardless  i really enjoyed story looking forward next book 
3,there s great sci fi story  if someone spin outline watercooler  d sound like must read  but despite character building  comes crunch time  reynolds downs crafting tools merely brutalizes characters like     sock puppets this book cant put down qualities rama  calling space opera n t long  delightful sci fi segments justice  author intervenes bully characters plot conformance  i leave book several days i could pretend pages never happened 
4,this good read  it start slow  really hooks  and felt though several books  i loved balance political intrigue  personal passion  science  while perfect  good adventure 
5,after many years wandering lost amid fantasy mislabeled sf  turning desperation oldies goodies written niven  zelazny   i stumbled onpushing ice  fabulous  enough explanation non physics major follow  pretend   plenty action  the typical male failure  sorry  guys  track character development  quite possible  sorry  girls  woman hold implacable grudge years even   stars pleasure read really good  new  hard sf 
4,an exciting science fiction novel pushes limits scientific imagination  mr reynolds phd astronomy worked the european space agency years  now  full time science fiction writer  this novel explores behavior humans presented arduous undertakings reveals darkest fears try cope unique way  in science fiction frame  reynolds tries state wired us pure evil pure goodness mix  how much component determine course actions makes  because i m total geek  i loved  give try might love   shakirbahzad
4,i brought book reading favorable reviews  i disapointed  i enjoyed build story  large story covering many years many stories within  would definitely recommend space sifi addict likes good story many twists 
5,other reviewers mention technologies relationship previous stories  yes  i would add pushing ice major novel featuring complex  believable female protagonists  they deal frustration competition intellectual level  first contact story  lot  people change gradually  clinging old beliefs  universe changes drastically around them several chapters build toward crises  i hesitated start next character faced certain defeat  but disappeared  new scientific concepts thereby introduced  the last chapter really tale find wondering crew rockhopper encounter next  this book really pulls lives 
3,i avid fan alaistair reynolds chasm city among all time favorite books ever  the setting  people whole atmosphere perfect  pushing ice  delivers interesting setting  the whole  moon makes move system  good but i n t read pages get thing interesting part starts get tiny bits last pages the whole women friendship theme  bit top  locking someone years made bad call  make  still grudge the fountainheads part interesting  mentioned far short 
3,this excellently photographed book upbeat  time related  narrative subject  unfortunately interested history actual dates radios issued reader guess  somewhere   not great resource someone starting collection trying date artifact found attic 
3,i bought koi hoping bargain quality windsocks  they fly alright cheapest nylon imaginable already fading  the string cotton twine need add swivel spin wind  cheap chinese junk 
4,this work best read context reich s work whole  in particular  work quite different rest reminds us prolific author  in book  reich draws parallels crucifixion modern day emotional pathologies  it may painful read book  it equates murder christ  common modern day phenomenon active participants 
4,heavy read   still worth get understand institutions masses function individual persons willing change paradigms

2,i recently purchased used  gb view  it works well  gb view support gb sd card  the literature internet said would support gb card 
2,i happy sansa view  sudden micro sd chip missing  i could n t imagine someone stealing chip  i tried put new  i noticed would installed second two spring inside unit would expel chip  it would actually launch   inches  so i know original chip somewhere gym  certainly vacuumed now it s great player  check make sure sd card n t easily send back 
4,mostly happy product  except fact s dreadfully slow fast forward reverse  as might imagine become frustrating times  and totally unable skip ahead another part recording immediately similar ipod do   c mon sandisk  give us software correct serious inconveniences  
3,this player looks good  sounds good  get eq settings right  expandable memory  thats good stuff  its big color screen habit locking whenever press button  it show album art previously played song  title shown may may correct playing  it likes freeze press button rendering inputs inoperable unfreezes  it likes list songs stored memory expansion card twice  includes album art pictures  i ve downloaded every firmwire update still problems  but  leave play shuffle mode makes fine jukebox 
5,i bought use taking unbox videos mobile  great  clear little screen  very easy use  easy transfer media  compatable unbox  windows media  rhapsody yahoo music  soon rhapsody    ca n t load photos  i think s problem computer rather sansa media converter   it originally worked i started messing bit  easy use   will fix problem i find time  until  s big deal   expansion slot big plus  the view automatically senses media loaded adjusts accordingly  feature absent e250  i  great sound right earphones  loads space  what else i say n t already said  i love little view hope lasts long time  good price amazon  always 
2,nice player except microsd card fails recognized anymore  the problem n t card  i ve tried several   is player  the disappointing machine fails recognize even card slot  the expansion card slot meaningless  and appalling day warranty  see sansa little faith products  it really looked disposable  get really  really cheap  get something else  the rest machine operates fine pretty reasonably intuitive  but   but  expansion card issue massive  strange failure  i would n t recommend  perhaps sandisk product  this should not happen

3,the subtitle book   the true story of the manson murders   bit misnomer  this really true story vincent bugliosi  investigation manson murders subsequent trial  manson  family murders supporting players  there alot detail page book   gathering evidence boring courtroom semantics  certainly bugliosi commended work  i n t need know aboout  it exhausting  n t  there interesting interaction bugliosi manson  brief  i read book hoping learn manson strange interesting  bugliosi  subject  sorry  vince  strange interesting 
5,i years old summer remember vividly  i n t read helter skelter i  first came learned first time many detail  book truly stays mind  that reviews say haunts many years actually feel hot summer night  sharon jay talking bedroom strange woman walks orders living room  how terrifying could sharon watching jay front frykowski folger fighting lives knowing well unborn child could n t defend  bugliosi wrote compassion victims truly thank people behind bars  watching charles manson talk television shows unremorseful always 
5,i found book interesting disturbing  it s details would know charles manson case to think could convince people carry horrendous crimes  that skill story telling making people follow blindly  i enjoyed reading details case evidence would start new leads  bugliosi excellent job walking us crime  way trial i could put book  it s definite page turner  many photo s victims  killers evidence  not squeamish  detailed 
1,have read manson file  it obvious control people lsd  obvious fact manson kill anyone 
1,the fact matter book total fiction  elaborate work vincent bugliosi s imagination due due ignorant superstitious  ideology   he needed give  evil    manson convenient   helter skelter  made bugliosi wealthy beyond belief i guess whatever sells book  right  charles manson  human   simply collateral damage 
1,bugliosi s ghost writer crafted skillful heroic prosecutor deciphering real motive murders  despite incompetence police department  you know practically everyone studies manson case detail regards book work fiction  way regard bugliosi s ridiculous made up motive  trying start race   there info hard get elsewhere  otherwise simply attempt sensationalize make money  there far better books read manson case

5,in begining book reads  this book scare hell  ever understatement  charles manson crew always ultimate evil  the time put book sleep   
5,my husband always wanted add helter skelter book collection today opened christmas gift  it s four hours later s still reading  pausing every tell disturbing connection made music murders  this perfect gift 
5,this fascinating account manson case eyes prosecution attorney vincent bugliosi  well paced  haunting  somewhat grissly  suprisingly quite funny places  defense attorney made two hunderd objections first three days trial    a real pager turner probably best read daytime n t give nightmares  one quible though i feel author grossly misinterpreted philiosophy friedrich nietzche affilating philiosophy spread nazism  yes hitler  shared manson many characteristic s  loved animals humans  vegetarian  spent time  outsider  living fringes society  read work  yet documents read greatly adulterated cursed hand authors sister   philosophers death wrote manuscripts fit nazi ideals hope courting parties leader  
3,helter skelter book charles manson manson murders  it written da prosecuted manson  there lot interesting information book regarding crimes weird court events followed but book review  i ll say book so so  some people s reviews little edge  i e  caught  feel  whole ordeal  bottom line  interesting piece history done moderately well 
2,amazon n t tell  learn pay kindle title  illustrations photos regrouped footnotes point making worthless  a disappointing result fine book great crime history relevance  this title not purchased kindle expecting receive honest copy complete book  i trust kindle titles unless print copy kindle title never know omitted  removed edited fit obviously limted format 
5,this book certainly pulitzer prize winner  definitely must read true crime fans  i found unable put book hours  bugliosi carefully unwinds horrific details surround infamous murders  this book much gruesome exploitive account  i found understanding late sixties tumultuous period could host episode history 
5,this excellent book horrific crimes ever committed even today s standards  the research  details  explanations absolute top notch  it evident vincent bugliosi greatest prosecuting attorneys ever step courtroom  the way rationally reconstruct events crime get heads criminals lay motives amazing  the courtroom drama re created dramatic detail feel tension  suspense horror throughout trial  we learn alot cult psychology people driven extreme bahavior  what s even scarier people world like charles manson s fanatical followers ready darkest bidding 
5,this book vincent bugliosi far best book i ever read  the manson murders interesting subject i ever researched  being prosector longest trial american history author extremly good writer  i recommend book anyone well worth money
4,this book endlessly fascinating manson story endlessly fascinating bugliosi  prosecutor  curt gentry  real writer  manage avoid sensationalism  but s really pedestrian work  eminently readable  nowhere near level capote  in cold blood  mailer  the executioner s song  
5,mr bugliosi able make us feel throuhtout nightmare  this book keep toes  wondering locked doors night  for born yet like  testament crazy idiotic losers present every generation  williwng unthinkable  the skills genious shown behalf bugliosi trial enough make anyone achieve excellence  matter field expertise may

2,a book promising premise cool cover  i bought  i must admit   unfortunately  picture cover little actual story  the storyline plodding uninspired  character development leaves much desired  the conclusion weak muddled  the first person perspective mesh well story  the illustrations somewhat cheesy  n t really add anything story  i really wanted like book  ultimately i came away disappointed

5,what incredible compendium  i would like see us create something similar japan s cultural national treasure robert frost would certainly included 
5,for us poets live poems read anthologies  it may case poet especially love gone read poetry this volume presents wonderful opportunity devotees frost book work lifetime for frost  the road not taken    birches    mending wall  host scattered lines   good fences make good neighbors    the land  land s   frost however  i must admit  poet whose life casts shadow work  unfortunately perhaps i long ago read parts thompson biography frost central theme inveterate cruelty around him all left  excuse  bit cool toward frost  i personally prefer musical metrics wallace stevens canny  often pithily wise lines frost 
3,i sadly disappointted book  the postive light robert frost s works always wonderful  yet contents way book actually set confusing  it index contents blantently wrong  their order works poems  plays stories mixed amongest another  i would recommend read robert frost yet certainly frustraiting fashion 
5,jay parini s robert frost  a life   may rehabilitate somewhat view frost terrible person  presented lawrence thompson s earlier biography  see parini  pp ff  some reviews may tend discourage reading frost  thompson s jaundiced portrait this wonderful  copious collection frost contains many best poems  show popular anthologies  and prose filled wit wisdom might suspect  a great contribution art humanity 
5,never thought would need  handy numerous times since bought  quite well made 
1,this book reads like dervative badly written derivative tolkien  married  dark stormy night   the annual contest groaner openings needs new entry  maybe way  ftm could get recognized  books fun read  chore  i tried three different times pick  failed miserably  my last attempt died less chapter  one reviewers used word  execrable   n t  i would have i haunt local half price books snap anything list favorite authors appears shelves  eric flint list  he done nice collaborative work  i looked forward reading ftm  oops  wrong book  i ready give flint  i blame partner miserable writing  i n t think i read roach s work 
2,for enjoyed the philisophical strangler stand severe disappointment  this sequel prequel tps n t measure  forward the mage part dreadfully boring  while story line sparks little interest  primarily relationship benvenuti gwendolyn  rest pretty dull stuff  the extremely long ramblings wizard zulkeh especially trying  the frequent attempts humor forced particularly funny  kind like drunk party thinks s hilarious n t  it makes almost embarrassed read it well need spend lot time  read the philisophical strangler  funny worth effort  you n t miss much except little background really n t needed begin  if really feel must read mage check local library  n t turn late  s worth fine  this book not recommended 
2,related philosophical strangler  stories overlap  book focuses gwendolyn  benvenutti  sorcerer  story events characters  lives    phil strangler  found language bit much wade second time  funny  if loved philosophical strangler  ll probably love  growing weary strangler  probably pass 
4,this movies great follows way thru whole downhill season  ups final race nail bitter whole way  check love downhill worth 
3,fans performers french horn music enjoy rhapsody rondo horn orchestra  this show piece  exhibiting techniques acrobatics horn  but pleasant  exuberant music listen  well performed  it written originally dennis brain  marco polo deserves thanks french horn community preserving work  you n t find recordings horn piece  well worth owning 
3,it noted book contain information planes found video games  crimson skies  jewel case  andcrimson skies   i bought hoping find schematics profile views planes i could build rc model  unfortunately  book really useful fans miniatures game fans crimson skies universe general  still interesting read  i disappointed 
2,though book good plot points  i found overall tone offensive  mr hogan apparently atheist agnostic  believes evolution  in book consistently bashes religion  making anyone religious appear either fanatic inclined towards greed base emotions  none protagonists ever mentions god his place universe i found arguments chironian society riddled flaws  the glaring  chironians place value stable family relationships  sense commitment spouse  never jealousy contention among family members society general  just original chironians came computer programs raised robots eliminate human s genetic leaning toward violence confrontation i read another mr hogan s books recently found anti god bias  i wasting money books 
3,voyage from yesteryear depicts libertarian utopia coming contact sort neo fascist  conservative american dream gone awry  hogan sets premise fairly standard sf storyline  uses platform explore political drama  i disappointed  however  little time spent exploration  instead  hogan s story ends fairly uninspired sf actioner wholly predictable ending  still  entertaining engrossing  somewhat reminiscent l neil smith s pallas 
1,the book starts well  author s explanation social evolution contradicts biological evolution hogan likewise promotes book  this story could good author s scientific semi moralistic inserts  at points i feeling trying rationalize beliefs authoring book almost separate story 
5,one foundations sf examining consequences science technology society  here hogan creates two diametrically opposed societies  earth founded limited resources newly colonized planet chrion unlimited resources  you n t find deep character development book  focus effects technology society  become  telling story viewpoint solders second colonization starship traveling landing planet chrion  hogan explores vision humanity  chrionians value trade respect  possessions abundence free automated factories  on second colonization starship traveling militarized earth  imagine consequences powers character matters  unlimited resources ask  hogan postulates  mind unlimited resource 
4,interesting dvd hard to find footage interesting interviews  must burdon animals fan  however  i little bummed full length performances songs included  also  video primarily focused two incarnations the animals burdon s time war quickly glossed    all though  great dvd i recommend 
3,i adore messiaen s music somehow work n t hit mark  it seems episodic   yes i know messiaen s music built juxtaposing blocks  say  birdsong solo piano  stately gorgeous chords orchestra  etc  works well ensemble  orchestral pieces  so perhaps s something first choral piece written since cinq rechants  i n t put finger  perhaps i looking narrative flow  cumulative effect n t happen despite symmetry symbolism  however i fault gorgeous sound committed performance  i think i prefer turn massive opera st francis assisi spiritual nourishment  better example messiaen s vocal choral writing 
2,this book offers interesting diagrammatic presentation thirty six warships  ranging roman galley  nimitz   class aircraft carrier  naval buffs find useful book  numbered guides accompanying cut away color diagrams offered details layouts various ships  yet selection constitutes  great  warship rather idiosyncratic  the selection exclusively western orientation  chinese junks  ottoman galleys imperial japanese navy vessels completely absent  moreover  compilers seemed unable decide whether great warship innovative historic included selections  leaving others deserving process  as result  interesting resource  limited lacks theme could made truly valuable book 
4,c d pretty kool got latest hits  n t need buy another c d winter  would recomened everyoneso get ur bum buy
4,used replace painfuly uncomfortable original earpads samsung wep200 bluetooth headset re tremendous improvement  great include small  medium large pads ensure custom like fit  if i wouldve chuck earpiece garbage  they obviously n t fit every device maybe taking gamble 
1,save money  the eargels split two days  i used regular ear buds large size  they hold buds ear better  gain sound quality  if small  i ll send shipping  i use 
3,it s probably fault fault product  could n t get fit jabra
1,they n t stay bluetooth   stay work great  so i feel like i wasted money   
3,i bought eargels thinking  different sizes  would fit normal size ear  it turns  sizes package large headset stay place keeps falling  i friends family try results  description read medium  large extra large  i f normal smaller ear n t bother 
4,they work fine  keep jawbone firmly right place  almost comfortable  there  package   sizes left right ear  i surprised worked large   n t gigantic ears    try find works with jawbone  put small plain rubber ring first  eargel goes ring 
5,the jawbone bluetooth headset great little device  unfortunately  none supplied ear pieces fit comfortable ear  i ready return  i decided try jabra eargels  well  i got yesterday  make world difference  the jawbone comfortable fits ear  little piece supposed touching cheek  in fact  good fit i n t even need other the ear hook  the eargels three sizes  designed fit contours ear  shoved held force  why jawbone n t make something like headset beyond  least jabra stepped fill void 
1,i got hope it would give good fit jawbone   work  i think even made less fit 
4,i small ears  i use small  still small enough  but way i wear bluetooth jabra eargel  so work pretty good 
3,product ok  however i ordered the wrong thing  so it does not fit my bluetooth ear piece 
3,i ordered eargels jawbone  bluetooth  product good  i n t like way jawbone sat ear  the eargels worked great  needing ear loops  eargel adaptor ear  pushed bluetooth  i thought looked wierd 
3,good product i figured use  works well samsung wep200 headset  came labels i e  left  right  etc  instuctions took little figure would work  a small piece paper pictures labels would helped tremendously  if impatient daughter would bought would returned unuseable 
2,i misled user review indicated gels would help new jawbone stay ear without hook  the gels would stay ear came headset  allowing fall ground  these may ok application 
2,the service good product n t enough info make wise decision  at i could n t use product jabra ear piece  the item description information compatible ear sets help make better purchasing choice 
1,complete waste money  all three sizes pushed jawbone icon far make contact jawbone i know ears stick   i dumbo though  this waste money  thankfully bucks i went back ear pads came icon   is stays long n t move   not quite battlefield worthy jb claims  
2,these way big ears  even small size large  i usually wear medium size ear gel comes bt device  i using jabra extreme  maybe made device  the gel fit properly device however i force hard hear became pretty painful couple hours wear 
4,eargels replaced old lost ones came blue tooth  fit well got ere quicker expected 
3,you get three different sizes  waste size fits  otherwise durable product  i ve others disintegrate weeks use  product lasts 
2,i purchased eargels comfortable initally stable  unforunately weeks infrequent use icon would fall eargel stored away invarable fell i would replace icon back eargel  so i returned using original icon rubber piece although comfortable least stayed place 
2,with rubber ring place head set seat well gels comes easily  with ring barely stay small size  the medium gels fit best stretched rubber ring  one gel even split wen trying put earpiece back  i trying small i find better solution 
1,i bought hoping i could make bluetooth headset fit better things made impossible wear  the design might ergonomic theory i could stand ear  they seem made thick silicone slightly slippery feel  i really disappointed  stay away small ear canals 
2,i looking forward really comfortable gel inserts earphones  i thought would fit bill  n t long shot  to begin  even smallest size far big fit ears  the large looked gigantic  i good faith recommend  if develop ones sized appropriately  i might give try  i gave couple friends  even said way word work either  what i say  stick inserts companies like shure westone 
4,super fast delivery  the last ear loop jawbone worn  the large ear gel fit jawbone earbud  little superglue  stays  it fits ear without using loops  after full day  ear little tender  getting better i use  i would highly recommend ear gels anyone jawbone  improves sound fit sensor jaw 
2,these probably work great people  n t  none three sizes gave right fit i ended going back factory gel came device 
1,none gels came close fitting ear  i ended using little rubber ring kit jabra bluetooth keep slipping  highly recommended  
1,do not buy from                  sent jabra eargels claiming fit jawbone prime   they  because i days  would back  their return policy stated return days do not buy from                 
3,the eargels uncomfortable wear  not exactly sure exactly fit ear 
4,i using in ear bluetooth devices couple years  my wife daughter  small ear canal clan  opted ear designs fit comfort issue  as turned  neither used ear buds loose insecure fit feel ear hanger design  the jabra gels resolved problem sizing  match diminutive ears     it would nice could order specific size  s m l  side  l r  rather getting variety pack  
4,i used pieces samsung wep200  removed supplied piece slipped  fit perfectly device  holds well ear  creates little bit pressure discomfort  wing  top extended wear  still good product imo 
1,this product ended waste money  they n t fit well i ended using original jawbone ear piece 
4,these really make wearing jawbone lot better  the problem i found buy many get fits right 
2,in odd case poor quality control  package eargels came two six sizes missing others  i bought make jawbone headset fit  it s better  still ergonomic 
1,advertised fit habra stone   n t know changed advertisement since aid package habra stone got  even piece fit  threw away
2,these ear gels supposed fit easily jabra bluetooth i  n t stay placed  i hoping contoured shape would hold ears  proved uncomfortable 
3,the ear pieces fit great sound fantastic yellow i got package  i expected clear colored like advertised picture i needed driving right away  oh well 
1,when i first installed new jawbone ii  fantastic  they fit ear canal perfectly  negating need ear loop came  unfotunately days started rejecting headset  the ear pieces would stay jawbone  would longer stay firmly ear  i tried washing drying thoroughly  helped hour  i sure fit problem  turned work jawbone ii 
2,i bought based reviews said fit jawbone  bluetooth headset  they fit well loose  i use small size fit well  the medium large size fit ear canal  too bad i need in ear bluetooth hear well  i guess i look something else 
4,jawbone bluetooth headset noiseassassin jawbone ii  black   retail packaged  jawbone bluetooth headset noiseassasin jawbone ii  silver   retail packaged  these ear buds fir snugly stem jawbone ii fit snugly  comfortably ear  they necessary use jawbone requires good ear fit good jaw contact work  many  like  achieve fits ear loops buds jawbone in perfect world would jabra gel half way size medium large  either works well ear  i suspect ears would find comfortable functional fit least three sizes sell   sizes  left right package   they cost dollars 
3,i m giving  star rating despite three different sizes  i never felt gave good fit  they soft  still contributed fatigue wearing hour  additionally  i bought ear gels replace factory ear bud jawbone   i never got good fit seal  jb felt unstable wearing ear gels  also  distorted angle jb  needs contact point along jawbone work properly  i eventually went back factory ear bud  less comfortable  functional 
4,i wanted ear blue tooth headset could n t get stay  made work 
4,i hell jawbone i got  i think i need glue thing little superglue  i n t  i keep little pouch purse phone n t matter falls   gluing would fix  but makes jawbone fit perfectly stay ear  earloop  i ve removed dumb earloop altogether  you experiment sizes play around fit first  becomes second nature oh  remove jawbone earthingy  rubbery piece  accomplished easily enough turning pulling  it s little track  turns like jar lid 
5,i bought use place earpieces included jawbone  with i able remove bow goes ear wear ear  the jawbone fall ear  i walk work without risk losing 
2,i ordered ear gels go jawbone bluetooth headset  the problem i see ear gels bulky combined jawbone 
1,i jawbone torture devices  i old jabra mini ear gels giggles swapped hard plastic stock jawbone things  it amazing difference  the minis fit well direct sound ear channel  sometimes fall careful them unfortunately eargels reviewed  you  eargels  minigels  jabra bt250  bt250v  bt500  bt2020  c220s  c250  gn6210  they available jabra    
3,jabra earbuds reasonably comfortable  fit loosely jawbone era  put earbud ear  push era earbud  that said  sufficiently secure i yet lost ear 
1,jabra directed replacement lost pieces wave  these are not i need  meh  gon two weeks i get home return them i n t blame merchant  blame jabra directing waste weeks buying  waiting  returning wrong stuff  swedish morons
1,for reason makers item thought would wise make size ear piece fit different bluetooth  the small fits jawbone  fit ear  the large fits ear fine  fit jawbone  save money find different product 
2,i bought see using gels would help keep jawbone place  none gels fit ear 
5,i really chance use daughter states works well 
4,little uncomfortable way bluetooth headset would stay funny little ears 
1,ordered eargels  exposed time heat  they yellowed sticky  i threw away  n t worth return  wo n t order 
3,the ear gels comfortable fit  tend keep original jawbone bluetooth headset away  the headset side 
4,all i read pretty much true  you remove rubber piece press part attached stay  little tug  a fine line rubber cement fix though  peels necessary  but great thing hold jabra ear without ear loop  and s huge  especially someone like really weird shaped ears nothing else  except head headset  seemed work  all worth cost easily  i wish could order multiple pieces size  if i lose fist ear i buy  pack get i need 
3,the ear plugs comfotable  easily dislodged head set  the combination earplugs headset troublesome put  many times earplug becomes unattached process starts 
3,i love jawbone ii using earloop issue glasses  i first tried jabra eargels worked decently  i especially felt like everything would fall i opened mouth wide  yawning example   overall adequate got job done aliph selling  new fit  ear gels i find i n t using jabras anymore  aliph s fit ear better 
4,i jabra bluetooth i could get ear correctly  it sat drawer never used addition ear gels i use comfortable 
3,these seemed like would really comfortable three size options d think would fit  wrong  none worked could n t use  however  soft touch seem like would great lucky enough fit 
3,i purchased ear gels go jawbone  found unnecessary  read several reviews going well jawbone  they big ears  thus made jawbone far away 
5,i first looked cookbook another lady s kitchen  she earmarked i could tell tried many recipes  i knew lady great cook  i ordered  i m pretty picky cookbooks i keep  this nice  i love seafood recipes  a classic 
3,the movie certainly good enough purchase  i n t agree reviewers  fabulous   as pointed  script could use help  i liked cast  armand asanti wonderful lead role  isabella bernadette always fun watch  stunningly gorgeous vanessa williams  and  course  eric  they took thumbs   roberts  poor eric underated  for movie made  sure skipped special effects  the effects cool enough  razzle dazzle  even  s good flick rainy saturday   really n t go wrong 
1,the special effects film wonderful  debate  armand assante seems like s sleep walking movie  it loosely follows poem parts suffers severe lack passion  compare film s  ulysses   despite poor effects  much passionate inspired portrayals characters kirk douglas anthony quinn among others  even classic scene involving argos ommitted modern creation  ugh  on flip side  athena s portrayal isabella rossellini actor playing god mercury fun watch  the odyssesy   still   enough story justice 
2,i watched movie year i read book  the movie switches story lot acting dissapointing actors odysseus  penelope telemachus  main parts talented  i would show child give taste odyssey  read book planning  watching ruin flavor odyssey 
3,i viewed video i thought true original poem  i disturbed creators chose place death heracles  known commonly us roman hercules  trojan war  occur actual place  the acting decent  best use depict monsters greek mythology exciting format 
2,originally would give horrible dipiction the odyssey star  last scenes ugly  telemachus  threw two spears  give two stars  everything horrible opinion  the accents kept changing everything  if read book watched movie  would thinkt joke  so anything read book  so two stars two stars thrown ugly t
1,i never disgusted  sickenly entertained  movie  i actually read odyssey  i like poem  after reading  i decided watch movie  there almost no accurate allusions poem  the characters  acting skills elementary school kids  scenes obviously fake  i feel bad homer  must spinning grave  the fact got   stars appalling  i feel sorry humanity  believing  nonsense  work homer 
5,this oddysey great anyone sense adventure likes greek myths  it well done great cast characters  the movie summary adventures oddyseus go order get back ithaca wife  i highly recommend movie give five full stars 
4,the oddyssey  know  originally epic poem written ancient greek  homer  if interested ancient greek culture  good movie check  i ve read poem much context movie poem  the order storyline differs still close match  i ve re planning reading the oddyssey  check movie  it help understand poem better 
5,the movie wsa filled action lots special effects   i loved plot sory meaning full 
1,watching movie read book pretty much hell  the fact changed whole plot book makes seem like joke  then  special effects  made even worse  even n t read book n t know real story  movie still horribly directed filmed  there transitions  actors n t seem realize movie together  they accents thing common characters playing book names  the reason anyone ever watch movie complete boredom need make fun something 
5,i think movie the odyssey  great  you would think movie special effects would really bad  wer n t  the odyssey  called odissius  he wife penelope  but day oddisiusses born go trojan  the story many twists turns goes jorney trying get back home 
1,this biggest piece drunken hoopla world  i n t believe people would actually time daily schedule watch  if actually read the odyssey  movie nothing like real thing  i strongly suggest read book first  well  anyways  going read review thus rendering review useless something clutter internet even already  i am the anticrhist 
1,yes  yes movie bad  really bad  bad homer still alive see  would something similar tv mr n watches boston public  but bad beside point  who really cares people class writing mr n s ideas  if i  i would flattered know people beleived strongly enough ideas time write amazon com  to everyone wrote review horrific movie  didnt criticize people s reviews  good  i hope future express disgust movie without competency honors student questioned someone n t even tell us  but  lizzie mcguire  hehehe  i must going  i ll see periods    andrew
2,i n t see producers bothered making movie  it adds nothing kirk douglas version ulysses made  besides limited cgi effects  even douglas s beard preferable assante s mullet hairstyle version  this stripped sex violence original homer what tv movie madex format back  finally released dvd cash troy  blockbuster  it made acceptable us tv market  i suspect production team european to knowledge  yet good film tv adaptation odyssey  the best dramatisation far recent audiobook dramatisation bbc starring tim mcinerney 
1,this comes close worse piece garbage ever privilege view  the acting   horrendous    cgi   poorly done  do favor watch roman version odyssey   ulysses kirk douglas  it may oldie  s definitely absolute goodie  
1,i totally agree andrew   way  people dont know us dont really know whats going   please dont waste time movie   re better watching old reruns whos boss   even though deprived cable wouldnt know   probably know
3,those english first langhuage  hard hearing  deaf note production company bother caption film  inexcusible day age  particularly since subject often covered school 
2,special effects sucked ve seen good special effects special effects odessy crap comparison lot movies ve seen pretty crap  realy boring      ve seen weve seen heaps realy gory coulda been betta     
1,this movie epitome  well  everything wrong movies  it took premise adapting homer s literary classic completely butchered   osbstrocity  with acting would pale comparison elementary school play  script would make ed wood blush  words special effects ever  truly makes sad humanity the good point makes great    jokes  telemakhos s double spear throw become running gag school 
4,i teach engish freshmen read the odyssey part curriculum  this movie version well done i enjoy showing students   they enjoy  adds   it stays pretty true version read monsters  gods  etc  portrayed well  the hesitancy i regards circe calypso  there brief sexual innuendos situations two women  story  generally story provided freshmen anthologies  however  freshmen level  s completely within boundaries show  watching movie adds dimension written word  provides opportunities comparing contrasting well  i continue show 
3,being fan homer  trojan war   i watch flick  however  i somewhat disappointed overall treatment story  although props  part  seemed historically correct  writers make changes deviated homeric epic  for instance  battle scene ahkilleus death hektor far removed actual lines  kind like reinvented  helen troy   from recollection  since i ve yet find video see rerun yrs   ulysses  kirk douglas  far  best rendition odyssey 
1,as detroit red wings fan  i must say i loved version odyssey  this special effects absolutly wonderful  i must say i love acting  best ve ever seen life  almost better sergey federov acting get hit draw high sticking call  there action chelios misses checks  oh  holes movie curtis joseph leaves net  this movie wodderful
1,nbc miniseries tells greek hero odysseus  played flatly armand assante  boring adventure film features unlikeable characters  routine action scenes  lack spirit passion  this builds surprisingly bloody conclusion  given tv roots        
1,everything movie baaadddd   from everchanging accents  fake special effects  cyclops looked fake took away movie   movie flawed became entertaining look flawed parts actually watch movie  yeah  movie sucked 
4,i really like version  especially since really versions work literature 
4,this movie much fun watch  it originally made tv  watch without commercials re able get full effect story without interruptions  this based story the odyssey homer follows story fairly well  some adventures left  unfortunate  main part story n t feel wanted it the acting good tv movies  special effects  they re cheap looking something tv movies problem sometimes  the costumes good sets  you feel like re traveling around mediterranean trying find home the ending felt little rushed though  i felt could spent bit time 
4,first  adaptation the odyssey  as director said featurette  omitted lot direct philosophical discussion poem focused action story line personally  i m glad  this enjoyable movie throughout movie re waiting see odysseus return home  and every setback faces  keep thinking ll get next time  only see happen  the acting pretty good overall  there notable lapses skill cameo people like bernadette peters  though  but thankfully small segment  this dvd n t really young children  too much violence  especially end not many extras dvd  story s real thing  eh 
2,like reviewer jueichi shen said felt like took length odyssey watch  i thought movie agonizingly long  hours minutes  i never watch  headed public library status tax deduction  good special effects  though hence  star rating

4,these earliest monks christ s admonition  sell everything follow him  heart  with deep austerity  prayer follow path utterly dedicated spiritual life  despite austerity  times surprising expressions personality  even community among solitaire cells companionship monks  there stories hermits lions companions  sustainment herbs palm leaves  helping thieves stealing  selling gospels help poor  however monks humble faith  lesson often repeated stories humility compassion temptations feel  the temptations women  even monks  expression pelagia  harlots  beauty surprisingly sensuous  it may seem impossible us isolated like  quest solitude abbot antony said  who sits solitude escapes three wars  hearing  speaking  seeing  
3,i agree review c ryan   one really needs compelling enlightening material   it s okay read  probably offer historian looking tidbits insight day to day lives desert fathers  spiritual seeker hoping find spiritual snack 
3,this book ok introduction  otherwise disappointing  there many books much better  helen waddell translate writings latin  the problem save first selection st jerome  originally written latin  selections translations latin latin translations waddell translates translations authors original greek still  exposed thoughts beliefs early christian monks may good brief introduction  you get look early monastic thought lived lives  of course translation desert fathers find words wisdom benefit 
3,gerald durrell written quite books  including  life young boy greek island corfu  this middle book trilogy funny two  my family other animals in garden gods   he relates various stories childhood involved ranging far wide island observing collecting various animals  birds insects  the stories pleasant interesting  laugh loud funny like books  i enjoy it i would n t recommend middle school story contains pretty graphic detail peasant woman giving birth 
4,i eagerly read  my family other animals   i enjoyed immensely   it contains stories omitted  my family  offerings still magical wonderfully well written sometimes hilarious  especially story turtle   lacked memorability predecessor  there real structure order stories  miscellaneous collection 
5,i read gerald durrell s books years ago  i still living romania  i loved books first page last literally i could n t put i finished  the best humour i ever books  his stile unique  i planning reading english  i would recommend anyone

1,this book bad  period   it incoherent ill organized  the examples vague serve anything support material  very theoritical hardly real life applications  lacking modern ai topics game design 
1,in phrase  nauseating  artwork  besmirches cover  this book definitely worth price  donate money instead city s homeless instead  you learn much ai actually contribute something world  of course  cover makes great prank cocktail parties  place someone s drink look like beverage spilled winston s book disorganized  pretentious  he writes mind authority philosopher mind   fact  s programmer  winston books go history works others  doug lenat  made fame primarily something easy anyone else got around it real ai yet 
2,the software nice work  simple use usable none less  the problem i ve encountered software notoriously bad encoder memory leaks wazoo  if try encode large movie file mpeg premiere likely crash due bad memory management  the solution far simply restart system pray would n t happen  although experience seems workrd time try  i tried two brand new machines new xpbit install expereienced issue 
1,google instrumental wipeout  read real story  i love surfari s version got   billboard charts matter weeks 
2,after contacting seller item never received second shipped  when got mirror fallen housing  we n t wait additional month get replacement glued mirror back housing 
5,great solution special space  i know difficult hang things modern ceiling  this item  solve problem  installation fast price great  seller fast delivering item  good job 
2,i bought excellent review another customer  picture format   ashame  though quality picture good  good encoding  beautifull skin tones  pitty lightning director creative used awfull backlights gobo s  the sound ac   dolby  never impressing  low dynamics  it s regular tv mix hear  s remixed dolby  s extra dynamics lfe output i feel band average  the directors cut average tv special  all way  would n t recommend 
4,enjoyed immensely  the sound best stereo  the dts  mix done poorly imo  but  stereo sound good 
5,after using psalms now bible study litergical prayer i decided try contemporary christian worship setting  the response phenomenal  whether used basis prayer traditional liturgical style helpful book bring psalmists words life 
2,this book wilbur smith s early books shows after reading books set ancient egypt  i bought thinking would good read  he spent much time relationships little time meat story search elusive diamonds  i able finish disappointed particularly ending  it ran steam got hurry  the ending book left wishing would given little tie loose ends  not bad book  great either 
2,terminally boring predictable able finish  i would rate monsoon early courtney triliogy   stars 
2,this book falls bottom five books i read wilbur smith  there review african continent prevalent books  no intermingling diverse peoples populate country find books  here nothing greed sex without purpose typical family squabbles to knowledge diamond mining never done fashion africa 
4,we read original book  half story  long enough little work page magnets my favorite thing book teaches lowercase letters  mastered uppercase ones already   useful tool loves work magnets  it easy confuse b  q   d  p  mould  different colors  
2,what disappointment  i n t believe cheaply made book  i glad i got sell i would returned  the caring case zip lock bag  the pages easily ripped  the pages plain paper put mental page behind story page  i could cheaper full version book  the magnet letters very tiny  it really n t even worth sell price  i m home daycare provider i really feel ripped  shame makers book  the wonderfully made magnet learning books top that  including counting magnetic numbers  magnetic play learn  i wish i got books instead
2,having seen versions  first peck ahab  i would lean towards original  the new version patrick stewart s moments  peck father maple looked like daze n t know   peck s performance rather disturbing  the actor played quee queg newer version like cartoon  the actor s version far convincing patrick stewart n t bad choice ahab  like stewart playing ahab v s  being the character  i kept expecting shout  engage  rather  there she blows   for students book  original version closer text  this new version far many added bits purist  if enjoy remakes   i n t know  go  if stickler detail  pass
3,i watched movie children read wishbone version story  they fascinated  the violence right family viewing eight year olds found mesmorizing intense  i thought could better  whale n t realistic  fine made tv movie  i found perfect family viewing 
3,if really see movie  i recommend rent n t buy  it hard stay awake get entire movie  the last minutes practically parts worth watching  patrick stewart hand played excellent part usual  i bought movie i caught last half hour television looked great  if i known   
1,if see movie moby dick  see john huston directed version  screenplay ray bradbury  this pitiful excuse movie made people knowledge new england  whaling  whales  herman melville s epic novel  the grand poetry  vivid imagery  theological symbolism fill  moby dick  missing shell film  even stewart s performance disappointment  khan star trek ii better job spouting ahab s venom stewart s anemic portrayal the additions story meaningless  chinese harpooners  queequeg s  blah   noises  ahab s family    omissions puzzling  elijah  and rubber whale  unscarred  unmarked corkscrew harpoons  ungrizzled  unbarnacled  flight gulls  well  looks like rubber whale 
3,i saw version moby dick ion television network  i seen original movie read book i must say  verision holds true epic journey intense obession previous incarnations  the visual enhancements allow us greater view bane ahab s existance moreso movie therefore allowed us feel challenge terror facing huge beast s element  moby dick s willingness turn attack rather escape diving deep  gives almost human quality retribution would harm  patrick stewart s ahab appear  insane  gregory peck s  intense way   bit frightening  overall  stewart gave excellent performance maintained story s classic status 
5,the original moby dick book cases better movie    s true    actors  instead patrick stewart  normally really love  role good  tooo nervous toooo crazy   n t sypathize roles   e g  starbuck  ismail    whale stupid awful  like low budget film   could much better   s worth buy watch     s opinion   bye enjoy time see moby dick
2,dont bother crap  it worst worst  movies i ever seen  it bad acting  story boring  i dont understand point movie  terrible  dont bother 
1,what waste  hours  nothing gets accomplished  you watch terrible graphics  watch everyone  n t even kill freaking whale  that made mad this film accomplishes nothing there point movie do n t waste time  money  energy leave  quickly 
3,patrick stewart incredible actor  i love character star trek star trek movie finishes quote moby dick  quiet  passionate speech alone would stand agains borg  i expected movie but patrick never reaches deep  intraspective level  he almost realizes driven mr starbuck contemplate murdering  the tension mr starbuck capt  ahab powerful  it almost  quite  i might editing problem  it could director problem  not sure movie fell short   mr starbuck plays part well  emotive personal  he brings alive  can longer follow god follow capt  ahab   tempo rhytm movie n t keep necessary tension 
2,if looking different version classic  moby dick  fine  personally i thought fell short mark  the highlight gregory peck made apperance preacher  the original still 
2,i know hard bring book like moby dick screen  least john houston tried s  this made for tv adaptation makes wonder screenwriters director even read original book  not character queegueg depicted incorrectly mauri new zealand  reality melville based character nuku hivans   treated buffoonish stereotypical  savage  completely odds dignified character melville created  additionally  filmmakers dreamt bizarre scene pequod stranded ice antarctic  they must reading mary shelly s frankenstien time  patrick stewart s performance ahab however  wonderful  s redeeming feature overblown mess 
3,this strange version moby dick  patrick stewart s ahab thirsting revenge point obsession  instead  stewart plays ahab straight insane asylum  the dialogs ahab starbucks must attempt create play like  stylized dialog  instead  came across lot mad ravings  i ve read book many times  i viewed ahab obsession  street lunatic happens command whaling ship  abducted aliens   sorry slam stewart  i love actor  he indicate press interviews insecure playing captain ahab  i guess shows  i however  wholeheartedly compliment maori actor piripi waretini plays queequeg  favorite character book  ted levine fine starbuck  this film  though interesting bold attempt  n t capture real sense moby dick 
2,i found recent remake classic weak  stewart s potrayal ahab n t power gregory peck s character the camera work terrible  land clearly seen several scenes supposedly many months 
4,the fellow said patrick stewart hammed much  i actually liked part  i read book  mostly  everything ever wanted know midth century s understanding whales     limited action book  but i thought pretty good job creating movie around action book  followed story well  i seen gregory peck s version ahab  i thought patrick stewart made good madman 
5,just like movie produced book  compare book  certainly fall short  if movie context dramatic movie made enthrall couple hours  ll find movie exceptional  i watch twice year find better movies personal collection 
1,it seems several different versions tv movie available  rumor movie originally broadcast usa came  hours  laser disc version movie minutes long  vhs version minutes long  unfortunately  edits made vhs version extreme  abrupt  awkward makes movie virtually unwatchable  you n t help feel re missing something 
4,patrick stewart handles ahab admirably  gregory peck minister giving blessings warnings outset provides continuity version played ahab two points consider  queequeg played considerable energy earthy humor  actor risks veers close  john belushi  homage  charms    i found english subtitles  us need help hearing  contain unacceptable number errors  simple misspellings  e g    thoudsands    thousands   text appears transcribed notes non native english speaker  heard his her ear written sound   i highly recommend amazon contract editor review english subtitles  edit appropriately  amazon find way insert corrected text  the errors distracting i would even ask amazon send corrected versions request swap out   
3,i love heater  warms bedroom i like settings thermostat  but   uses began leak clear oil  fortunately i wood floors n t stain  i would furious i carpet ruined  i called manufacturer told i ship fixed expense  fortunately amazon much accomodating  i hoping i got lemon replacement problem  bottom line  great heater watch carefully leaks 
4,this little heater works far better i d hoped  i tested toughest space  x glassed front porch  for three nights  outside temp right  the radiator highest setting kept porch temp  in  smaller  rooms getting cozy heat big deal  the noise makes occasional  low  click  i d given five stars dial easier read  handle sides instead 
2,had  years  it n t much look  n t heat strong delonghi trd0715t  but worst started leek second year   not recommended 
3,goog product  packaging survive shipping  both heaters came damaged i return back cancell replacements 
3,its ok quiet not impressed fast heating  takes bit time i knocked accidentally heater cut electric cord right half    
1,the description said usually ships  business days  well s month i another month go i recieve item  do n t believe descriptions  i ordered  weeks ago delivery estimate november  if cold need item year n t buy amazon  it probably n t arrive february  it s going  months delivery  just warning 
4,typical ms smith s work  story hush apple empire n t help wash reader s heart even brain disconnects story s plausibility  well  really n t matter fun  romantic read  afterall  writer supposed good imagination  right  ms smith especially good developing characters  flaws  this writer never disappoints true romance reader 
2,i ve read several deborah smith books  in opinion blue willow best  sweet hush far corniest book  i ve read long time  the phrase  sweet hush  must used least times book  the main character  hush  predictable dimentional  if enjoy deborah smith books  i would skip 
3,sweet hush enjoyable read  although lot far fetched  well written  i swear i could smell apples 
5,it s long time since book kept week night  sweet hush kind read  i loved characters  i loved family  wondering going made un put downable book  wish d make movie story  i already casting head 
5,i acutally bought kindle fell love quirkly little story i turned around bought hardback book mom  deborah smith given us wonderful cast characters believe family family business  they love  stand  anything protect  i know plot review readers  let say  n t matter genre reading  story draw keep entertained  it wonder story terrific read 
5,the authors takes time explain basic hypotheses statistical mechanics  i believe excellent introduction field 
2,i thought terriable book  makes nice companion reading mcquarrie s book  mcquarrie skimps explanations instead leaves reader figure solving problems chapter  one usually find answers  least hints  within book 
4,twenty five years since i ve seen classroom  i burning desire pick i left  what i needed good introduction i could find  elements statistical thermodynamics  k nash  excellent little book   so i tried chandler s book  modern beginners text  for true beginner  i d suggest  intro  to thermophysics espinola  wcb      after espinola  go hill s book great bridge bargin going chandler  hill s style clear examples given condensed treatment  not problem solving book  good book physical understanding bridge forward goal 
5,if intrested studing statistical mechanics start  hill starts defintions postulates thermodynamics moves applications problems  you need understand diff eq book the first chapter took week read work math i red rest  weeks  it hard start hill develops background starting applications theory  i really began grasp subject reading book  ohter books lay mathout well hill  it hard read hill thorough  rewasd well worth struggle  it great introduction i suggest hill s stat mech book  another great bargin dover press at price i recomend graduate chemical engineers chemists
4,this ancient stat  mech  book lot old topics  most chapters   i think  directed towards chemical applications  i think book mcquarrie even  chandler better know little stat mech already  much much worse know nothing  this book really cheap i n t think go wrong getting  the explanations pretty good mcquarrie  though i n t always like organization hill 
4,this textbook statistical mechanics course i took years ago  the single greatest feature book compared many texts statistical mechanics related fields clear presentation sort intuition behind concepts  that alone makes worth buying  and s cheap may well buy 
5,an excellent text book physical chemist get sound footing statistical thermodynamics inorder really get good view basics statistical mechanics reader really needs spend adequate amount time digesting contents initial chapter  however  spending amount time reading initial chapters  grasp latter parts book quite interesting fashion in opinion  book must master statstical thermodynamics  infact  would really amazed standard book considering fact reasonably old  no new standard books  statistical mechanics  provide adequate foundations book  i would strongly recommend book along book statistical mechanics  author sasisanker padmanabhan
4,i picked book used couple dollars vacation spent rest vacation reading  i rated book  stars even though i found enjoyable  i seemed easily figure plot heading  nevertheless  i still surprised ending  i found tension hester monk intriguing frustrating  especially resolved book  needless say  i delighted discover  soon  books series  i plan read 
4,i keep short point   plot characterization brilliant writing inserts repetitive analytic asides almost every page   good writer indeed use technique enrich story perry succeed quite nicely times   problem totally repeats ideas little added information many times  if perry rewrite novel remove pages baggage  would best detective novels ever written  still i highly recommend book 
4,introduction series obviously became rather popular  this offering peaked curiosity enough read second series  however  i stop 
1,ms perry s depiction post traumatic head injury completely irresponsible  she apparently research  amnesia type describes exist  thus  underlying premise book unbelievable  even infuriating  anyone basic knowledge brain injury  in addition  monk s investigative skills virtually nonexistent  his interviews informants suspects fragmentary incomplete  suspense built  action nearly absent  eventual solution anticlimactic  laden turgid prose  book absolutely dreadful 
3,the entire william monk series anne perry must read anybody interested historical mysteries  it absorbing well written  i excited see recently  i e  past years  ballentine books re publishing entire series paperback  while covers absolutely beautiful  unfortunately  paper use book mediocre quality  further  given print painfully small  poor choice font close typesetting  becomes difficult read particular reprint book  the new paperbacks definitely worth   price tag  i little surprised since random house publishing group reputation quality work ballantine books divisions 
2,having heard author speak radio  works praised highly host  i decided start first monk series  unfortunately  i found main character thoroughly unsympathetic unlikable  the story slow molasses bits pieces useless information thrown fatten book  also  i n t know clinical features amnesia  seemed monk s memory loss selective inconsistent  the ending highly anti climactic fate characters question never revealed  i much looking forward reading books  sorely disappointed 
5,william monk awakens victorian era london hospital amnesia  over course book  returns job policeman  hoping work help regain memory well detecting skills  what s fascinating discovers life accident flattering  including fact may well responsible serious crime  over course perry s new series  book debut  monk s past various times haunt  delight  maybe even endanger  people allies n t always like  loyalties another shine  as pitt mysteries  anne perry s trademark detail eye opening descriptions victorian life really like make entertaining way read away winter afternoon
1,to start  movie lacks direction  build excitment  rising interest  little action  i love van damme movies especially actioners types i found desperately trying stay awake  watch movie alot time hopelessly squander 
2,lets cut chase  if better damm movie  watch retreat surrender  as one save day got nothing better do its time killer  if sitting around lets get point watch need time killer  if movie sickest fights watch guyver  yall love it and shelve 
1,bode well movie  the actors horrible story flat  do n t get wrong  i like jean claude  movies like timecop bloodsport pretty good  the fighting scenes black eagle n t make lame movie though 
1,totally fake  unrealistic  plotless  i love action movies  n t action  you could see missed punches fake reactions  i n t believe anyone would pay money movie
2,i would say plot good  action fighting scenes favour action movie goers 
2,first  van damme fan  movie definately see  must seek joy seeing damme  hard damme fans hate  for  movie feels like columbo epidose  dramatic music  film average  showing plot  fight scenes action  the biggest action scene explosion small wooden boat chase scene cars going fast mph  plus dvd features limited no  making    feature  theatrical trailer production notes  short   could done dvd features region code free dvd 
1,black eagle released months van damme became star bloodsport  the film could made van damme wash luckily n t  the martial arts chorography film sloppy fight scene sho khogusi van damme weak  skip
1,i must admit i m big van damme fan  still  i try keep open mind  not sound terrible  obvious punches checked  would made comedy plot n t boring  i think woody allen could make better action picture attempt 
4,i m write reviews drives crazy people put movies re similar others  i really enjoyed van damme movie  i see getting put similarities blood sport  yes similarities but s movie  i gave movie  stars entertaining kept full attention entire time  there plenty action scenes i loved plot  definately a movie to see   
4,zaller turns perception polling data ear  people n t think issues asked  opinion surveying might actually shape opinions actually report 
5,i read book class school well written  this book informative recommend reading 
1,my  indoor  contracted fleas month ago i used zodiac spray carpet  upholstery  curtains  mattresses i went treating apartment  i used zodiac sponge bath   treatments bottle  used  course frontline topical medicine  today i brushing found fleas  my vet informed heard nothing complaints owners ve used zodiac products the label claims   one treatment gives continuous protection pre adult fleas  months   i used spray generously i month later right back i started just treating  bedroom apartment fleas costly tedious task  if re going go  make sure use best products available  talk vet explore all options  good luck 
5,very gald guys back  debut album hallows eve s brutal  hard edged  pure thrash way ment  when i think pure s thrash metal sound i always think hallow s eve first three glorious albums  solid release  worth every cent  m m 
1,this work enthusiastic encouragement guidebook charismatic renewal among lutherans  however  offers dangerous theology  for example  suggests s okay make mistakes first trying prophesy  everybody needs practice  however  contrary scripture  god takes false prophecy seriously  unfortunately mr christenson 
3,this case hubby  i m using told review  as far hard case  works great  there sort bow bag bow goes first inside hard case  another thing said straps hold bow place straps hold quiver place felt really needed  overall  s happy case  happy hunting   
4,bought case amazon gift card got birthday find chain sporting goods store  price  great case ideal airplain travel prefect season storage 
4,it interesting read the foxes harrow   senior citizen  since i early teens first time i read   enjoyed   book  it quite sensual  considering year written  it held fine years  i probably understood nuances better adult teenager  frank yerby brilliant writer  book presents balanced view white slave owners slaves faced pre civil  i could n t help comparing gone with wind i read 
3,you may get idea cover masks inside intricately made cutting folding multiple sheets paper  however  exception mask shown cover  made single sheets  any  d effect achieved almost exclusively shading prints  apart  simple triangular cuts made corners mask dome slightly rather lie flat  i found disappointing  i d recommend book young children  definately nothing offer adults origami enthusiasts   
2,the cover book makes masks look intricate impressive  on inside  look cartoonish  for halloween costume  i success blowing photos noh masks photocopier cutting eyes 
2,two stars only s bad book  long re merovingen nights fan if  bad  sol s basic plot characters  well incidents major minor  lifted straight previous series  a minor adjustments adapt setting  alternate italian renaissance  instead wonderful complex world mn n t improve story all it s thing  little predictable considerably dumbed down if enjoyed first version  annoy pitiful attempts change enough details pretend s hashing book ve already read if n t read original  book spoil you bad idea whether author s publisher s  bad idea shame 
4,yep  reaction i first heard girth book  i tend believe n t write good story pages little bit  n t write good story period  i stopped picking book pages authors i n t already like years ago  and even though i really like work lackey  flint  freer  weeks go get read  i read two half days  better pace many book half s length  the characters worth reading matter fell drawn  the world little harder adjust run mill  dreck    stuff usually based northern european mythology english norm german french thrown culture  scope   not good read put follow s top portion must buy list 
2,this book disappointing  it many major characters inadequately developed many plot lines follow  the magic awkward add in book could well written without the first half book s plot  several characters  setting closely resemble c j cherryh s merovingian nights stories  much better 
1,mercedes lackey favorite authors  this book let  much nothing  the different plot lines written different people tell picks leaves  irritating style there many characters s easy mix  some characters never figure novel all it s bad i spent money book i could purchased mercedes lackey novel without help 
2,i tried couple times read book  each time i stopped half way  it dragged places ok others  s definately mercedes  usual standard  the book finally wound  donate library  pile 
1,i ve longtime fan mercedes valdemar series  so  course  i picked book local store  after wrestling pages  i gave  i plan sell back local store asap nothing better paperweight bookshelves  the worst part  boyfriend picked tried reading  now thinks good example work 
2,when i read mercedes lackey book i expect happens someone book  there real  enough  the people felt like shadows  without true substance  reasons  actions  i could n t find reasons cheer anyone  one problem many people follow easily  since many none drawn richly enough draw world 
5,i m normally likes alternative histories  best  complex lackey books i ve read ages  the characters  always  depth humor  plot fascinating  question  sequel  one word caution  read c j  cherryh s merovingen nights series may find many aspects plot strangely familiar  
4,this book n t much like mercedes lackey s normal writings  n t point collaborative work  i m giving four stars bit hard get first character list extensive  it sometimes difficult remember  even glossary  i found write notes glossary record thoughts characters motivations  the plot constantly twisting enough humor without making book silly  i ve read almost every book female fantasy sci writer  quite well   found delightful change 
3,i avid sf fan book hard follow first  to many different groups charectors  after finally figure book exciting good  will another  if people patient learn love book 
3,i read book mercedes lackey s previous books  even ones co authored  it seemed though set rules character named  one person would go first another last confusing  content wise fairly good  but i said best i read author 
2,i n t make half way book i gave  it seemed go    i usually like mercedes lackey  every  makes bobble   i think book whould lot better either two books greatly pared book 
1,mercedes lackey contributed series i ll refer merovingian nights series  set universe invented c j  cherryh  mercedes s original contribution merovingian nights series far better read  the shadow lion major disappointment  mention i could spent money wisely another book  there warning posted cover flap reader read merovingian nights series  book offer surprises  shame ms lackey 
3,this novel borrows substantial character plot material merovingen nights series  c j  cherryh     new characters situations  the setting movedth century venice  although alternate timeline library alexandria saved  magic exists along demons  people caught political struggles rival empires  city states  rival families  vendettas assassinations common  all complicated demons underworld trying control feed people s souls the setting entirely clear beginning  necessary read chapters get clear picture situation  after  story becomes interesting  it easy set aside reading early chapters  i stayed late finish book i reached final chapers  overall  interesting story 
2,i devoted fan mercedes lackey  i read nearly books  book far  least favorite  tempted quit half way  didnt  helped  alot things seemed completely irrelevant  made sense  main problem story way many characters  hundred  hard keep track  even  it alot plot  story  difficult keep track times  its bad read    busy  many many many characters  it ok read  i expected 
4,being huge fan green carnation agalloch  i decided pick album  heart of the ages  album time  honestly  album seems like exactly would get cross two bands  impressed  yes  overall album pretty awesome  the dark atmosphere perfectly created  the female vocals opinion better male vocals  a five star review question male vocals fact impressive  at times  i impressed background elements i wished male vocals would stop  overall though  album great purchase must fans agalloch  green carnation  katatonia 
2,   but nearly enough counter negatives first positives  some brilliant photography  one n t get around this   some truly likeable characters character development  especially several minor characters there  that two stars worth  negatives  spotty directing  offsets quality photography  no earthly resemblance  true  book story supposed taken  a boring  over the top gay agenda  along number similar  far left  issues  poorly cobbled together  a view virgin mary   openly portrayed offensively film  bound  nonetheless offendin short  bad outweighs good  skip 
2,honest i expected little movie  mellow somewhat boring 
1,as previous reviewer said  pulled every single american cliche italy book  pretty much i expected  but oh gawd awful  i laughing hysterically  as bad low budget miniseries 
1,hey gang  let s pool resources get rights mystery science theater talk us  i m telling would surpass even manos  hands fate sheer yuks  the cheese  schmatz  dishonesty  cluelessness  pretention flick begs  begs put misery 
2,having read under tuscan sun three times  movie disappointing way beautiful story became run mill chick flick  as beautiful scenery  movie made tuscany lose s charm warmth i received book 
5,what great movie  entertaining enjoyable  funny moments great acting diane lane  the film beautiful look bigscreen story beautiful avoids cliches sentimentality  a great movie  very recommnded indeed   stars 
2,i eagerly anticipated watching movie  i thoroughly enjoyed book  however  movie shares passing resemblance book  it gets  stars i enjoy diane lane tuscany gorgeous  movie dull  lane s character nothing short pathetic  ending trite 
4,fun light  bit unrealistic  just let go enjoy  diane lane sandra oh great  linsay duncan steals movie 
1,it terrible  living italy many years  i hated see exaggerated stereotyping italian  seemed real bad hollywood interpretation a room a view 
2,i pretty darn cheesed movie  it s definitely nice look  diane lane lovely woman  however  characters sugary sweet cheeseballs  diane lane s character spine sandra oh great  usual

3,not sure made movie n t anything going warrants whole movie made  i found rather boring compared movies genre 
2,i really enjoyed book  i disappointed movie  rather story italian countryside adventure remodeling home foreign country  movie divorced woman looking love gay friend s dramatic life  blah  i wanted see charming polish workers quaint italian villages important part original story  oh well  n t movie 
2,unfortunately  screenwriter completely changed story under tuscan sun  true  main character buy villa tuscany  however  story primarily concerns diane lane s trauma divorce trying find italy  the film little trials renovation villa  most importantly  film says nothing book s description life small tuscan village people live  i disappointed film

5,so entertaining enjoyable  a masterful beautiful comedy heartwarming inspiring  beautifully acted shot  wonderful   stars 
4,this movie warm toned sincere  i really give lot credit film makers create romantic comedy contrived unoriginal  under tuscan sun fresh romantic comedy heart of course masterpiece change perception life leave breathless  leave smiling least half hour over also  really good point  so many times force things happen lives become totally frustrated process  it indeed much easier  fall asleep let ladybugs crawl   you see i mean watch movie highly recommended enterntainment

3,the movie istrue to lifewhen comes  uglydivorce  butin tuscan  italy magical things happenand  happiness  aquiredover length time  thescnery astouding 
4,this feel good film  diane lane wonderful job playing woman leaves behind everything starts new  the people meets  scenery  neuroses charming way  where eat  pray  love failed  film succeeded  a woman sets find personal disappointment  rather whiny arrogant character julia roberts eat  pray  love  diane lane s character relatable warmth energy despite situation  highly recommend film rainy day 
2,i thoroughly enjoyed watching another t v  show playing family room  the wife got good night sleep n t even bother replay part missed  after complaining  hollywood video gave us comp   felt like got money s worth 
4,i thought movie great  if faith hope things movie  diane lane great i hope gets oscar nomination roll  my boyfriend even liked movie says alot s picky everything  if n t seen i suggest  i liked much made actually get book read i big reading books 
4,yes m guy yes enjoy chic flicks time time  me this good film diane lane  best known great performance unfaithful  first flim recall main staring role i n t get deep story recent divorcy  feels n t go living san fransico   gay lesbian friends convince go gay trip tuscan  italy  while becomes intrigued year old italian home  mind nothing works  pretty sad shape so hires contractor s help project  along way runs various think ll develop attraction maybe never pan s out so thats ll give  watch yourself although seems little slow places s entertaining little piece film none less 
1,i watched movie reading book  the movie bad i felt compelled read book see could redeem  the characters depicted movie dimensional i n t happened  the book tells totally different story depicted movie so much better 
5,a truly magnificent movie  diane lane shines role frances mayes funny  sweet  enjoyable piece great entertainment  the director makes movie engrossing enjoyable impossible drawn wonderfully realizedd characters brilliant played scenes  the scenic locations help likable characters  make mistake   magnificent movie 
4,this beautifully filmed romantic movie woman searching meaning life life turned upside husband s infidelity subsequent divorce  it moments humor well emotional intensity  it well acted part characters believable parts  and scenery truly stunning  my husband accompanied see movie grudgingly  but actually watched entire movie  laughing funny parts  movie admitted enjoyed  children interest movie  great couples 
5,a great actress beautiful scenery  it good watch woman coming growing strong devistating loss  women love watch least 
5,this great movie  views tuscan towns scenery make hop plane italy  the movie content funny  entertaining  travel advertisement 
5,destined favorite well  i m sure  it everything chick flick   romance  finding strength  empowering substance  if n t think could survive life s pitfalls   movie give strength keep keepin   funny  entertaining  ensightful empowering  movie bowl popcorn bottle wine away classic 
5,superficially  movie indeed sappy  however  look beneath surface what i see diane lane s character playing superego  sandra oh plays ego  and fellini fatale playing pure id they play part explain love  despair  dissappointment lust the buying remodeling old house like cleaning cobwebs upstairs  clean house move something new in i believe movie made representing flat shows you it good psychological study human mind ups downs goes lifetime 
2,if diane lane  movie would total loser  it s swindle  it s advertised  romantic comedy   little   comedy  it s boring  portrays italians cliches available  blegh 
2,this title amazon recommended list  since i never heard i decided pick up in short  i think any movie would benefit set shot tuscany italy  this  without beautiful backdrop  i n t think i would watched whole thing  a patchwork story line  left feeling lot interesting bits pieces but appeared put together apparent reason it n t believable maybe rent
2,man  hardly i watched movie long  hour minutes  portrays leading character every  i mean  every    single scene  every single second whole movie  this bonus diane lane fan   the woman simply gorgeous  besides good actress    otherwise youl imersed chick flick along  bad way  lead absolutely nowhere 
4,this wonderful movie experienced loss  pain  road amazing good things happen     life  i loved movie bought copy sister  hopeful  married  romantic  very insipirational moving  would recommend best friend 
4,this movie dreamers world  it sappy love story i looking  inspiring  even though n t totally belieavable  made feel great woman  diane lane wonderful  talented  sexy woman great role model women 
5,wonderful story woman reclaims life  great  feel good movie   i love dreams true 
1,i rented movie highest expectations due things i heard talked  like funny romantic wonderful scenery  what disappointing story  the story sense direction  it seemed badly glued together  scriptwriters saying    ll make divorced woman   ll make go gay tour   oh wait  let s make morals sex n t known even day   lets make flirt real estate   all  story turned pretty stupid nothing admire main character 
3,after reading frances mayes two wonderful books  under the tuscan sun bella tuscany  i disappointed felt let film  i found real ms mayes significant other husband ed real life italy much appealing un real ms mayes  dianne lane  un real life italy  the film eye candy due settings cinematography expects get  real story  story presented ms mayes books important  forget 
2,this might ok movie watch weekend re bored absolutely nothing better  of course s nothing like book  it s terribly contrived unlikely scenes  for example  s scene long haired chinese shows extended visit girlfriend dumps actually gives birth  that n t happen real life   guys n t get pregant  yet    anyway  forget movie  read book 
1,was very very disappointed   movie though brand new  box stopping time latter part movie 
1,first  movie nothing whatsoever book except title  that said  diane lane plays someone supposed sympathetic s sociopath  really  looks serious  think s kill someone  when s happy looks like  then fact nothing happens movie realistic  except  someone like cameron diaz title role  d probably even enjoy  i feel used cheap duped watching movie i m longer going waste time dl s films  she n t deliver  if plays black widow  i ll watch  if plays another sensitive caring woman  i ll hurl first 
2,the story probably wonderful love story   get must suffer paper thin character woman depth  self  mind    actor portray woman worth watching worthy real love 
5,i n t know  seems lot people n t like movie  why  because n t like feel good feeling  i mean  sure  usually book ten times better movie   movie least four  when read book  movie comes based  n t expect good book  rarely  even movie lord rings n t good book people  and look movies like harry potter  ella enchanted  bourne supremacy    lot movies n t better book  so  read book  thinking seeing movie  advice try expect much  think movie seperate book  by way  i rated movie five stars i think people lighten  watch nice  family movie change 
5,iloved this movie     the widescreen dvd version really takes in the breathtaking scenery  and the beautiful colors in the landscape  this movie really drew me in from the beginning  and it really brought out emotions ranging from sadness at the beginning of her divorce  happiness in when she begins her new life in tuscany and meet the  eye candy   anger over how she is treated  and teary eyed at the bittersweet ending of this movie  yep  this is definitely a keeper       i really do n t understand some of the more negative reviews of this movie   have no distractions  relax  and let tuscany take you away    
1,this fun movie like romantic comedy why star   there scene old woman calls ayoung german couple  facists   the irony  old lady italian  whoever wrote scene n t i history book iguess  that s little predjudice side n t belong comedy  i m glad couple n t african american  i wonder would called them do n t support garbage buying  loan library 
5,i enjoyed story scenery tuscany  it makes visit  
3,great art direction  sceneries fantastic  diane s acting little lacking  i thought last scene little superficial 
3,if something relax couple hours good movie  there funny parts  moving parts  i would consider movie re invent going difficult time  many unrealistic things happen  definitely better movies i ve seen  certainly worst either 
5,if like romantic movies  perfect  but  please n t cry  it gift someone else  eventhough i personally seen  it arrived time i could keep track  via ups   since i purchased puerto rico 
4,this movie love romance  italian culture  scenery diane lane reeeealy easy eyes  this sweet story woman rises emotions heartbreak find love people places finds italy  the supporting cast excellent scenery artist s dream 
5,one absolute fav movies  it s rich looking makes go tuscany  i wish blu ray  colors would even amazing  watch blanket bottle vino 
4,this good movie  it misfortune coming around time julia robert s feminist mona lisa smile  sometimes confused film critics  this feminist  male bashing movie  and n t entirely chic flick  either  diane lane apparently picky roles plays films appears  this another good choice her there plenty reviews telling film  i ll simply tell i bought dvd wife  i usually watch  it good movie 
4,i know movie n t book  said  s good movie  a movie revolves around redemption  discovery  love  in short pains joys life  a life best enjoyed lived  truly lived  well acted stunning photography  worth watch  n t expect verbatim re telling book   n t 
4,the scenery film breathtaking countryside  house  people  food way life general inspriring what made movie great  though  romance frances marcello  in typical romantic comedy  broken down lonely frances would marcello problems would solved  the  but film  frances thinks life turned around found answer prayers   but  like real life  case i liked movie n t sugar coat anything  time uplifting 
3,i really enjoyed watching tv edited version  i little taken aback language 
3,it really nice parts   photography  scenery  good character development  three quarters way  though  i thinking   where going  ever   i enjoyed much  got dang long  it nice way brought around  gotten sooner 
1,i m goof  i automatically assumed format dvd north america region  i excited came  i opend package went straight player watch  opps  i discovered pal format readable player  though  i aware many video formats  i still assumed dvd like dvd blue ray i pruchased the pal countries like japan europe  i confirmed findings i red back information dvd package good thing i adopted daughter france  like dvd  it s format     please carefule purchaseing video s amazon   read carefuly format country else may disapointed 
4,a review lists several stereotyped characters movie  honest  s fair critique  but diane lane good actress  tuscany beautiful  similar central california  i understand california  mediterranean  climate  i able forgive clichés fact i could basically stay step ahead every plot twist  i wish shown transformation villa   this old house   ok  maybe i wish shown little ms lane s body  so honest 
1,maybe clever enough figure actresses  directors  producers  etc  still circulation this film boring boring boring insult everyone   except perhaps far eastern looking  actress  gets play  friend  protagonist  fairly deliberately ruins supposed night stand  one night lay precise  anyway  part slow  dark looking italian hod  hunk day  abbreviation  he he   do n t worry  bearded  rugged looking american going fill italian s rubber shoes   sorry italianizing americanizing enough going film  least dvd version the film forgot elaborate potential dangers adult owls snatching kittens though  s romantic  realistic view world  definitely meant horror flick  then  scenes pure horror 
1,this boring movie wretched performance i ever seen diane lane  all sigh first minutes 
4,yes  chick flick  italian backgrounds scenery make wish  diane lane easy eyes well  my wife enjoyed much forced book us mediterranean cruise italyth anniversary 
4,i gave movie  stars good movie  however  quite depressing times  diane lane n t catch break  it kinda slow  i m pleased seen 
5,this great fun movie  it funny touching  yet did nt cliches   it well acted diane lane looked fantastic  a great fun movie  highly recommended 
5,determined rebuild life sudden  unexpected divorce  diane lane gets away going gays only excursion italy falls love  house  she buys delapidated villa renovate quickly fills engaging cast characters  she finds dreams  love  sponsoring star crossed lovers   family  pregnant friend  jilted lesbian partner  finally hopes romance  more  chick flick  movie offers little something everyone  including exquisite cinematography  highly recommend 
5,i n t say enough positive words movie it good show like alot things second time home much better  it dvd gift daughter  night i watched noticed little things often miss large show  as women i could idenify frances many way s  when leaves home loved goes tempory apartment  lays floor  it diane s best friend performance  viewer grow love laugh  but important message movie france s positive helpfull attitude towards everyone beautiful tuscany 
1,i may read description dvd n t play  states wrong source  in small letters box says s uk version  ca n t fiind receipt i n t return  i really looking forward sharing someone special   
4,i thought good film i puzzled reviews i seen  some hated movie many liked yet i wonder many really got point  this film could easily evolved italian travelog actors succumbed facile ending  instead moved unexpected directions everytime seemed know would happen next  it really captures joy spirit italian people without actually making focal point  the handling people locale excellent never became actual point movie  however  ending really sets film apart  film builds conclusion careful wish might get  and usual get asked god way providing unexpected ways  i thought subtle entertaining film  i seen twice enjoyed times 
3,review film  came uk i came theatre high hopes  i n t expectingrealism  i go see subtitled italian film  endless stream cliches finally wore goodwill  the encounter marcello rushed thin emma thompson much better scorned woman diane lane the writing could much much better i hoping italian amelie  left severelydisappointed 
4,entertaining story  unfortunately  people n t kind money rehab property another county  italy lucky someone brought   invest  improve real estate 
5,i saw tv  i  i love watching movie  i watch every yr  
1,i hated dismal movie  not completely  course  diane lane  villa  italy builders lovely  story dismally surreal  first divorce  lesbian couple  gay tour bus  promiscuous italians  breakups  nice pormiscuous fellow writer  yuck  there romance movie  romantic  s biological twisted womens pre menopausal angst bedroom problems  and bedroom problems n t enough  get everbody else s  what happened nice normal romantic comedys audrey hepburn style 
1,this window italy  rather american contrivance italy  cliches abound  comedy forced  i disowned claim even mildly enjoy movie  questa film  merda 
1,easily  worst film year manipulative  ham fisted  sloppy  insulting mess movie imagine chick flick parody  the simpsons   ll get pretty close  add strange pc garbage good measure  close bad soap opera episode btw i like diane lane tuscany  nothing redeem gross pathetic caricature i ve learnt lesson though  audrey wells work avoided costs 
1,i read reviews wasting  bucks bb used dvd  i bought wife  she wanted see i write review i watching think movie fairy  please  please   movie sense reality i would first move italy  enough  read others said specific  i want my money back 
1,from onset  movie stilted poorly developed  while diane lane wonderful films   character  irritating best  the plot trite  hollywood drivel  some costuming lightingwere well done  i d like two hours back  this definitely going donated library people canbe tortured free     
1,i rented movie husband town  looking forward good chick flick  by middle movie  i could n t believe i still sitting   i wanted   back blockbuster  the story keep attention pregnant friend got worst actress ever  i recommend 
2,diane lane gifted actress started recent times  i realise good scripts n t plentiful actors  diane left alone  i agree another reviewer diane s facial expressions film  quite annoying  full every cliche possible  film allow think even second  on top  every scene seemed stolen another movie the scenery thankfully movie s saving grace  watch alone definitely disappointed 
2,dated  does n t tell  beat democrats    old  worn advice  save money buy something else

1,i saw movie theaters friend brother  i expecting exciting movie exactly not  the movie n t make sense really n t plot  do n t waste time money movie 
1,the movie vague plot  meaningless items   like facial tattoo   loud  annoying soundtrack frequently overwhelms dialog  the additional injection non english conversations  translated occasionally  simply adds confusion  no real resemblence either novel original movie  i d find minutes shopping channel entertaining 
1,im begging not watch film cost  it awful thing  cant bring call film  shoddy acting horrendous set design fake  boring scripts ever  if really buy i suggest purchasing pure pleasure watching burn 
2,i surprised delighted see  remake   after purchasing i  well  disappointed  i guess framework story nothing else  the modernisation action poor  story ok i n t find engaging except scene  a satisfying ending story nicely wrapped i think cast deserved better story line sticking original concept real remake modern cinema techniques could made four star candidate  oh well i guess ll never see good modern updated version certainly 
1,the temptation re make movies evidence fact little creativity hollywood  this movie evidence people hollywood allowed go movies let alone make them the original great  fact original interesting photography stunts  this version insipid point stupidity  photography stinks  stunts mostly cut and paste special effects the people made banned association movie making life  so i buy  by mistake  i copy original thought comparison would interesting  i wrong  learn error avoid like plague 
2,the original original  this  event motorcycles original  come 
1,do n t waste time money remake  even rebecca s hotness n t save  watch original james caan 
3,everyone really seems hate film  i think s pretty entertaining film  i n t compare original film i n t seen original  i judged s merits  the rollerball scenes suitably chaotic exciting  klein  stamos ll make pretty good leads  though i n t like ll s character suddenly rmeoved film  jean reno good over the top villain story compelling enough  downside sometimes directing weird looking  like night vision car chase near  s pretty entertaining film 
1,the old saying hollywood never lost money underestimating intelligence american people really hits groin head shaker release while orignal classic rollerball n t even gotten anamorphic dvd release  let alone blu ray 
1,the setting movie future     it current day  takes place poor european country  the arena skate looks like cheap prop american gladiators  there very little special effects high tech equipment minuets movie done night vision camera  everything see either dark green picth black most action happens within rollerball arena  there action sceens streets city 
1,  rollerball  theatres awesome  bone crunching  action packed movie  but got video  dvd   added nudity  took scenes  it terrible  the camera work even altered came video  i would n t mind least put theatrical version video   bet n t  what happened when they tranfered the film 
2,this film major disappointment  i expected much director freaking  die hard   the direction  acting  writing joke  this film left feeling thrown together  took seriously  there lots things film n t make sense  someone explain  why desert chase scene filmed night vision  what in the heck was up with that   the editing choppy scenes thrown together  i gave film two stars reason  the skateboarding scene beggining sorta cool  thats it skip it   rollerball  loser 
1,nothing say  worst movies ever  bad script  stupid story  terrible shooting  boring acting  i highly n t recommend title 
3,the brave new world n t fake  blood andstunt men   rollerball deadly contact sporteven simulated camera  sort dirtierversion world wrestling appears theother reviewers n t stomach fortelling like becoming violence sex media gotten handand remake shows level escalation  the romans bread  gladiatorial games circuses  tv  american social decline recorded video allthe generations see  i think maybe vampire moviesand common ground ofblood drinking 
1,what heck  this movie rated r  the theatrical version rated pg  now i m allowed get see movie  mediocre begin  great job 
3,while certainly film contender best picture academy award  i found enjoyable picture  certainly better many i ve seen year dvd  the film s opening sequence enough get adrenaline pumping watching  jonathan luges hilly streets san francisco once movie goes asia  n t exactly much pulse pounder  certainly lot material formulaic  still  unlike  the mummy returns    the scorpion king   film actually plot  special effects  turns pleasant piece mind candy  i never seen original  i m sure film stands comparison  but merits  worse ways wasting two hours time 
1,this grotesque despoliation classic film  essential elements background storyline properly established  there scenes whose purpose within overall structure simply defies understanding  the nighttime escape attempt  sequence shot bizarre green blur extremely unpleasant watch  hideous music plays frequently nail coffin film poverty in game action sequences  these generally nothing confusing melange images  the transitions camera shot another seem poorly done really impossible follow internal dynamics game 
1,this movie worst films i ve seen years  the script horrible  movie little glitches  big scene movie shot night vision  green   if thinking buying movie  read review  i d give movie stars  minimum star 
1,this far worst movie i ever seen  the plot impossible follow  action confusing flashy  film editing awful  for example  sequence motorcycle crashes chain link fence sound effect boingongong heard  like spring snapping  ridiculous  concept  terrible  acting  worse  execution  rollerball looks like made  weeks using  computers didnt work  i reccommend see movie  tell friends ve seen worst movie ever made 
1,this somewhere worst movies i ever saw  its hard find faults movie full them i horrified poorly first rollerball game scene shot  it uninteresting almost impossible follow going pathetic  there doubt mind first fifteen minutes worst intro film i ever seen it got somewhat better weak plot developed less action shots playing ridiculous game i normally something positive  none  none all i must admit watching whole thing   sucker punishment  i would never watch  could never recommend film anyone a real letdown
1,not many films make feel stupid actually watching  movie  despite starring ll cool j  generally happens least make stupid films entertaining  film falls far flat almost bows creates ditch  chris klein horrendous actor manages muddle nearly everything comes contact  matter hot rebecca romijn stamos  romijn   n t bring anything film outside body  n t cut  the violence cheap  script preposterous action sequences feel third rate  this films offer us absolutely nothing i nothing else say 
2,this tedious unnecessary remake james caan classic little recommend  director john mctiernan  well die hard  blasts us heavy metal rock garbage throughout entire movie  action scenes incomprehensible lifeless  cast fizzles start  chris klein s good looks n t help vapid  uninspired performance  ll cool j surprisingly uneffective  rebecca stamjin stamos better blue make up x men flicks  jean reno laughably miscast russian owner mctiernan films lengthy chase scene appears night vision goggles  green things  it makes creative sense adds nothing overall movie remakes like add validity fact re going remake movie  either make good better  let us savor originals 
1,this movie plain sad  in addition mediocre acting  special effects bad  in scene could plainly see safety wire connected motorcycle  bad diologue senseless nudity made film even worse  the plot resolution could solved little sooner  they came lame chase scene airplane cruising ground motorcycle  maybe last ditch effort make movie little bit exciting  the slightly interesting character played ll cool j  his camera presence always rather captivating  it carried poorly written character  since movie took place track  game i could really put  avoid 
1,a complete waste film start finish do n t waste money if must see  rent it this movie n t need remake  original starring james caan fine one star generous 
4,i ordered  based reviews  i ordered  received  i needed   i love musky smell  i tested drop wrist  i say couple hours  smell turned strong sex smell   bad  definitely sex  i m going test work next week  real test  i ll report findings then   it works  this definitely going  go to  scent  it drove crazy  i love  i purchase

2,poor quality fabric  soft like flannel  but    s guest bed  i guess s ok 
1,i extremely disappointed fabric color came  it obvious poor quality i guess get paid bucks the zipper plastic cover set broken i bought  queen sheets i wanted return purchases i pay shipping do buy     you regret 
4,i think great re nice soft  that said i m picky others  picky abpit certain things sheets n t 
3,the sheet color inconsistant  the top sheet s background color goldish tan much darker bottom sheet s background color  i m assuming came diffenent dye lots 
1,i like product  got really cheap  this quality product  avoid higher prices
2,i high hopes sheets even though i got bargain price  they n t elastic around  problem flannels resulting sheets riding sides  they inexpensively made many loose threads potential unraveling  they thin flannels go  all  try find better quality sheet    s well worth  
2,i bought  sheet sets  i noticed two queen size sheets stitching holds elastic apart several places elastic falling  i washed sets two times  i disappointed purchase 
2,i ordered sheets hoping comfy flannel sheet i remembered old days  snuggling covers fall winter  cosseted soft sheets  perhaps  i optimistic  given price these sheets seem fairly good quality  n t fuzzy softness flannel  there s really much nap  they made low thread count sort jersey fabric  the patterns good  packaged nicely  high thread count sheets available affordably  sheets disappointment if like jersey type sheets  n t concerned softness right package thread count  could right  and n t beat price 
3,these sheets light weight cheap way  since i paid little  cheaper keep rather pay return postage  i n t bothered even use yet i n t say sleep in on  if i could  i d spend little money buy sheets better 
2,the pillow case seam tore wide open initial washing  i even used set    i stitched back rest set seems fine  could anomoly  beware  but   
4,i bought this set for my year olds bed  she gets tons of comments on them they are very comfy  very warm she loves them   they are a great set for the price
3,the sheets pretty  quality lacking  not soft flannel sheets  i would buy kids camping  used  every night bed  the comfort softness missing 
1,dollar store quality  lovely dark pattern  printed thin white flannel  over printed blue yarn dyed fabric  stitching fairly dark sheets white 
2,the hems flat sheet became unraveled first wash  places  full length sides  however fabric soft touch price insanely low  i gave courtesy second star 
3,   asian children must really sweated  labor concerns aside  sheets job worth   however  right mind would pay retail price felt first hand these soft enough nothing luxurious  the top sheet runs narrow quite long pillow cases small side  the sheets fit queen size futon average size pillows i d recommend getting king size shrinking wash the print nice  i pleasently suprised  earthtone colors keep way girly  with green blue cover could look classy even work well 
2,even incredible friday price    i would recommend flannel sheets purchase poor sewing workmanship  the stitches large  edges simply turned sewn raw  easy unravel  edge  the sheet would hold well first washing  i resewed edges sheets 
4,the sheets seem fine packaging looks like something would see  dollar general   they looking cheap  big deal really unless giving gift 
4,this movie everyone  i love absurd humor  every character irrational way  where films today would probably mock characters mean way  film sad sweet acceptance eccentricities  it respects courage human beings obviously damaged hardships life still continue muddle  just like real life

2,from pictures  etc  thought trike somehow means locomotion  swaying back forth  my determined child never figured  instructions never hinted technique  so  ends scooter functional s hard balance side scoot foot 
5,this book amazing  it provides us great humor taking serious look religion whole  personally i think great god om best character whole discworld  followed close second rincewind death bringing third place  i hope see sometime soon  maybe another discworld book  course   this book best villian whole series far i m concerned   really truly evil  in short   i loved it     
4,still well worth reading  whether looking something light edge long day work something little heavier pose interesting questions  small gods discworld novel i ve read  i n t compare rest pratchett s work  grabbed attention held  it s many layered book  pratchett n t force reader go deeper feel like  knowing latin asset reading  say adult things leaves implied english   also  book n t either  british    american  feel  much fantasy falls  overall  excellent 
4,i ve read quite pratchett books  mostly insistence year old loves novels  this ranks right among favorites  intriguing allusions many world s religions  the author clearly well read  catching little references produced many aha  moments  i confess i even lugged home compendium world religion paralells little obscure references  alot book meets eye  well   i find complete sympathy conclusion  thus truly satisfying narrative start finish  i add approach reading book drove absolutely crazy  fact taken value  references allusions book still great read 
2,terry pratchett s books lot like well painted homes  there several layers   small gods  like inviting friends paint  there uneven coat paint left masking tape edging unsuccessful attempt miss paintbrushes  the ending book  middle beginning truth known  left vague feeling dissatisfaction i realized get place properly painted i would another seperate group friends throw another paint party  
5,it entertaining well written discworld novels  the basic philosophy nature religion brilliant  much credible closer reality official dogmas existing religions  actually  quite close nordic paganism  practiced iceland   traditional shinto  official version practiced japanese state  religious taoism 
5,i ve read nearly disc world series thoroughly enjoyed ones i ve read  small gods holds special place heart  the characters engaging  om little turtle completely  brutha  naive i could relate  what villian vorbis  pratchett best usual terrific humor  addion  upon rereading i keep discovering  much much story  it invites us think question  if read terry pratchett story i recommend small gods 
1,okay  i read book fantasy lit  class i taking  my teacher fellow classmates  seems  find hilarious  i  however  left wondering   i understand s getting religion  i ve seen done much better way much better authors  the characters boring flat  his humor downright stupid  this book clever least  if n t know things s pointing way suggests thinks quite witty  really need think yourself i guess might appeal great masses find nothing better time go next big blockbuster movie buy latest crap novel  but  back book say popular author  like things popular  must accessible public else n t understand 
3,although i love book  i get something  it okay read  fast enough  cute enough  smart enough  but book i fell love would even recommend i read others books pratchett i say i enjoyed  this i easiest time  i plan reading  i gave chance  books i decided taste  its 
3,i agree concept polythesim  may god  fact gods get power belief worshipers  although people may find book satanic blasphemous case  pratchett treats whole thing sense sarcasm  seriously  although quite witty places  i think book better suited avid prattchett fan  
4,let say i m big fan discworld  i n t give solid reason  never quite captivated way many  pratchett s writing good  world entertaining  well    i n t know  just n t much  maybe much satire  enough story   small gods  different  it pretty good story  and satisfying  this first discworld books i read  s still favorite  admittedly  i n t read many  grain salt it drag bit  great  pratchett convinced cleverness  but usually s justified  when comes right  best humorous fantasy still something worthwhile say 
5,if slightest inkling takes professional author  read terry pratchett  this s worth reading  i n t think aspiring writers learn anything prose  patently false  do read terry pratchett chapter  feel like kid toy xylophone staring beethoven head symphony  pratchett truly great writers today  vivid imagery beautiful wordplay unparalleled  in small gods  pratchett follows discworld version spanish inquisition  creates story managed make laugh chapter caused genuinely think nature religion  belief faith  i know i m using hyperbole  i know i m raving ridiculous extent  but small gods earns praise 
4,i expected lesser douglas adams   terry pratchett novel  things pages read quickly  laugh couple times change book second hand stores but  small gods  thing beauty  seemingly superficial thoughts nevertheless takes depths human condition  pratchett mayve even intended reach heights art  attempt succeded  could well presence minor classic here book explains gods made destroyed  fantasy world  real  deux ex machina 
2,i liked  characters alot ideas  what i n t like plot  bored  the reason i kept reading see anymore ideas  i love ideas  especially books like mort  colour magic  light fantastic 
2,i read series great delight  however  pratchett finally let down it plods along  particular hurry let reader move better things the humor  little  forced  it feel sophomore philosophy majors sitting round quad saturday night  dateless full mockery  it kind sad far best  pyramids  series watch wondrous three witches  enjoy far more this droops limply ayn rand novel 
2,while ideas lay framework book solid  everything else lacking the humor forced  awkward  occasion plagarized  a nearly verbatim quote monty python sketch stands mind the plot slow seldom rivetting  the thing kept turning pages points search origin  remind me again how the horse shaped ones move  quote the character development poor  the main character  brutha  makes sudden transition bumbling idiot sagely leader of men bargainer with gods  i n t convinced the ideas  however  salvation book  read good imagination   ll need make new story around concept pratchett poorly utilizes 
2,the last line review comes first  if find church humor church esque situations  including lot parodying church ideology customs  funny  either due inexposure  like  much exposure  fundamentalism   book not you and review  i love terry pratchett  favorite author time  and i picked book hoping would become favorites the fact  i n t find much book funny this novel moves along snail s pace  terms plot humor  the chief reason disillusionment pratchett includes lot church analogies novel  the characters church characters  and god godly  over half book came across particularly long pointless conversation dullard favorite stuffed animal overall  i wish i d review warned thusly   last line review 
2,although book intentional attack organized religion past  thought went far trying humor audience  in light book fiction  pratchett still wanders little far even joking something important millions people supreme power even  comedy good throughout  characters little shallow times  obsession imagery fantasy novels  see guy gavriel kay   made feeling bit disappointed huge phenomenon terry pratchett 
5,tabasco chiapas s  nice place either live visit  greene s explorations provided background characters great short novel  the power glory  if student fine writing  read novel first  read see gathered used material  or read first background adds depth novel  if armchair traveler student mexico  enjoy greene s adventures grateful went n t  this truly classic travel writing

2,i picked book b  n  i read two jane austin novels i thought would light read  i wrong  the beggining purpose story middle could much  much shorter ending made little longer i liked character mr bounderby  he well developed  i would even say over developed   how sissy influence youngest gradgrind  why n t know mrs bounderbys inner turmoil ran father  every character something missing  what happened mr bounderby found  why sissy special really family  it long book nothing much happened last quarter finally ended i felt cheated lacked complete story line full characters  the story line could forgiven i satisfied characters 
2,i picked hard times preparing enjoy since charles dickens favorite author  while going far say i disappointed  i say first charles dickens novel i almost felt like finishing  not plot rather humorless  characters charmless almost uninteresting  if hadnt written dickens i may liked better dickens usual charm humor 
2,this book terrible  half characters ending main character apparent  then  i m freshman high school may little inexperienced judge harshly  i personally dislike dicken s wordy style writing s easy get lost  if like dickens  n t mind writing style i m sure would probably disagree  i ll give two 
2,charles dickens art literature s music  made intolerable robbed beauty  the dicken s aesthetic excessive description drives reader tedium makes wish dicken s payed every word saved instead every wrote  his knack wrapping loose ends nice neat conclusion overshadowed time effort takes reach point
4,readers always remember reading  instead usual monthly periodical installments room spare   hard times  done weekly installments limited space allotment  newspaper  household words   dickens found combined pressure time space nearly intolerable  given breadth depth vision needed social reform  one imagine much better  fuller  satisfying book would  plot  character development  dramatic impact  dickens written pages two years  rather pages five months 
3,hard times feels like book dickens polish nearly much many classics associated  it s story unhappy lives two children father raised speak appreciate  facts   imagination  fantasy  passion  like forbidden household their lives unhappy  d expect  but lack much narrative interest  the usual twists turns fate dickens invests characters  lives mostly absent  as result book drags  hard times lacks humor found dickens books  pithy observations different persona time  so  reading uninspiring narrative  find wishing something  anything old dickensian magic  alas  show up if dickens titles re set reading  read first  you re likely enjoy 
3,i needed book college class  it shipped quickly great shape i got  also  affordable  much cheaper carriers  however  i would recommend book pleasure reading  i personally enjoy dickens 
3,i totally n t get book  ordinarily i like dickens i simply could n t figure event  i understand  however single segments  especially louisa  interesting  it even funny reading beginning book mr gradgrind teaches imagination useless facts important  if fluid book type story  read great expectations  favorite book certainly makes sense  personally  favorite dickens oliver twist 
4,a interesting book   downer  might expect title  the story begins issue might happen children raised setting non logical human qualities repressed  this blended relationship dynamics factories make factories actually produce something sell  further  related issues added  these various topics intermingled moving story 
5,book excellent condition service excellent  it s seller s fault book boring 
3,charles dickens greatest writer time  unfortuntly n t tell hard times  not bad book  average writer pretty good  i agree n t usual humour kind flat  its kind subject book  know  mainly deals parents put kids imaginations  i like though  n t memorable 
2,this dickens best  no offence narrator  good job i think story rather boring  especially compared classics  great expectations     a christms carol    a tale two cities   
4,for english class  i read charles dickens   hard times   i chose book i read several dickens  works  i enjoyed  i find works good  thought provoking books free cuss words  violence  lusts  i think book realistic account life like early nineteen hundreds  i glad mr gragrind came around thinking realized okay fun  i glad book ended  i glad see justice preserved  overall  i think good book  i would suggest read  i enjoyed 
3,still bad story  rather depressing books  little make enjoyable read  dickens usually  also  little subtlety  dickens point  facts everything  life practicality  hammers point home repeatedly  making little effort allow reader feel clever discerned author s point  most characters caricatures  possible exception louisa  flaw unusual dickens  writing  seems noticable blatant better stories worth reading  excellent 
3,the title says  it ok  better products  like weapons card shark jeff wessmiller the problem dvds essentially teaching perform false shuffles cuts  n t address best ways detect moves 
1,did n t like book  for several reasons  hero ben seemed weak especially allowed mother slap  like years old    unbelievable    heroine way dependent upon daddy  type backbone    the biggest  ben knew truth yet create angst parts    yuck  
3,game enjoyable experience  fact time i done playing game  i blisters size pancakes thumb  the reason game s character movement done d pad rather analog sticks  since combos mostly divised sliding thumb pad  will hurt awhile  overall  good game 
3,this good fighting game excellent graphics  nice stories  good extras  it lot different characters  however  game muchd feel  insteadd  someone mastered certain combos certain characters king fighters series  find mechanics n t work game  it still good game  though  certainly advances story number characters 
2,it s another king fighters game  do n t already enough already  it s like drastically different ones it s basically game king fighters date attached title  means people notice  realize s brand new  buy immediately  why continue tormented like  in world already loaded enough tournament fighters  i say find something else 
3,while fun times game feels unpolished  some characters clearly meant powered  alba   it s interesting see characters workd environment 
4,bad azz dope getting better everytime hear  however opinion beats track selection halt progress terms album sales flava  his first album good suffered album fact many tracks sound laid back really lacking alittle liveness crunkness even though maybe style beat bad azz chose describes ghetto struggle well  the best tracks streetz illustrated   wrong idea  how we do it  afew others close behind  if bad azz include afew tracks like albums start really shine  buy album still  good tracks phat

2,oscar winner timothy hutton stars spanish made film he plays science fiction author david norton  he invited island conference  he takes girl friend  asks marry hima dvd appears room commits suicide and people start dying  he usually control  suddenly life takes nasty spin hutton takes lead weak script  the plot wears thin first minutes starts drag  there plots  the suspense film feels disjointed starts bore  there thrills capture audience  towards  hutton looks bored lead film falls aparttry miss video store  good films rentedbennet pomerantz audioworld
2,the  stars goes timothy hutton great performance  truly outstanding actor  but   movie   well great  i left somewhat disappointed  it starts well gives impression good movie evolves bizarre scenario completely fails keep suspenseful tone start  fact rather wearisome inconclusive times  it s trying really hard achieve goal poor script   i expected s

3,after reading reviews anno dracula i could n t wait read  afterwards n t quite sure fuss  at times seemed author trying pull every character  real fictional  period possibly could  made book difficult follow distracted development main characters  the book quite descriptive gory almost gratuitous violence  definitely book i would read  i interest sequels 
3,it n t bad read   little weird sometimes  book vampires needed weird  having queen victoria suicidal consort count dracula little much  imagery good detail well written  all  vampire fan  go 
5,consider might happened england dracula survived stoker s novel  this premise upon newman s story built  fortunately  knowledge victorian history literature matched brilliant ability storyteller  newman best 
1,i really book  i found plot messy muddled  many clumsy devices scenes felt forced  climax  particular  seemed rushed  cinematically speaking   the characters  part  thin  perhaps author reached far casting reference net  i wanted like  i much enjoyed alan moore s tales extraordinary gentlemen s league    a intriguing idea though  i give acorn golden prize oak grew sickly    maybe thing  
2,gee  i n t impressed guys  i found quite tedious  bram stoker s original kind  this even remotely league  sorry 
2,too many characters appear sentence two vanish london fog lateth century 
2,unfortunately  s two left feet occasion  i bought book i big fan holmes dracula stories  despite sometimes colorful characters  tedious read 
2,this book needed  opinion  least two hundred pages longer fully explore ideas brought  i liked written cameos famous vampires historical figures  i n t like ending  the killer i thought real let  eventually caught  and way dracula presented   ugh  not good all i guess re really bored desperately read vampire novel   otherwise  steer clear book 
3,purchased amazon suggested  yes  jack the ripper vampire new spin vampire stories  no  i n t much enjoy  kind slow  gripping anne rice 
4,many reviews already laid story s premise characters  i feel duty comment last pages  deeply haunting unforgettable  in pages  detective protagonist finally confronts prince vampires  kim newman shows true wizard imagery  dracula s court mixture bram stoker s vision hieronymous bosch painting  leaves undelible mark reader 
2,too much filler  none characters unique  much book full boring conversations went trite details  dull book  skipped large parts 
1,this book needs grammar check  it incomprehensible  i trying return  it sucks  coin 
4,i m quarter way interest peaked troughed peaks   the array real fictional characters often amusing relationships other the entire premise  refreshing vampire facelifttroughs   parts quite polarised  particularly concerning genevieve bit confusing keeping part several characters similar names  maybe s   it dipped bit i thought i might driving silver knife  i stuck i look forward times i read it kim newman s concept brilliant 
3,i saw book recent list naming best vampire novels last century  having read others i found compelled read it anno dracula rich  character filled novel  set england  story happens dracula n t killed helsing  friend s rather survived  went marry queen victoria  now vampirism runs rampat  dracula prince consort  add whitechapel murders  jack ripper  many extra characters  fictional  non fictional   anno dracula i really enjoyed book however occasionally laden many characters  i lucky newer addiction index defined people  characters  names author referencing i would liked seen dracula  queen victoria  said ending powerful presence i recommend book especially like alternate history 
5,the seller presented title accurately honestly  the book arrived timely manner  tact 
3,after hype book foreword endorsement massad ayoob  i really thought book would teach something new  it n t  i expected nice primer tactics exercises  instead i got bunch rudimentary safety lecturing rehash obvious well known ideas rules handling firearm  if never owned firearm  book may teach something  if firearm proficiency   drawer time time practice range  n t waste money basic boring book  this book nothing helping move towards decision go ccw really even defend home  except short chapter  common sense stuff anyway  an average book nothing new 
4,this first book i purchased becoming chl instructor  i impressed lot information within book  however  quite typos   could lead credibility issue author information dealing high stakes issue 
4,i little disappointed book  not information  i found interesting  construction book bad  page printed place page included afterthought single sided page stuck pages like book mark  i great respect massad ayoob wrote foreward author  david kenik  however i little respect publisher obviously read pre press proof  again  good information  poor construction 
3,i find i agree reviewer sarafin  this book many production errors caught publisher  apparently print run identical errors  nothing terribly new  s good basic overview things know re considering carrying 
3,the metal massacre series awesome low points witchslayer lizzy borden bands worth hearing album  
4,these delicious  wrapped well i think  they kind melted wrapping 
5,excellent book  easy directions explanations implement crucial confrontation model 
2,lots diagrams drawings  pointing arrows  etc  i felt though i back class missing required supplementary workbook this book seems address mainly work situations reader boss difficulty recalcitrant employee  there n t much apply life 
5,knowing i crucial confrontation i looked answers help uncomfortable situation   i found   not information valuable business applies family life general  recommend anyone hard time facing confrontations  it written way easy understand apply  the information flows format makes total sense 
5,the follow  crucial conversations  book great tools insight dealing crucial confrontations time time 
3,i found book limited kinds confrontations presented  for narrow focus  information good  although concise i would liked  there many confrontations addressed  how answer employee always wants bigger raise time  how handle employee never satisfied work environment  i would like learned variety crucial confrontations concise format crucial confrontations  tools resolving broken promises  violated expectations  bad behavior
4,this workbook people organizations relationship succesesful confrontation  i think ideas good  it follows basic tenets conflict resolution 
2,unfortunately  i like book  i found difficult read boring  even though recommended friend 
5,this practical best researched book conflict resolution  on top best management leadership books  must read

2,this book started fairly interesting insight impact much money children relationship parents  then  goes reviewer thought might opium trip  i agree  went  boring first couple pages  the predictable  entire book turned major disappointment 
4,i found beginning interesting  albeit kind sad  but turned i guess opiate trip  got downright creepy  gave nightmares i d heard forever i m glad i read  but i would read 
3,over years i ve used lot haynes repair manuals  gotten lot good information  but  volvos  it s almost like got lazy  photocopied pages chiltons  manual  i ve gotten multiplied times useful information internet add fact manual damaged i got  looks like truck run several times   i m really impressed i ll continue use haynes manuals i  bit disappointment

3,ordered usual size  small  tried nextsize still short length  loose heel  slipped back walking same experience friend ordered boots  nice quality price get fit 
3,this book person biting lips found tenuous situation  the writing little bland  repetitive glossed account actual crime approximately three pages long  the totality remaining  book us follow interrogation temporary arrest witnesses reverent  caring  normal rockwellian family grieving processing  nothing perpetrators lives motives recounted anything barest details  mostly could suffice long diary entry family tragedy  really need fashioned book  it hard getting 
3,i applaud author s courage wanting tell story murdered cousins  brother  way horrible tragedy murders impacted family  the story well told  plainly written  author s decision write third person  even writing  clumsy  tends distance reader ways feel counterproductive  a much better read vein strange piece paradise terri jentz blew away author s courage  skill writer 
3,the book alternates chapters home police station  although i ended reading latter story still haunts worth read 
5,i could put book  the story riveting heartbreaking  writing fantastic  reads like novel true crime  i felt like i right horrifying events unfold  family deals tragedy injustices follow  what i admired author  center story  manages generous telling  we go heads viewpoints family member well four killers  result get nuanced  thoughtful balanced portrait fateful night resulting tragedy  the killers living breathing whose lives personalities converge create crime  senseless tragedy robs world two amazing  spirited young women  the author calls book  personal memory stone  cousins  s beautiful  heartbreaking tribute 
4,the heart book chapters   given taut  detailed account brutal attacks hours abuse suffered surviving victim hands st louis homocide detectives chapters  pages  cover investigation  apprehension  trials vermin responsible  unfortunately  author goes tell us parole hearings execution stays ricki lake court tv thus manages actually drain away disturbing power skillfully told 
5,this true account well written  riviting  perfectly clear  what happens young beyond understanding  crime top crime comes mind  but survived tell story 
3,this page turner  i  true crime  reader  perhaps i n t speak book fits genre  seems book something different  although s true  crime   this book s purposes  personal history memorial    therapeutic telling family tragedy   iii  advocacy piece  even i write review  underlying story still making headlines convicted murderers heading death chamber  two days  claims innocence  and  newspaper accounts still carry suggestion victims might explaining  dimension story book sheds lot light  one important comment  i interested book local connection i wanted know story better  i grateful  crime portions  provide minimal detail  the whole thing gruesome enough

3,for need get baloney straight horse s mouth  book freud need decide  visionary fraud  i find incredible thousands  even millions  seemingly intelligent people fallen something little objective evidence favor although freud little   sense humor  unintentionally funny book  for reason   deserves least attempted reading 
1,this new translation   freud s interpretation dreams  i hope someone qualified might soon comment merits significance new translation  meanwhile  editorial review information offered book comes earlier edition different translation freud s work  fwiw  and second paragraph editorial review prelim entirely inappropriate   s another book altogether i give freud s book  translation  low rating misleading  it s interpretation dreams general  specifically s  covertly course  freud s dreams  more basically  s  infantile memories  claimed dreams concealed   for explanation point  could consult  if freud s theory be true    psychological reports      would explain freud tells us book appears

4,for n t n t go traditional class  i think find video dvd helpful  my husband i like watch segment time  if feel miss something n t understand something  simply replay portion  we ordered video i weeks pregnancy  i would recommend others time ask doctors questions n t ask dvd 
4,after reading many reviews criticized sheri bayles  delivery  intended   i prepared informed annoyed  i pleasantly surprised  i thought wry sense humor presentation excellent match material  i watched whole video two days viewing  my husband i dropped local childbirth class found nurse incredibly annoying full scare tactics  exactly tone i wanted  informative  entertaining  fast paced  my issue i would like footage labor  many childbirth class videos seem include  might useful  for simply getting basic information  though  i thought excellent 
5,i thought great  the complaints sound video quality i thought unfounded  i n t find annoying husband i laugh learn  the breathing techniques helpful clearly taught  dvd miss somehow n t getting always rewind  i especially like format compared class i review time i feel need 
4,these classes lot better i expected  most infomration refresher  several things i never knew  the instructer classes hilarious  husband actually sat enjoyed watching  these much easier since n t well class room setting 
4,i thought video certainly worth watching good information  i plan watch i closer delivery notes  this first child overseas  unable childbirthing classes  i find rent netflix i m buying childcare breastfeeding ones  i going rent 
3,so dvd helpful since i never baby new next nothing labor  the problem looks straight s doctor effin annoying  i wanted reach screen strangle whenever told jokes  but yeah  ignore  get helpful info stages labor  go hospital  s real labor etc  
4,okay  the information given thorough helpful  i feel like i learned bit i knew  i m definatly glad i video not attend actual class my husband i watched together  i say i watched  although  i fast forward stupid stories instuctor tells often  i felt bad people video jokes drama  i chose video bacause date older videos market i think information given current enough learn medical technologies today just forwarned sheri bayles annoying  keep remote hand thumb fast forward button  sorry sheri i know tryed keep dry  actually made annoying instead 
5,soon baby shower doctor ordered bed rest  she said i would n t able attend regular lamaze class recommended dvd  happily  sister given us shower gift  it joy watch informative 
3,while i admit dvd set full good information  sheri bayles got annoying woman planet  my husband i often wanted throw something tv   voices  act scenarios incredibly irritating  she makes women labor seem like either cowards idiots  especially ones  god forbid  pain meds  honestly  could learn info reading  what expect  getting different dvd 
5,this great product  we watched couple child birthing videos far informative entertaining  great money saving idea birthing classes costing  days  highly recommended  other videos series great  breastfeeding newborn   good luck 
3,my husband i watched movie thought okay  it informative information otherwise much dvd i n t think worth 
1,this video dull provide information i n t already read books i checked public library free  i m fairly disappointed purchase i feel money could better spent  i find video rather pricey  gave try enthusiastic recommendation friend  needless say  type person must audio visual learn  steer clear find instructional video s concise  if learn reading  i highly suggest check books free save money  if like long winded stories much free time hands  might video 
1,turns sheri annoying person ever  and  really must hate women labor  judging way makes fun mimics whiney  high pitched baby voice  throughout whole  pushing  section talks much whine  n t  wait must really labor yet  she goes horrific pain  tries talk epidural   if l  d nurse  i would cross legs next shift change 
4,overall  dvd great  it s informative hey  watch time  according schedule the instructor funnier beginning i found  gets little long winded  trying hard funny childbirth  but  s fast forward  button  right  compared others market  n t many choose   i think s keeper 
4,i say information good comedy i could without   i think thats made long i liked meat film  i liked something husband i without going class didnt bunch breathing exsercises i would n t use  the breathing  fucusing object breath past contractions worked like charm  i given family member husband 
5,i glad i sign in person classes  this video fulfills need  i feel well informed

4,jean m auel captures efficiently changing times landscape neanderthals passing evolution towards modernly advanced cro magnons  the story provides excellent descriptions nature climate time  captures customs people  the highlight novel revolves around medicinal plants herbs constantly brought iza ayla s work medicine women  the low points novel repetitive elements auel s description landscape certain details repeated verbatim  however  story clings flip pages hurriedly  trying find next stages ayla s life  overall  good worthwhile read 
2,i would n t stuck improbably  even fantasy  much beyond parts ayla   invents shampoo   discovers fire  i proverbial  desert island  situation  happens    i guess sci set stone age 
2,the premise story interesting story good  s bad s poorly executed  the prose blocky reads like pre history textbook characters plot slapped afterthought  in general much time spent detail  like author needed make several length reducing rewrites  for example spends quite bit time describing women clan treated property  cliched n t need passing mention  she spends lot time talking side characters under developed characters tell apart  the detail pre historical fauna lifestyle told long paragraphs bring story screeching halt  rather woven narrative way s still entertaining  however lot skimming book keep reading

5,she older book paper back  ex tore spite  i got hard back  nearly broke back excitment    she nearly tears happy 
3,book wordy takes long time finish  started last week iam currently middle book  places get lost
1,one worst novels i ever read  well researched  maybe  poorly written  definately  the plot simply goes nowhere  characters unrealistic banal impossible feel sympathetic toward  why author felt abandon attempt subtlety  write readers ignorant characters seem beyond 
5,i really liked book  i always interested early  i think book sheds new light way could back  i found book facinating  i think wonderful experence although n t facts still good job filling empty spaces 
5,i rated good book grabbed attention inmediatly  not intersting instructive  i recommends everybody  regards 
1,do n t bother wasting money  this book slow goes nowhere fast  i could even finish book 
4,this book different  who would thought could write work fiction cave man days  it kept attention i n t wait start second book series 
4,interesting informative story cave people survived  the writing somewhat elementary repetitive good plot  i would read second book series 
5,this unlike usual choice reading  i really enjoyed  it contained lot interesting events information really stimulated anger  cruel treatment broud ayla   i disliked broud would done everything power annoy i ayla  disappointed ayla left behind clan  would slowed  i reccomend book avid reader handle long yet interesting books  also  i district official school  i would make mandatory prehistoric history students 
5,i loved book much  ayla sure classic liturature next decade  she great role modle  i think woman major courage  if first book series  keep reading s worth time effort  i promise 
5,i got book christmas  hesitant read  sounded little boring  but i brought read  loved  i loved every word  it pgs  i read  days  it excellent  jean auel expressed ayla s feeling  broud s hatred  iza s love  creb s frustration  it wonderful story 
4,do remember clan cave bear hype mid s    it rage  the book good  good story  little difficult believe times  since lot actions people  clans  hypothesized  but determinate story survival  coming age post ice valleys  i believe  auel stole bit native americans  well steal  since culture closely mirrors nomadic clans  interesting depictions seers  spirit chasers medicine women  there romantic scenes i admit little much year old  interesting nonetheless  slightly educational good read   jennifer rees
5,the best book right  ms auel s story makes feel though right next ayla whole time  you re s earthquake  time clan  leaves way  when i read first story  i could n t put i finished  i ran bookstore buy others  i n t wait fifth  and long books series coming  i ll reading  two thumbs must read

4,there something mundane exciting book  i read cover cover  i could n t put  it s beautiful story author put much research  a must read women interested prehistoric culture even n t mind books good believeable heroine i first started book i could n t get first apparent mundanity story  but i discovered later beauty details book  the characters author s descriptions landscape culture people wonderful i highly recommend addition fantasy collection 
5,while people complain inaccuracies ms auel s novel  important remember written s  back much archaeological technologies existed  much know today know back  especially field genes  however  researched back  re presented solid enjoyable read  the descriptions lush  sometimes overwhelming  definitely get good read  i find better many novels today sub par authors like danielle steel fern michaels 
5,i read book aroundn years ago  read several times since  the amount research ms auel puts books make story really shine  i problem envisioning settings surroundings clan territory  sometimes ms auel could get heavy descriptions  better authors rush vital element story  ayla s struggle fit clan learn ways always easy  especially constant antagonism broud  hates ayla apparent reason  in immensely patriarchal society clan  okay beat woman  ayla hard time  good moments  finds place value within clan  this book i never forget  shame enthralling saga came pathetic land painted caves   sixth final book series 
1,i m sorry spoilsport  i found terrible book worse series  leaving aside wild inaccuracies  main ones auel s portrayal neandertals doltish brutes the heroine constantly making earthshaking discovery another  shampoo  domestication animals  law genetics  sex pregnancy   last least  tampax  no else figure anything   churning nobel laureate discovery another  i m sure later books found making short wave radio large rock  it became really maddening 
2,the kindle editions books chock full typographical errors sometimes make difficult figure written  the typos made feel like i d gyped price books 
2,extremely well written  good plot  characters mrs auel done research  now s bad part  it anthropologically inaccurate  mrs auel beautifully stereotyped depiction neanderthals stooped  muzzle jawed  intellectually inferior creatures compared wonderful cro magnon people tall erect graceful carriage  blue eyes blond hair  i mentioned book anthropology professor said  succintly   burn   quot

2,the way score game dekes  rebounds defelections  the gameplay stinks  commontary stinks  do not   waist money game 
1,wow  fire emblem horribly designed game   listening characters talk  and talk i mean see pictures screen nothing mouths moving eyes blinking written say  it gets boring quickly  on top fighting almost like playing chess  move characters around squares board never get actually attack enemies  all initiate attack command show little video targeted character hitting enemy maybe hitting back  it s monotonous  cheap looking  fun  my advice anyone considering buying game rent first  then see bad wasting money  opinion  worst gamecube game ever 
5,path radiance incredible game i ve spent waaayyyy much time  simply many characters choose  thus many different tactics use  it s excellent turn based strategy game requires much planning attention enemy movement capabilities similar games  e g  ff tactics   the real gripe i game fact revive characters  may find position nearly complete stage enemy gets lucky critical hit guys destroys  leading beating controller head  swearing liberally reach reset button prepare another hour exact stage  thus  i gave    fun  stars  characters definitely not fun  otherwise  i love game  highly reccommend 
4,not game challenge brain gameplay  story well  inbetween strategizing  awesome story class race  political social strife  rife emotion  while story complex convoluted  never loses logical train thought i gripe  presentation lacking  though character designs top notch  hawk king awesome   music bland  gameplay character interaction animation barely scratches possible gamecube  i lived cutscenes  drop dead gorgeous  far between overall  good game  a must starving gamecube owners  so buy game maybe next home console iteration  revolution  please   game bigger budget could improve presentation 
5,this got best games gamecube  the combat simple easy learn  yet later soon get  complicated fun time  about   story done cinematic cutscenes voice acting good  the graphics beautiful colerful look great  everything sounds good  the story showstopping full surprises terms epic compared lord rings  overall 
5,i n t know  stars overal rating  path radiance fantastic     the charecters names atleast sane unlike many charecters fire emblems   the charecters different eachother interesting    the storyline much others well  i never get board try hard get fighting sequences like i sacred stones if interest games  get definately among top   
4,this great game  good mix turn based strategy action  you play moving team around grid  choosing see results   turn based strategy  from  give front action players combat  etc  it s good fun game  the side i see sometimes really wan dive game make run long history lore game give background  so far  i ve unable find way skip aside pressing buttons goes away lets play  that i m giving   stars  aside  great game  i m playing wii gamecube controller memory card   required play wii 
5,this may favorite games ever  here pros cons pros  it good plot   there strong main character n t worry dying   you need use least strategy win   pick fight battle possible characters   good art cut scenes   a lot hours gameplay   good replay value  if re bored make new game try using different people strategies cons  can confusing first   a little much talking battles  sometimes  i would hurry  i would skip plot order save game can go either way  when character battle n t get back  instead restart level  however adds strategy battles i beleive game worth buying

3,i intrigued movie  john carter  decided read books  since free kindle  i found first    imaginative adventurous kind lost edge  also got tired little  time  mostly action    action bad  nice get background culture description well  but sci fi must read 
5,more similar simplicity princess mars gods warlord  john carter s engages search abducted thuvia  remains prime suspect abduction  usual strange meetings stranger neighborhoods  story little less frenentic gods warlord  carthoris thuvia solid characters 
4,thuvia  maid mars classic pulp science fiction our hero framed abduction princess thuvia  goes rescue clear name it s pretty classic romance plot  hero heroine love  unsure feels  societal political conventions standing way  shhhh   n t tell 
3,i enjoyed story much barsoom books edgar rice burroughs  however i would n t recommend illustrated version  the typeface spacing novel kindle edition made book difficult read  i constantly tapping button go next page since words page  almost like children s book  if i would purchased different version i would give book least  stars 
3,readers remember age context book entire erb series  all i found reading series enjoyable  the would extensively up dated someone try push today 
3,i found thuvia  maid mars enjoyable story  it follows next generation characters  fallible overall less fun john carter 
1,i read first  john carter books wanted see story progressed  edgar rice b made bored style  this story long description short plot  there much description i lost track i reading  i realize wrote last century people realize mars  i guess i embarrassed mars rover proves edgar rice right      
4,awesome book  i ve read books series  you disappointed  edgar rice burroughs time author i look forward reading form 
2,this album offers nothing new exciting genre metal  this reminiscent mediocre late s trash metal  songs sounding  mid paced tempos simplistic solos abound  moronic wayyyyy out of date pretend satanic lyrics cartoony cover art  just dumb  dumb  dumb  want real thrash metal  aside big four  try coroner  arch enemy  arsis  the crown  haunted  hypocrisy  others poop album miles 
4,one help find entranced soundscapes chicago group creates  songs   afternoon speaker   cruising vocals sam prekop bring back i may call   simpler time   kind nostalgia mode  strange vast songs  seem span horizon  yet remind good feels use headphones keep things self  like chapter good book  album keep rolling upon sand dunes  finally ending sand caked feet good tan  afternoon still continuing  an excellent album   as side note  design album s case fantastic  
3,i pumped album released  unfortunately  i bit disappointed  the music album characteristically sea cake  mellow relaxing  what lacks  however  compared  the biz     the fawn     nassau   upbeat songs  when i listen album  songs seem blend together  the magic behind albums taking rocking stuff keeping somehow unintrusive  i would highly suggest buying  nassau    the biz   ve never heard  the sea cake   i ll still listen album  course 
4,some people find bad taste music rest sea cake whose originality creativity rarity days  no cool videos haircuts even cool belt  damn fine music  listen  photos  man   some people find boring feel bad simple minds wrap around cakes sweet melodies  colony fabulous among others 
4,onth album  seemed like fun side project surely coming  refined  intimately arranged group offered arguably sleekest sophistication date 
5,something cult band insofar albums  although critically applauded  usually stumbled across word mouth  the unashamedly easy listening  tag associated music  probably deters people  but actually listen tracks  s preciousness accessibly music  although features lyrics hushed sighs  several instrumental tracks feature throughout  you d cynical listener smile hearing catchy guitar pop  afternoon speaker   indeed acoustic lounge  the leaf     not album impress friends  but music evokes positive expression  sunny afternoon every turn  restrained  bittersweet indie pop rarely well composed 
3,sucked unassuming gem record called the fawn  i continue listen new sea cake music though  honestly  thrill paled  perhaps band    oui fine record  sam prekop  leader sea cake  seems working desire arto lindsay fronting stereolab  could n t tell s singing  vocals n t inaudible  though whispered  barely projected  he seems disinterested s singing  i  as long keep tempos jaunty  oui moves along nice clip  when slow things  re deadly

3,if like fun genre known  stoner rock    ll like sixty watt  they revel sabbath riffs  mixed liberal doses southern rock  in case  s bad   fear death by water  cool slide licks singer dan kerzwick s rasp sounds like drankth whiskey   low earth orbit  laid back groove existential lyrics   roll the stone  pure skynyrd way  as lot bands play kind music  repetoire limited awhile songs tend repeat  this record good beginning though

5,since issue people getting wrong card  i wanted say amazon send correct card i nikon coolpixm camera  the card seems work fast  i tried days 
2,this lunch box actually small flimsy used  my grandson puts disney miniature cars  instead  once filled  latch would barely stay closed order hold contents  basically  s cheap piece metal disney cars painted justify price 
1,i believe  discounted  price   buy identical item suppliers amazon    s right   less   search  key float   
3,this wonderful awful  always gadzooksie  a pures musical plus yma sumac  hired periodically yelp screechy song ok  i luvit 
3,i n t really say anything really  after reading yma sumac s incredible range  little disappointing find remarkable weird version humming  her songs n t actually lyrics  there nice numbers  nothing really stands mind  here s your illusions probably best number s pleasant  i d say main reason buy collectors value  barbara cook  it probably n t around much future 
1,what little plot old  aliens send rep look us  only interested sex lives  plenty good looking babes  no acting tallent  the music bites 
2,a dvd clear good photography quite pleasant watch little embarrasing family company  really suitable watching private 
1,for kind movie supposed get bord skip  but s happened only person could act  most women maxs  the best part movie front cover 
3,there enough plot acting good enough movie watchable  even soft porn looking 
5,overall movie might considered plot i say blonde movie simply awesome  the ending blow mind wow anything get movie watch ending    
3,this n t i thought soft core i guess i watched  times i guess i got i paid for lol
4,i mood alien invasion movies day watched small marathon  as well movies the arrival  i watched film called femalien  femalien reminds modern remake the girl from starship venus femalien story alien landing earth study human interactions  the energy given form young woman  what follows scenes spying couples interactions others  the alien collecting cataloging experiences race risen physicality still miss  during adventures tries help local woman retain ownership diner while plot weak i recommend film times movie like invasion star creatures galaxina sort thing looking 
2,the r rated dvd movie worth price  it s cut smithereens  buy unrated version  instead 
3,i got sexual seens i ve heard  fine women  something could n t watch twice  it gets boring  oh   get unrated version  i n t see guys stay limp working girls 
3,cinemaxs movie  given dont look anything deep good acting 
1,big disappointment  during simulated unsexy sex scenes sound track changes awful detached music kills mood  the main charactor n t even good looking  you  hot stuff   then check  unedited unrated versions  emmanuelle  emmanuelle   dessert hearts  hottest lesbian scene ever made   butterflies are free  tender cousins  french language version   carried away  lured innocence  that s  a  list erotica  warning n t view time  ll melt vcr 
3,plenty skin  lots silicone  paper thin dialogue  overbearing  godawful soundtrack  they could done lot better either decent music none  n t let give  half stars  i would give many  best  save money decent porno flick  this n t quite cut 
3,understandable  though could great spoof  like  cannibal women   could great erotic adventure   could mighty declaration power eros sorry   none guys film get  good  the gals ok  problem stop  there problem 
2,because video unrated carries warning information area i feel shoppers aware rights soft core porn film strong sexual content little science fiction  i bought vhs version another source expecting sort movie  roger corman presents  might sponsor  something along lines  species  amanda  alien  while vein latter sci fi part   technology matter   limited teleportations via telekinesis aura emotion melding  the movie probably  time made sexual contact  technically movie suprisingly well made genera  it shot film  video tape   the scenery professionally done acting level reaches daytime soap operas  the sound quality bad  so technical qualities transfered dvd  beware content 
3,femalien pretty decent plot  great looking women pretty good softcore action  it s mainly female alien  tara   venesa taylor  comes earth study human sexuality  she observes participates genders human species action orgies  the lead actress taylor  tara  attractive buxom  girl next door  sort way comes sweet good natured  in fact  women way movie notable aspect female characters  a pretty decent soft adult film fare slight plot hovering writhing flesh  
4,as nerd  i d always dreamed race nymphomaniacal superwomen would descend upon space probe  until night happened  it turns excessive probing quite painful  mention humiliating  femalien offers nerds scared undergo sexy alien abduction legitimate erotic alternative  three billion thumbs 
1,i movie  i saw collectors addition  flyboys game  i thought i would buy market place  good seller  dvd game advertised  it came demo version game  they said box  thanks bunch false advertisement  thought extras might make  wrong  do n t waste time money 
1,i m aviation buff i ll accept mediocre screenplay poor character development flying worthwhile  sorry say film falls short fronts  intended   the cgi flying scenes contrived  sadly inaccurate  the fokker triplane introduced not plot suggests  nieuport gnome rotary engine revolved around s crankshaft  closeups  cylinders stationary now plot  cliches movie  i appreciate campy lines  we n t send green kids flimsy crates   re delivered errol flynn basil rathbone  the dawn patrol  dialogue flat acting passable best i hoping film would better reviews suggested  n t  do n t waste time 
4,if ever movie designed james dean style actor   although  inspired  true story  nothing original movie s story line s outcome rather predictable  know wwi ended   even two criticisms nothing away action portrayed movie  i missed seeing cinemas watched dvd  i really wish i made effort viewed big screen  the scene french bi planes attacking zeppelin awesome  fight scenes plenty  there real disappointments movie  failing see big screen   great watch  walk away thinking   pretty good  i d watch     
3,this may film made past twenty years deals world war i aerial combat  it s easy thing since planes gone  enter cgi devoted souls tracking remaining combat planes  the graphics sometimes leave something desired  overall effect majestic exciting the storyline nonexistent james franco seems destined also ran  shame since s fine actor  he n t get shine often projects get film visuals  n t get excited plot  
1,i enjoy historical movies re done right  this clich ridden story pain watch i fell asleep several times second half  the movie ridiculously predictable  although scenes writers still managed surprise  private airlift flown main character order rescue french girlfriend kids advancing german troops  taking villainous german ace pilot final dogfight revolver  machine gun jammed broke  examples worst writing taste  to say something positive  acting n t bad opinion  i ve seen much worse lately   could n t save flawed project  i would n t object lack historical accuracy story enjoyable   i m giving star order offset multitude   stars ratings  otherwise i d give two stars  do favor  ignore movie watch blue max instead 
1,when i heard larry ellison world s second richest involved  i go see movie  expecting great things  oracle sized greatness  instead n t fooled   star ratings people give movie  what load rubbish  i expected action movie  great fights  true  not romance set serious  the lead actor terrible  sorry cast young actor  it n t interesting  the interesting actor guy lion  the rest i n t even remember  all i remember movie zepplin exploding funeral mention guy lion atheist n t much religion anyway  so  true waste money  and second rate actors kiddie script writers getting rich hype 
4,the critics n t like part  i really good time  flyboys n t win awards  sure entertained packed theater  people laughed little jokes scattered throughout long film  clocking two hours bit long dialogue lacking  romance handled well  unlike pearl harbor  thank god    many amazing cgi dogfight scenes  if bored afternoon  check flyboys  otherwise wait dvd 
2,the computer generated flying scenes unreal us real pilots n t watch thing   you fly next yell back forth aircraft   they hand signals   story line far historical   i guess ok highschool date movie  
4,it s oscar time film  diverting  i thought give good overview escadrille motivations characters came us volunteer  true  terrors n t driven home saving private ryan  n t kind movie  fortunately   year old s interest wwi planes motivated purchase  he able watch without many disturbing scenes  although scene trenches pretty intense   if re looking intense  gripping action emotional turmoil  along titanic level accuracy  n t  but family movie i thought pretty good 
1,this absolutely idiotic excuse movie actually got enjoyable  simply viewing companions i began game  guess which cliche is going to be used next   by time the black baron  whatever    got shot   raiders lost ark   group overcome hysterical  albeit quite rude  comments laughter have n t much fun since stupid movie f1 pilot shot bosnia to think bravery  envelope pushing  absolute horror devolved depiction this jeez oh man  what r gon battle britain       
2,fair representation could great  fight  movie the movie edited less  hours withoutalot frivolities occur ground  you could still buildenough characters make interesting without prolonged love story  the action air decent 
3,this movie n t work  some battles good  the battle zeppelin especially exciting  however  love story slowed story  since n t speak language  almost painful hear communicate  he france months  surounded french speakers n t pick phrases french  he joined french military unit  would n t rather motivated learn language  the air battles work  almost go video game mode times  the characters tad boring  depth 
3,from two hour twenty mintue movie forty mintues edited  i wanted see film i wanted see bunch dogfights planes shot  and deliver   very well   but director spent way much time focusing drama time cassidy s romance french girl  the special effects action make movie worth watching  but bordome must endured dogfights prevents movie reaching full action movie potential ups  cool cinematography  fun action scenes good special effectsdowns  plenty action movie clichés long  boring sequences
5,the disc send fast time  made perfect shape info great amazon  thanks great job well done 
1,i asked clerk video store determine number videos buy rentals  she told based box office record film  she  flyboys  one would plenty the story sappy  the acting  the aerial sequences much like video game  try  flight simulator   wwi biplanes hanging props    climbing degrees   landing biplane shell cratered   s land  heat battle save buddy hand  arm  legs  torso  hand  trapped wing crashed plane   that s realism   there n t much believable film  a third way movie i fast forwarded scenes except dogfights  i hoping something order  the blue max     flyboys  stalled climb  went flat spin  augured deep depths movie flops 
1,here another example hollywood going wrong  the history implicated events portrayed movie tough get right  nevertheless  film makers got details correct  added improbable special effects  far many triplanes  annoying social lesson stereotypes  host ridiculous story twists time wasting baggage  conceptually  movie winner  in execution  disappointment  they ruined potentially good story  instead buying movie  i would suggest blue max aerial scenes far better  propose would be viewer read history book as parting comment  however  i always liked jean reno  he good part film 
3,i somewhat disapppointed flyboys  the movements wwi planeswere unrealistic  the motion vintage planes dogfights farmore capabilities would allow  we sent wwii hero innew zealand  friend   rated average 
3,the story good  riveting  sort canned story line  action good flying scenes pretty believable  i much interest connected love story  i realize pilots private life interest  i airplane nut i wanted see  to see planes accuracy flying scenes overall film good  certainly great 
3,i watch video american history project school  i admit took two nights first night hold interest well enough  when i finally finished  i admit surprised  i much enjoy movie  it s nice top of the line actors performances  it nice done fashion would allow events actually taken place happened  it rush like would  oh say  james bond movies  allowed natural time scope  some comments call slow  yes  slow  s natural slowness nice see movie  it tempting add collection dvd s   i reccomend parent student studying  helping study  wwi 
4,unlike technical experts hate score  criticize presence red fokker triplanes  condemn physics aerial battles  mention  quality acting  i enjoyed every minute film  but  i like airplanes  i like good guys good guys  the story line interesting throughout  the acting fine  thank  special effects great  i recommend film except nitpickers mentioned 
4,i expecting flyboys tank  and didnt  the movie could help box office different  flyboys sounds dumb  advertising leading release  when viewing movie cant find fault acting  everyone good job  the plot writing arent perfect get point across  the bond battle together works well  the romance though key  we two people speak different languages fall love  its heart movie opinion  the action great  though i could argue dogfighting short  you get blood pumping particular fight ends soon  the battles could longer well executed  very good movie   
4,this really fun movie watch took awefull lot creative liscense  the combat scenes fun looked fake  if dive steeply film long nieuport would rip lower wing clean  probably fokkers  if realistic combat scenes i would recomend the blue max movie still keep edge seat  one think i n t like fact made germans look really bad  i ve read many accounts german pilots really went way humane many stories allied pilots downright cruel  mannock   wwi niether side better  n t happened  entangling alliances itch 
1,aircraft physics  cgi  horrible  planes n t fly way  and german guy course dressed black s really bad  the hero becomes obsessed getting even  course  most video games superior sillyness  total waste   
2,nice actions  looking authentic wwi aerial combat drama try  der rote baron  instead 
3,flyboys starring james franco kept attention  great special effects moving story beginning  martin henderson stars  this film set turblent time world war i  parts film bit dragged i wish movie cut two hours flyboys impress frame frame  enjoy 
4,there long tradition movies  howard hughes even made one this movies good aerial shots the acting pretty good  i think may remake ofan older film  full color the glamor air red baron there real americans actually fought here ww i first real dehumanizing warswith trench lines poison gas  the fighter pilotsgave new  knight  like quality air 
4,fantastic special effects  makes think re actually air  period uniforms  period aircraft  good scenery  the love story part bit hokey  i liked movie 
4,i know movie lot historical inaccuracies lot cliches funth grade students  i use teach hollywood glorifies history rewrites sake entertainment  andth grade students understand cliches  after  i would able show all quiet western front joyeux noel  they would fall asleep  i n t even censor part movie  the movie good 
4,the movie reviewers commented provides viewer realistic near historically correct account early fighter plane pilot experiences ww1  the dogfight bombing scenes spectacular convey perils early fighter plane flying  the touch romanticism subtle makes picture appealing wider audience might put thinking movie  i thoroughly enjoyed watching movie would actualy give   stars 
3,as wwi aviation historian i delighted seest century movie aviation  the acting dialog laughable point i turned sound  although accuracy ww1 types aircraft spectacular amount far course reality  this film would excellent using back round flavor veteran pilot reunion 
1,having excited prospect gripping  historically accurate  realistic wwi film  lafayette escadrille   flyboys big letdown  devoid historical substance  second rate acting  predictable storyline  n t big surprise movie flop theaters briefly  cgi dogfights border ridiculous  aircraft hardly capable acrobatics stunts shown throughout film  more reminiscent star wars actual flying also  portrayal germans laughable   all german pilots flying bright red  red baron style  fokker dr i triplanes  led sinister  black falcon      come  recommended   the blue max  
1,the plot movie ruins thing try computer animation  even n t good i expected 
3,this seems love hate pictures  i start good  the historical accuracy good  the air battles excellent  it nice finally movie covering wwi little  the bad bland lead actor  terrible cliches  white guy n t like black guy life saving event  changes heart  the lead learns work others  etc   seen million pictures  so overall  well shot movie story worth seeing  lack strong acting compelling script bring 
5,excellent documentary drama  if enjoy history love  would liked happy ever ending though 
3,its good movie watch mood movie kinda tells story
5,while story drifts times  still entertaining movie great dogfight scenes  makes wonder early fighter pilots went 
4,i watched movie  times  i thoroughly enjoyed movie  the complaint i fact german planes almost red  which totally inaccurate  the plane red reality  red baron  who even movie  otherwise americans would dead  roflol   seriously though  fighting sequences great watch  especially see bullets flying air  if would movies like  technology  would great  maybe less romance  flying action  flying sequences short opinion  worth buying enjoyable  
4,this really must see blue ray disc  i read lot reviews getting must say i see excitement  watching movie blue ray treat  the movie okay specail effects photography really made exciting expierence 
1,for fan old wood fabric fighters wwi  film causes nothing heartburn  the cgi effects painfully bad  obviously fake hurts watch  and scenes use actual airplanes  recreations  bad  what really bugged fighters fixed radial engines  rather rotaries  forget film  read  winged victory  story somebody lived  if see real airplanes fly  go rhinebeck  ny 
1,considering richness subject matter real life stories lived truly bad movie  the makers tried tell everything result told nothing  the characters unbelieveably superficial many flying scenes historically inaccurate unreal  if special effects good many necessarly better  the blue max battle britain far far superior  for willing put mess look recreations old airplanes probably worth buying prepared alot dissapointment looking good movie 
4,i enjoyed dvd suplemental dvd well  i give film four stars great computer graphics clean plot  the reality factor taken little far concerning aircraft abilities capabilities time  still   film enjoyable  i n t help wish developed characters  i guess time restraints consider  anyway  fun movie relax eat pop corn family  sure beats watching yet another hum flesh eatting zombie spin seems always showing  smile  
3,entertaining enough film cgi flying scenes never lose computer game look  ww1 planes flew maximum speed mph yet film flit like something star wars  if reality check movie makers could deliver ww1 aviation movie  years ago  compare film  the blue max    aces high   
5,i went see theater tempered expectations based  average  reviews movie received critics  i pleasantly surprised  this great movie subject period largely ignored hollywood 
4,i loved movie  everyting great direction  stunning visuals  good looking cast  great locations  superb arieal fight scenes  awesome blu ray picture  sound quality other great action  covers romance  friendships  more pssst thats watch  find  
1,i usually review films  case i feel neccessary  i world war i aviation buff many years  when i first heard someone making film subject i knew i see  my disappointment i finally saw film hardly imagined  it s drag every movie cliche thats ever used type story  literally single authentic detail presentation detail film  the airplanes wrong  airplane paint jobs  markings  armaments wrong  the clothes uniforms wrong  even airfield guys flying wrong  it appears film makers  instead researching information life volunteer french air service period  opted looking old hollywood movies subject  watch film whatever entertainment value may  get idea world war i aerial combat like 
2,this films emphasis placed aerial dogfight sequences  little thought went plot acting what lame excuse movie  my biggest complaint movie s cliche could cut knife  the role texan blaine rawlings  flits moments notice new love  beyond belief plausability  the rest acting ensemble  capt  thenault  jean reno   window dressing piece movie dribble  and dreaded german ace hardly voyeur wanted savor victory sight victim s died lame plot  poor acting  dubious historical accuracy  wrapped around nice dogfight sequences  what shame  i hoped better this do n t buy turkey  save money get  dogfight    accurate  exciting  historically true 
3,i m sorry say i n t share enthusiasm previous reviewers film  do n t get wrong  n t bad film  n t great either  i agree fight scenes well done exciting watch   i disappointed  i found acting mediocre tone film somewhat cheesy  i thought  i expecting serious film category saving private ryan   i witnessed similar jerry bruckheimer s pearl harbor   it  feel good  movie  realistic  do n t get wrong  film s moments  n t i expected  so entertained couple hours  i could think plenty worse movies  re expecting epic film  flyboys  
4,this excellent movie little known piece history  wherein group american volunteers traveled france learn fly assist french effort german aircraft  there several encounters german ace  red baron  shot something like allied planes the movie well done air action exciting 
1,i n t  surprising i love  discover  new acts  you know i n t buy  i n t think even allowed sell garbage   when i get alone  i m gon clothes  n t nobody gon interupt game   i could n t believe song like could make onto airwaves  i know ll make fun  genie in a bottle   i n t  s innocent cute girl  when guy sings stuff like  i throw rock em 
3,i bought souldecision s cd i absolutely loved single  faded   the beat song makes dance i n t equate boy bands  songs  frankly  rest cd disappointed bit  i n t expect much i bought  i impressed fact guys play instruments  i must admit album far blew feet  i hope souldecision produces singles quality  faded   lead singer trevor hottttie  i saw concert seattle  nice 
3,from canadian music channel much music i saw videos faded ooh it s kinda crazy  thought group cool sound  although songs along lines   ex   gravity  definitely much boy band feel tastes  i think reason s debut cd see people like  put lot different songs wait people s reaction  by next cd definite sound  so chances re gon like every song cd

5,book recieved fast great shape  i needed fast i could send china serving mission came time send christmas package  thank service
2,while book good providing scripture quotations  commentary dated extremely biased  if book shared people non mormon faiths  would become defensive rightly  the author s invective toward catholic faith appaling  many mission presidents recommend book  it could dangerous hands untrained

4,the first story novella  basically holly golightly type named melba toast uses money  female friend admirer sure wants become like melba  this story rest short ones quite different ones jaffe s usual innocent  naive heroine limited insight behavior  the tone real  women realistic  stories well written overall  i would recommend book jaffe book 
3,this decent movie  advertised horror movie  this would fall catagory  mad scientist  movie  this movie could set anywhere world this movie advertised vacationers would run monster foriegn country  from viewpoint  i disapointed  but sheer intertainment  pretty good  except fact  i keep repeating  action appear without form lighting  if see going  takes away movie  to honest  josh duhmal  would great  movie week   his  rising star  status lifted movie major motion picture status had i known n t horror movie  i would bought  great rent  great buy

1,i thought pretty bad  hostel better crap  i mean ok parts i n t expect much  it s even scary  i n t wait watch hostel  comes 
3,im glad average rating movie  stars  think deserves  i bought high hopes  let  do n t get wrong  n t bad  major problem  it would  star  n t lighting  the last  minutes  completely black  almost  all  add extra light  but besides  really good film i wish would corrected lighting  could  star  i seen no budget movies better lighting  acting great  lots blood   gore  and characters likable 
2,this may films fault  i like  not sort thing  i probably never bought first place 
3,this movie portrays country savage  neanderthalesque  lawless  lewd corrupt destination it missed pigmees  canibals drums   the good thing movie bikini clad girls  hot it pity brazilian doctor spanish surname rather odd urge kill them i n t know case tourist organs removed the local thieves  kidnappers rapists n t thing here  ll gon robbed re camera  watch jewelry your kidneys quite safe 
4,surely  hostel pushes gore new level  but honest i think turistas slightly realistic hostel  a groups something picked slaughtered internal organs vacationing brazil  wonder whether movie banned brazil bad publicity tourism  lead charactered brother sister  rarity flicks like usually lovers  check jeepers creepers main heroes brother sister  overall  movie well paced  well balanced action  gore  humour yes  sex  the dvd slighty disappointing  the  sound ok picture transfer dark hard see s going screen night scenes  there good commentary director john stockwell if like hostel  brainer even n t like hostel  may still like better hostel 
4,i liked movie better hostel  this movie great scenery amazonian jungle plus a plus underwater chase scenes  there s gory kinda disturbing death scene  even though main characters dimensional  could relate identify character cared person  in hostel  i n t feel asleep theatres saw hostel  i really n t believe characters hostel  what chances seeing hispanic guy whose best friends two white americans go trip europe  give break  because hispanic people n t white americans best friends  come  there s still lot racism polite society  people racist behind closed doors  i find turistas much believable hostel 
2,just another movies  a bunch young kids travelling somewhere get cut pieces psycho wants organs  neither scary educational  tommy  taking anatomy  believe  movie n t help pass class    many scenes dark tell happened  hear someone scream light streakes across screen  next thing know  someone dropped  it okay see free  worth pay ticket 
2,this movie basically storyline hostel  except gore  possibly tribute lines cannibal holocaust  i m gore fan  i enjoyed hostel  this movie complete ripoff  suspense scares  this anotyher generic exploitation flick  the characters  dimensional  exisiting slaughtered  let occasional yell  story trite  villain believable  i m sorry i wasted time 
1,movie plain bad  bad story  bad  gore   bad everything  n t waste money time watching

3,ray j s album certainly expected i guess s record sales n t high expected  the tracks lack originality creativity usually solution problem new producer and or songwriter  definitely needed  rodney  darkchild  jerkins sounds become bit redundant slightly unimpressive  however  ballads unforgettable ray j really shines tracks  one wish    melody    anytime    centerview  i think hooked new producer career would soar  somebody like babyface songwriter like diane warren  brandy s  have you ever    specializes ballads s ray j s best  on plus side though  album thankfully n t silly skits track track  s okay album  i recommend buy goes 
3,i have ray j s first cd i enjoyed the ballads his ballads on the new cd are different does take getting used to but i did enjoy them i have already added some songs to my ipod he can go a long way he needs to be with a good producer maybe babyface someone that will make work harder make him use his voice more but oer all cd is not all bad

2,boring  book short story  shocked people liked much 
1,mr timothy  a novel disappointing lack cleverness i always look tidbits humor found nothing much  angry  immage tim adult 
1,slow  dark  brooding nicest things i could say  this books i truly wished i could return get money back  i love historical mysteries  i n t happened characters uninteresting 
3,this book well written   sometimes  i often found wandering reading  something i often  i love books set time period i sad i like book  the book started clearly i knew happening got muddled i would get lost found chapter lost  as i right   i entirely sure going book  for readers stay focused not buy book  advanced readers  i would check library  this i would spend money 
3,i read novel year ago  i confess i picked curious author planned loved literary characters english literature  to honest i never expected i got  for reason  popular perception main character nature plot  i thought forewarning might beneficial potential readers the author present story well like caleb carr the alienist and consider spoiler it deals harsh unsavory realities underworld victorian age child prostitution  time age consent young virginity commodity bought sold  ugliness may imply modern reader  banyon dicken s approach  some images may graphic sensitive reader uninitiated kind victorian world writers like carr  i think masterful writer 
3,one might wished author used christmas carol background stepping off point mystery thriller occasionally dickensian subject matter scarcely dickensian flavor panache  somehow i felt i d tricked  tim uncle scrooge somehow taken advantage well intentioned author simply lacked  well  inspiration inspiration  and mysteries must  toward conclusions  laboriously explain high list pleasures i n t bad time stretch imagination  i   disappointed 
2,the concept good  certainly worked bayard s poe novel   but half dozen chapters  i still could n t less tim  the prose tended towards pedantic supporting characters flat 
3,this third fairbanks movie i ve seen quite frankly really good  it pales compared robin hood especially thief bagdad  the movie fragmented needs way many textboards keep viewers story fairbanks fun watch s screen dominates  however  presence  acting  fairbanks  therefore movie  way dependent farcical comedy  at times movie even edges dangerously close vaudeville act  also swashbuckling  movie amounts much wildly wacking away sword  maybe i saw soon hugely superior thief bagdad   
5,this album great s crime people know  sometimes gorgeous sometimes really crunching cathartic stuff  combined kind odd murky haunting sonic atmosphere expectmp  this album clearly slapped together job  comprising new material plus b sides outtakes etc period years  and yet material outdistances anything else ve done  the bass work particular phenomenal  plays like lead guitar  also  re fan pinback really  one caveat  i almost never listen cd   except song  the trail   great  first song cd really worst album  so n t let put  rest first cd   wow  wow  if desert island disc limited choice  might   well  okay  beatles disc might win instead    really  s good 
2,the poster i received okay  s  planet earth  written italics along bottom  instead earth  i really would preferred i chose spend money  especially since buy i mistakenly got instead ish  however  shipping fast poster spotless 
2,they sent similar incorrect poster  half cool  it missing nasa sign upper left corner well earth solar system lettering  instead words planet earth written italics number fake stars added background  the picture earth  rest poster n t compare shown 
5,i love cd  i listen whenever i m  it helps thing 
5,it was excellent  very hot  hot  hot  it brought back many memories of the concert i saw in november  
2,you look thru pin hole get sighting  n t see thru pinhole wear glasses  if glasses see thru  re near sighted like n t able see far distance tell re sighting 
5,i use this level on my job site to shot grade on drit or pipe the view throw the sight is clear and close up is spard
3,it might best hand level  job  ca n t better price  does problems front lens getting scratched 
3,here s the lowedown  woman fifth   a drama psychological thriller dvd review    liked it  genre   movie what s  a college lecturer flees paris scandal costs job  in city light  meets widow might involved series murders what i think  this could movies still n t understand s  i found scratching head i dandruff asking   was psychological supernatural   i would even say foreign film   french it seemed filmed foreign movie would   abstract obscure  if n t mind subtitles   go 
2,at wimpy minutes  much left unless ve read book  lot happening probably n t make sense avoid movie  definitely read book favorite author douglas kennedy
1,i never given movie star   woman fifth  offers little way plot relevancy matter  the characters flat  dull  dialog less inspiring  this movie nothing  literally  there back story characters  motivation actions lack  nothing  just nothingness  and ends thankfully 
1,save money time  this nonsense attempting arty important  i d forgotten dire actor hawke  save time  there explanation direction  honey boo boo better writin 
2,very disappointed movie  the book great i anticipated movie would well  especially seeing going star movie very disappointed  slow moving movie  lots missing  
2,i attracted movie stars  i read book  i view movies basis perceived entertainment value  unfortunately  entertaining  believable  even so called psychological drama  it s first time i ve ever disappointed kristen scott thomas  save money 
1,i using exuviance products couple years satisfied feel i found skin products i intend use future  but  unfortunately i bad experience i ordered products amazon com  dealer called impossible discounts   rejuvenating treatment masque  hydrating eye complex clarifying facial cleanser  all three products dirty outer box sealing  actually  products looked used  i sent complaint exuviance  got reply two months since i sent complaint  i afraid i buy exuviance buying amazone incident 
4,there fancier  lighter  comfortable  adjustable headlamps puts enough ligh find way dark sooooo cheap
4,the light better using personal source light  the  larger ones i got glaringly brighter lots fun 
5,in  i successfully climbed mt  rainier  reaching  true  summit  it took several attempts weather  it hard work  but reading lene s book  i came realize strenuous physically challenging climb everest  i aware work risks taken prepare final assault  lene proved  showing incredible strength  fortitude emotion  there must terrible sense despair fear knowing death probably inevitable help available lene gives reader another perspective awesome event  using professional knowledge clinician writer  i would recommend everyone followed climbing event  either past magazine articles stories  several books written everest climb  read book 
2,lene probobly upbeat interesting person book choppy n t grip like books if everest books go ahead get ll enjoy high exposure breashears climb anatoli b much better
2,after nearly obsessed into thin air the climb  i eagerly awaited latest book lene  i lived speak danish  added bonus   however  i found lene s chronicle pretty weak  little background insight writing  this book written like journal without analysis billed  for gaining insight state mind lene  interesting  for better writing deeper analysis tragedy  stick  books 
2,this book climbing  i found kinda funny book mt  everest  book ms gammelgaard proving  could first nordic woman set foot  chomolungma  big deal  so maybe call driven  achieving lady singlemindedly pursues goal  learn nothing happened may  mt  everest like  even close krakauer s boukreev s books topic  buy instead 
1,as another woman actually reached summit mt  everest  i found book nothing self indulgent  new age  drivel  gammelgaard offers insight disaster happened virtualy ignores climbers everest day  the book none gripping suspense into thin air none factual reporting the climb  i m happy gammelgaard survived turn attentions things writing  one worst books i ve yet read 
1,this book total waste time read  i could n t wait read i saw amazon com  but lucky i happen see library hurried home read  gammelgaard makes sick  to think thinks scott fischer needed team order expedition make unreal  she never league true mountaineers like fischer rob hall  save money  i read almost everything mount everest  tragedy  far worst  it never compare  into thin air    the climb   also style writing i never seen  she jumps thing another  i guarantee always  strong great 
1,i n t read book i ve read krakauer  boukreev least  times  it public knowledge lene g pay mountain madness full fee guided mountain  ask karen dickenson  maybe s fischer s expedition  inferior  radios  hopefully lg paid mountain madness  fact  profits book  otherwise s user used fischer s good nature sleaze way expedition  even paid  s late  i zero respect  i would like read book i n t buy 
1,the book poorly written lot dropping gossipy insinuations  into thin air  climb  high exposure better written far interesting  i think figures refers  mother goddess  enough times pass book feminist treatise  lucky gammelgaard  s better climber writer  d another fossil mountain  do n t waste money 
2,after reading into thin air  i read everything i could get hands regarding everest tragedy  i turned  armchair everest junkie   lene s perspective survival particular interest i chicken comes taking risks  this book lene liked thought little  there little credible information shed light went  i found distasteful took shots accompanied collectively staked lives bid everest summit  true  anatoli fine mountaineer human person respected  that pretty much sums book 
1,like several others reviewed book  i found total waste time  i able read entire book day i kept thinking    s got get better   never  there sense drives woman  personal history  get know  certainly nothing added everest story  either historically context tragedy  i found shallow filled exclamation points made point  while i certainly understand accept intuitive mind differences analytical perspective  book little way informing mountain author  instead seems trite superficial filled pithy statements insinuations discredit perspective  i  however  thrilled made summit returned safely fulfilled personal quest  i wish n t written poorly 
3,the disjointed  dispatch  style put little first  get used  book hums right along  although writing technically others ve written may  gammelgaard gave reader real sense climber might feel  i simply ignored psychogibberish  operates sort rehab clinic  feel good inner god hogwash expected  endless references  sagamartha  mother goddess earth  enjoyed book  of course  i borrowed library  i might kind i shelled real money  so pay overdue fines  give try 
2,there s much shallow account everest tragedy  the book features double spacing paragraphs  apparently make long enough considered book  if like reprints  page itinerary scott fisher sent author  book  if great writing events  read into thin air  far superior  the author little add new insight tragedy  fact moments gripping  group lost mountain  amount little  yelled hours stay awake could live storm   this would made decent magazine article  n t amount good book 
1,i purchased book looking new perspective tragic everest climb may  i sorely disappointed  perhaps denmark people interested  female dane  attempted summitted mt  everest  however  novelty  climber everyone else  woman climbing everest guided expedition nonexistent  after hundreds ascents everest  approaches absurdity author repeatedly mention first danish woman summit those like read self help books may enjoy spin  inner game  preparing everest  i n t 
4,i recommend book anyone interested getting miller  there many great examples works  without commitment entire book  henry really handle means human 
4,i fan perumov s  i books bookshelf     however re fan like  wait read doom gods land without happiness get warrior great darkness  still  get ve finished two  hjorward experience complete finish vvt  bottom line  a good read  although nick s best 
4,this superb album brilliantly written songs i find easy relate  raymond always writes songs heart people knew would love music  okay might quite simple songs something say although country western really thing  different i n t see country i grown listening raymond froggratt songs album i find hard listen  bit cheesey songs like everybody losing  you sing blue  beautiful songs say lot  definately worth listening like songs good lyrics straight heart 
4,the year follow wagon train wends way across country oregon territory  along way experience indian attacks  disease much death  good things well  romance bravery  binns tells story well great feeling characters  he great feel trail well  s said writing novel binns drove good distance across oregon trail  seeing sights would later write first hand  as work literature genre piece  novel succeeds handsomely

1,i bought book write frm exam  it worst possible written book i ever seen  even topics i good knowledge  e g  duration  convexity etc   written disjointed fashion i could recognise  the author uses symbols without describing  passages relevance examples turn connected solutions  it great disappointment  i wonder anybody garp ever reviewed recommending text frm exam 
1,is anything less star  for errors  book good value moneyi agree readers  book full errors irony errors corrected downloadable supplement  available garp web site  agreed book covers everything within body knowledge frm exam  many important issues  theories mentioned  covered handbook part syllabus sufficient justice done  one definately gets strong feeling continuity missing certain parts book seem product simple copy  paste action i strongly recommend garp  wiley finance correct errors replace current book error free version  why readers pay errors  and please let readers know actions taking 
1,as comparing exam oriented books cfa aicpa exam  would poor book i read  the book poorly prepared organized  while organized according exam  structure  still difficult reader follow  most concepts insufficient explanation  while notations clearly explained  topics explained  jumped  fast without proper elaboration  some examples even supported adequate reading examples explanation found answers  thus  made chapter pieces becomes difficult reader memorize  i doubt garp recommend candidates since whether suitable sufficient exam  preparation purposes  i suggest serious candidates may required refer textbooks even planning 
1,this book cost frm last year  i made center study program  the book s writing atrocious  gaps covered  many errors misstatements  i wasted six weeks struggling book  when i finally realized mistake  late rescue study program  i failed exam  i disillusioned jorion garp  this shoddy  overpriced paperback makes think money  this year  i signed cfa exam instead  so far  i impressed study materials 
3,jorion s book indispensable   experience  sufficient  preparing frm exam  taking  think  an added bonus impressive number typos errors test knowledge  
2,this book misleading  contains impressive amount errors  leads readers learn wrong concepts  i starting doubt book written phd  or  lets revoke title  hope release decent review

1,this book frm reading list  the author already book garp exam  covers material much manner  there little new  it regurgitating stuff  the message seems  n t make sense first book  shell  give second chance  save money  it worth 
5,you go wrong mr stuart wilde s teachings  each book writes tapes cd produces jewel  he s great teacher tapes really help seeks knowledge living courageously awareness 
1,sorry   i gave album spins i still n t think good thing say  except maybe probably weirdest thing ll ever hear   n t say s original  case s necessairly good thing  if re familiar band  probably would n t best album start 
1,beware  this game work windows xp  the vendor said would work xp version except media center  i xp pro crashes despite changing compatibility settings older versions changing video resolution  i suspect s like another game purchased worked fine xp first came  windows auto update changed something destroyed compatibility old win games like this we running year old laptop win   s cpu intensive run properly old thing the game seems ok right pc operating system though  
2,the story contained book excellent  book junk  it appears visually scanned older narrowly formatted print pasted print little error checking  the worst result every word hyphenated across two lines original text appears broken hyphenated even though middle line  e g  hyphen ated   you see occasional misreads number place lowercase  l   find another printing 
1,the soft back edi tion book full misedit copy  full sep arated text  annoying n t    it publication date full title page  i wrote report using date date i could find  lastly  whole portions text missing edition  my advice  spend extra money get different edition 
3,stephens   crock gold  interesting little amalgam cosy irish folktale  celtic mythology  hero s quest  what makes unusual  course book  three different heroes  male female  undertake separate life altering journeys  the characters interesting eccentricities  struggles present different morals life  the ending   diffuse decide sort allegory author intended  a pleasant little bedtime reading 
3,the book got good time upon looking book pages missing gift daughter  picture graph projects  i remember reading missing pages

3,this camera good looses signal fast  sound fine plane  its security camera  model airplane  camera  you get pay cameras  i think cheep 
1,this wireless camera works  ft away receiver  it supposedm  what point wireless close 
1,i recently ordered camera hoping i could fly helicopter controlling close range  well i sure wrong  camera gets fuzzy hardly tell whats goingft away behind helicopter box  i disappointed hope warn potential buyers range terrible barely broadcast window let alone room right beside  unless big room camera receiver placed  worth  i saying it range near ft like saying  maybe could tell whats going ft obstructions sitting still  otherwis i recommend anyone i planning returning camera 
4,the camera works fine easy setup use  i m good distances i m guessing range ft
2,i purchased wireless camera use medium size model helicopter  unfortunately range quality video quite weak  even smallest movement camera causes video destabilize lose detail  might good fixed location 
2,it s d expect  almost signals around interfere video audio camera  i takes much adjusting every little move camera makes impossible view moving toy like helicopter rc vehicle product states plus rc products emit signals cause video interruption  not good product  will careful cameras i buy next 
2,great concept  however  tuning imposable  get horizontal instability  time  get  looks decent 
2,i like platformers  i got game  i ve played week  i hate finishing something i start  if n t fact  i d never touch game  the graphics good  camera controls  bad   i ve died game decided adjust camera angle i middle crossing tiny bridge climbing narrow ledge 
2,well yea sure supposed wonderfull  amazing  groundbreaking platform game  well  thats changed graphics  besides general opening almost development storywise  tecnically speaking revolutionary platform actoin games like rayman titles  ratchet clank  all probably would pretty fun thus add two stars new kind thing  add stars really really really like large environments platforming general 
1,basically  say game  fun  frustrating  the gameplay uneccesarily difficult times ceases fun   levels  the camera terrible  some said dismiss oh well  platform games camera problems   however  game definately lamest camera all another dissapointment fact milestones  if  expire   get start  period  no matter many lives left  many items collected matter far level gotten  get erased zero get distinct pleasure wasted time  is n t fun  acclaim definately failed foray platform gaming  get ratchet clank rayman  actually enjoy games  this looked like potential frustrating  do n t waste money game  it n t worth 
4,i tired people talking bad camera angles  there n t game n t get  this game best platform games i seen  i played way jak  daxter sly cooper without hardly thinking  both great games way easy  vexx great game actually somewhat challenging  not say n t s easy parts  i hope see sequal  if like platformers got play 
4,this cool  fun game  much vein ratchet  clank jak daxter  the problems maddening camera angles  tough control  feshman swimming controls  and n t bother prima strategy guide  it s basic  dose n t cover controls  skims walk throughs  it seems slapped together meet deadline 
1,unable use television  advertisement n t advise needed special television play game 
2,i purchased e version book read kindle  there numerous spelling errors two words combined  the intothe book theworse got  two three errorsper page  i believe spell checkwould pickedthese allup 
4,i read book utopian lit class high school thought represented totalitarian views well  i like winston gave fighting hard try make changes  i see world entirely possible not so distant future  the way society set  way change  the telescreens  already use terms security cameras  hidden cameras  etc  it really easy find anything anybody today  this quite scary 
5,enter world past  where past present  follow winston thinks thought crime  works fake documents  plots shut system  big brother s eyes follow winston everywhere goes  if see wether winston accomplishes mission  must read book  after read book go check movie  but n t see movie unless ve read book else idea going movie 
4,scary almost real could near future  it clear depiction politician s overzealous control beginning run lives 
3,this book prophetic many ways  the ideas big brother war peace described society developing  the bleakness story adds futuristic vision  i recommend book analyze society governments 
1,while cultural pundits try convince literature better literature  truth art relative individial tastes  thus  n t make sense think novel like really better say  michael crichton stephen king  aesthetic standards n t grounded thus  n t listen anyone tries distinguish  serious  works literature like allegedly  lesser  novels  the distinction entirely illusory  novels  better  others  concept  great novel  intellectual hoax  this book n t good harry potter my opinion  refute  tastes relative 
1,198 boring book  their parts book catch attention gets boring  i n t really like futuristic based books book perfect example  i would n t recommend book  unless type genre  i give book  
1,i never read excited regret purchasing edition  in forward  thomas pynchon  entire ending revealed great detail  i knew expect entire book i really wish i could get money back  dont buy centennial edition  least dont read forward nice surprising read 
3,i bought book great story front cover  the story fine  apart odd page preface  front cover nothing like pictured  most disappointingst birthday present brother born  not happy 
3,i tend like books action way book written  i feel like i hard time grasping full meaning intended author  having said  impression opinion grain salt this book expression feeling  good story  the idea government watching everybody time fascinating albeit ridiculous  he seemed express hoplessness toward mans future  extreme cynicism reasons  he clearly socialist  i wonder george orwell would said way england  israel deal terrorists  ok i m soapbox   i would recommend book anybody interested conspiracies  fact classic

2,can say i enjoyed reading book  i approve lot things author included  however  i find main points interesting create story  but definitely type good book read  would i recommend 
2,i found intriguing book  the plot book interesting  how author went telling story slow  i found hard pay attention reading  throughout entire book bits intereseting parts followed several paragraphs  found  random information  i though great plot storyline n t liking

3,198 desent book  the caution ever letting totalitarianist government power arching theme book  there several thought provoking passages made think world new way  however plot charcters seemed dull uninteresting  this n t book i would recomend anyone wants casual book read book make think little good book choose 
4,198 great read compelling  it little hard going times  the characters little frustrating thus making little annoying read  still great classic well worth persuing 
3,the book tries send good message future  orwell warns giving government ability destroy privacy control us  yet  i found htat book slow times  i almost force read 
1,amazon offered kindle e book reader  electronic version s publisher decided n t make book available way  so amazon deleted book kindles customers already purchased credited accounts  a small problem  annotations people made book term papers  a big problem  i buy book liberal amazon decides like books conservatives  delete book player  this despicable action  i boycotting amazon publicly change policy  there plenty places buy books online 
2,having grown former soviet union  soon i started reading book  i could tell immediately orwell drew inspiration  well details peoples  existence  reading book like re visiting childhood  well refreshing mother s grandmother s stories soviet life s  brainwashings  terrible living conditions  propaganda  people disappearing middle night  etc  basically  orwell took soviet reality  took notches  twisted  art imitates life  speak  i m sure everyone credits orwell s imagination   either way  book extremely boring  plot almost non existent  nothing really going   unlikely  love affair took half the book unfold  n t even worth 
4,good condition book  look forward passing kids  grandkids  etc media begins get censored usa   coming soon  know 
5,it good book  it favorite book ever  i feel cultured i read 
3,although slow start help  swept events transpire orwell s  especially potentiality arise societal faction  the story line climax necessarily draws reader  instead possible reality situation portrayed  moreover  although tends lean towards  could never happen  scenario s disturbing easily mass people lead like inferior animal sheep  disturbing events history  poignantly holocaust  support docile nature human whole  this novel thought provoking literally captivating  it s questions posed conclusion novel make must read even words cover 
4,despite extremity orwell depicts totalitarian state  story speaks much smaller level well  day age brainwashing among civilized countries ignored despite presence  important novel  studies shown humans  like chimps  gaining following dominant position society  shows humans extreme  of course novel use exaggeration stress point  and quite effectively  i might add  the fantastic  climax culmination smith s life 
3,well  i forced read english class high school  welp  bored hell  though  i d say everything indeed overwhelming much time  perhaps years old something  would liked  i dunno  n t appeal much  i understand point novel  fear governments taking unjustly   s details  gooood    anyway  reccommend book behind everything  premise something think  
3,  my recent novel not intended attack socialism british labour party  i supporter  show up perversions centralised economy liable already partly realised communism fascism  i believe kind society i describe necessarily _will arrive  i believe  allowing course fact book satire  something resembling _could arrive    g o  letter francis a henson  june  this orwell s best book  i ve read three times  never failed underwhelmed  try _down out paris london  _homage catalonia _a collection essays insightful writing  stay away satires  _animal farm   
3,orwell good job setting  characterization  images throughout novel  fails elaborate plot  this took away story  everything else top notch  great book 
3,this book entertaining  hardly prophetic  the world like even close  anybody thinks needs learn world the problem dystopic vision orwell really n t understand technology way affects world 
1,it good description life anti social time
1,198 worst book i ever read  i would advise anyone thinking reading book reconcider  george orwell bad writer  however  book evry well  others  prehaps getting old lost touch  animal farm okay  horrible  it took forever  seemed like  get accual book  if someone useless part  would half long  why would wirte much nothing  i havent ever meet someone could wirte boring book goverment  i meet many people loved book  dispised  i intrested goverment  this may part reason i didnt like  i would advise read book 
3,198  n t anything exciting title  why would buy book called  i ll tell  because unique interesting book  it different idea author  george orwell  thought year going like  though know really  still interesting  this book follows named winston horrible conditions world living  could world turn something horrible  telescreens everywhere  watching everything  thought police get  it sure makes wonder  it s almost   scary 
4,although images profound grammar language usage rather basic  holds novel together plot  intelligent ideas  unique  beautifully flawed characters  i loved fatal relationship julia winston  mostly unsentimental virtually realistic  i n t think orwell romanticizes anything  alluding perhaps bleak style life led book   the denouement two stunning  yet tragic   the novel ends melancholic  similarly unhappy note  epitomizes main idea presented  really happy endings  sometimes winner  winston  anti hero  already dull beginning  goes full circle  culminating conclusion full orwellian grace sadness  perhaps ending best part  leaves reader feeling like world  fact  real never ending  clearly  orwell s point 
5,to call work science fiction  technically accurate  somewhat disservice book  chillingly accurate glimpse future hellish totalitarianism  quite amazingly  passing generation actually seems become relevant  it regarded great literature  oracle real storm clouds consistently looming overhead  but perhaps importantly  serve much needed kick groin anyone constantly blinded bright lights patriotism   greed  fear  forms propaganda science fiction  n t fiction 
4,the best science fiction book i ve read  sci fi i ve read   it actually quite good 
4,people always talk books n t put defenitly books  you really feel scared winston throughout entire story  it made cringe times sneaking around  the thing made unrealistic sex love eliminated totally party  it goes human nature  was everybody tortured like winston party make way  anyway great book makes think
4,i sat read george orwell s novel tuesday night family dinner next room  for following hours  dinner conversation interrupted bursts anger frustration   how call destruction words beautiful    i cried  orwell writes convincingly frightens reader thinking   what oceania really existed form  how could i break free oppression  mindlessness  fear anger surrounds aspects life   it creates level paranoia  especially since happy ending  the main character  winston  never freed bondage brainwashed held captive mind  for free think  free  however  i think orwell succeeds best terrifying us point sure count blessings sure granted beauty words  thoughts  freedom 
5,george orwell another hit  animal farm glimpse intellectual genius  this story takes carefully regulated emotional rollercoster  you go intense shock indignation characters involved  this small glimpse orwell considered inevitable future left strong sense denial  everything telescreen watches every move mere thought  thought police  force gave shivers  there several interesting implications example use term called  doublethink  implies people hold two contradictory thoughts heads time beleive true  overall book amazing peice work  never time put unless  would definitely recommend person wants mind ride 
5,george orwell master english language  superb style writing intensity story sustained throughout the novel covers timeless issue  orwell attempts shock us extremities exist totalitarian society whose ultimate purpose obtain power  perhaps issues  mentioned afterthought  relevant areas apart totalitarianism  perhaps capitalism class distinction money representative power these issues covered  proving orwell s brilliant writing genius 
5,george orwell attention first last page novel  fascinating mind inducing novel  the story winston smith s struggle life oceania extremely captivating thought provoking  orwell s sharp  detailed descriptions paint image unforgettably unique society  his story detailed description living worst case scenario communistic society  orwell s ideas images extremely brilliant  his extreme communist society brainwashes citizens become emotionless  violent  thoughtless  i mesmerized way society dehumanized citizens  people freedom ever  the concept people inability think  loves  express engaging  i found extremely thrilling novel  i recommend anyone interested classic contemplative piece literature 
4,i thought book great  it really made think weather i pro big brother big brother  at book i decided diagree big brother  it powerful controling  there forms big brother think nothing n t even re around even though s watching every move  awsome book kept getting better interesting every page 
3,overall  interesting story however  i found parts super cheesy  parts book  phrases written author seemed written intent making super deep  human  philosophical point  for taste  author clearly delivers points   n t leave enough wrenching analysis thought formation reader  some points blatantly delivered i could n t help cringe  look away text  say  ohh     not nearly elegant huxley brave new world 
4,  it s beautiful thing destruction words  this appelation coming mouth character syme seems strange author intone  tantamount writer s heresy  in way  whole book heresy  thoughtcrime  towards regime ruled airstrip one  this book able teach lot politics modern day  the place really strays orwell s atheistic uterances  otherwise great read 
4,pros  this book seemed science fiction book future  truth  sci fi symbolism totalitarianism orwell s time  yet  book timely today  it reminded way bush friends control thoughts smart words  good americans believe traitors believe causes  we always keep opinion forget always swaying popular opinion  and one many things i learned great book  i highly suggest book cons  it bit repetitive s heavy read 
4,at time book written  s  book feared posssible future world  this story bleak prediction future  whatever say rule  whatever think ungaurdable  even smallest change apperence subject search  the biggest question though  escapes  escape  they know everthing telescreens located every room thought treason picked  this story world  alone  trying figure  he knows party lies  even alter past  world alliances wavor  certainty  know fighting right people  even trust someone  another problem   big brother watching  
4,long i read  i read brave new world anthem  all three similar subject matter  bleak future  both brave new world depict technology run rampant used de humanize populous  bleak book  parts powerful  i would say  however  times orwell lost interest  he love narrative  fine  occasionally drones  i would say brave new world better book read future can go wrong  mainly much entertaining  but integrity  especially ending 
5,198 biggest achievement eric blair novelist anybody even slightly interested politics  history future give read  i think books n t skip reading watch movie  very detailed  thorough  challenging  book years old  yet current  i ve read  times  paperback copy amazon definitely nicest edition i ve  printed something looks like recycled paper  roughly cut printed weird  nice font  i recommend buying 
5,this great book  i ordered cassette i could listen long road trip product arrived right time great condition 
5,first novel ever finished  tend read first pages quickly move   yes  like winter london heavy smog  novel gloomy  cold  bit cynical perspective  s something pulling  s secret love winston julia  beautiful  soon crushed like flower fat tires  though  
2,the kindle edition incredibly sloppy  there blatant typos i m surprised n t noticed editors  real slap page numbers  print edition  middle sentences someone n t bother removing copy pasted book whatever file 
5,198 a good example government may  good warnings may happen government given much power may completely without noticed  depressing gives good insight  read it  
5,across country travesty going  high school teachers requiring students read animal farm george orwell  by author much finer example satire multiple levels orwell attached books  nineteen eighty four simply best books written century  it approaches subject matter  communism  attacks inadvertantly exposes greater meaning truth  essence freedom  orwell meant attack russia would happen stalin lenin  it trascended became handbook freedom  if anyone n t libertarian reading book  n t read close enough  one many books classic reading lists centuries 
5,i wish way amazon would let rate one book six stars  all time favorite  if  would pick  i ve read least four times  i insomnia i read whole thing front back  the first time i read high school  i disappointed n t happy ending  smith n t manage somehow smash big brother  but i recognize book  timeless statement totalitarianism individualism  do n t let title fool  re  careful happen yet 
4,obviously great book  kindle edition  least  omits appendix  the principles newspeak  reader 
5,george orwell s  nineteen eighty four  brilliant warning totalitarianism  it certainly communism  you tell physical descriptions big brother stalin goldstein trotsky  at time many people admired soviet union  george orwell saw soviet system was brutal dictatorship based fear  however  communism  it warning totalitarian systems thought seek impose forcibly particular ideology people mould people  winston smith s struggle hold objective truth world lies human decency world cruelty symbolises real life struggle many people century brought us horrors gulags auschwitz 
5,this book tells us person s total thinking altered means simple tool called torture 
5,in opinion orwell s best novel favorite book  it happen us long power hungry human beings world 
3,this decent book written well  times i put book becuase interesting parts  but side i thought far inbetween becuase kinda slow paced i would lose interest something else  i found forcing read  becuase i school  rather read enjoyment  another negative book pasted nothing like kind ruins i would given book   stars i read sometime i bet good book back  but i think people would really enjoy i understand alot people rated book higher i i personally didnt feel book 
3,george orwell looked ahead time totalitarianism might rule society  written  orwell wanted force people think possibility  real mind  government big brother could control thoughts actions  so actual gone  nothing happened quite like orwell might thought  still book gives us something think somebody watch  be careful  big brother watching 
2,i depressed week i finished completing novel  the torture protagonist endures much digest  i thankful terrifying vision n t fruition   yet oddly enough  i trying finish final pages book  i began reading  the partner   main character endure series torture get crack 
2,i read george orwells book  i didnt really like book due fact total negative outlook throughout whole book  his prediction future little far fetched  that book wasnt really style  i see book liked many people i would recommend due fact everyone different opinions  this book negative outlook future wasnt wanted read 
2,i think book bad book  not unrealistic  boring book  orwell imaginative mind  i must say  thuis book talks  published things totalitarism  how could know would still exact thing  this book strange events  the author skipped around many times  at sentence  would appartment winston s home  without telling reason  would else  the book boring  there enough action suspense make reader willing read 
3,this first time i ordered book online little hesitant due time restraints  my daughter needed george orwell s school unable find local bookstore  tried ordering internet  supposedly delivery delayed began wonder would get within days deadline  the book arrived  days new condition saved day

4,i bought wife really wanted read book  she loved book could hardly put  just wish price bit affordable kindle book  convenience really nice 
3,this book considered classic i understand  however slow parts fast read  i recommend reading least 
3,excellent insight  predictions  abuse technology people power  applicable present day governments  human interest story  scare tactic  lost stilted prose overuse impersonal  third person  dogmatic passages  running paragraphs 
1,this book old  gross looking  cover page torn the condition definitely not good got book     it s worth cents sure 
2,this book essentially  the brave new world  expressed totally different way  somehow  i like  the brave new world  better  it gave totally different view 
3,ok strange  it imaginary future world everyone controlled brainwashed love serve big brother  all humanness removed  poverty  suffering  torture make population zombie like easy manipulate  the language changed records  books  etc abolished  the story although strange thought provoking bring question human alive really means 
3,although book  george orwell  arrived good condition described  book cover pictured  this book updated cover shown website  book thought purchasing  although text reads  print type smaller therefore page numbers different two books  we purchased book classroom use thus making difficult follow instructor refers certain passages page numbers 
4,i think orwell spent  much time developing world language  new speak  enough time story chartacters  this quite simple book stright foreward  the characters seem unrealistic likeable  world amazing s intricate structure  he planned oceania last detail  if spent amount time story charactersthen this would definite calssic   i still say i found amazing reviewers  but great introduction literature  n t classroom setting kills enjoyment reading
4,the numerous references novel pop culture make must read  in addition  discussion afterword erich fromme well informed added presence novel  i definitely recommend 
1,198 creative well written book  winston smith main character insignifacant member ruling party london nation oceania  everywhere goes video taped cameras called  big brother  party  this books talks winston thinks  big brother  unfair  i enjoyed reading book  creative well written  it makes appreciate i life  i wound n t like situation wiston put watch time  i reccommend book people willing threw boring parts love science fiction  overall good book  i n t think iam ever going read book 
1,attempting read book worse watching grass grow  at least grass become something enjoy  the title plotline story intrigued read  do n t get wrong  well written  storyline could interesting  but even ten pages  thought going mind  when guy shut tell story     the plot comes distant second narrator s monotone  seemingly unending monologue  if i could withstand  i believe i would enjoyed  but forgive kind patience hundreds pages 
2,i read the book    by george orwell  the book was about a guy named winston who found a diary and wrote his feeling in it which was strictly forbidden  i thought the book was rather boring and confusing to read  i didnt understand most of the things he was talking about  when reading the book i suggest that you pay close attention so that you understand it completely and wont be confused 
1,i never read bigger piece garbage entire life  for people read enjoyed book   get a life 
1,george orwell s book wonderful book set england s future ww ii never stopped  the main character book  winston  ordinary worker regular office england  the catch remember past  in england s future ruled knowing named big brother bb new speak  language oceania earlier called england  once winston realizes chick named julia likes start secretively dating rules party  winston finally realizes going society bb  winston girlfriend finally get nerve chance join resistance party  in n t turn expects inevitable the book great read good use time  i personally think big brother  even though school assignment read great

3,upon reading i found questioning many things different economic social societies  when george orwell wrote  ideas communism beginning become known many people questioned capitalism  this greatly reflected book  however  so called hero book  winston  wasnt really hero  in  brainwashed lost sense individual thought  this prove  evils  capitalism the biggest problem book i feel outdated great impact society today due increasing rise capitalism fall several communist countries  it presents extreme idea  likely 
3,i read book first time noting comparisons various friends journalists made system government book system american government evolving but book lacks subtlety hits readers head details tyranny  no doubt  orwell writes way underscore dangers complete trust government  i find plot far fetched unbelievable  no form government could ever gather resources achieve efficiency needed monitor individual way party  would n t realistic cautionary effective entertaining 
3,i liked idea book  i hated  the hopeless feeling important  i think ideas learned  i like story human spirit triumphs  i like read book heroism  this fine people like bad endings  me there many elements believable  three totalitarian states would constantly maintain equal power  a society oceania would weaken either states would gain supremacy  another would rise up i originally rated book  stars  change  i n t stop thinking  though i think things could done differently  i say book deeply affected 
5,wow first phrase came mind finishing book  it best i ever read certainly favorite read last year  i sure everyone knows plot i rehash  but i knew general plot beforehand i e   big brother  thought police  i still overwhelmed  orwell s writing makes keep coming back  always eager find current situation turn  happen next  besides sketch tyrannical government using mass propaganda literally brainwash citizens  orwell shows powerless ordinary citizen becomes  much trouble must gone engage illegal conduct  brutal aftermath getting caught  and love story  i expected weakest part book  actually fascinating heartbreaking  a must read ever 
4,if read  i strongly recommend   especially like  somehow  escaped  assigned either high school college  always wondered hype about too many times today  hear book discarded bunch prophesies way  e g  year would computers  telescreens  would read minds   big brother  would always watching us  many  i m sure  feel since not case today  orwell book  wast time as  i read  i see overall concept  big brother    i e  information  cleansed    protect  us  teaching technology out smart  least  stay step ahead us  is  fact  all too real lives today  in case  intriguing

2,why make high school kids  whose lives already fraught uncertainty uneasiness  read depressing books  i suppose back  fresh new picture totalitarianism  today pick newspaper see story modern world  it s i think orwell n t relevant  s i think high school english teachers could little research  find books well written  expand horizons  lift people  depress  maybe books would help kids  vulnerable age  laugh  become wiser  look others compassion   cold sassy tree  comes mind  something warmth  humor wisdom  rather bleakness 
5,orwell dead on vision possible future western world  indeed  according recent events  big brother here voting republican 
4,in book  george orwell paints dark future human kind novel  one must wonder accurate  society s future  he shows gov t alter past quickly present occurs still maintain full power s people  today world going direction book depicts  exact destination  going opposite way  one think worry situation  appear society heading towards orwell wrote many years ago  the people oceania book governed telescreens monitoring everybody s moves giving rules abide  this book depicts communist gov t guess future  i personally really enjoyed book  it books kept attention every page  this definately book intelligent reader  end

4,even read  many years   revaltions book hold scarily true  big brother vs personal freedom  scary topic 
3,the book george orwell way funny  it somewhat odd mysterious  funny  it funny george orwell viewed future  he described secret organizations  i believe book good literature  gave weird outlook year  as example george orwell writes   winston feared life thought police would track dared keep writing diary   even person loves reading could odd ways history could happened  george orwell classic  i recommend  for prefer realistic novel  like  aim another author book choice 
3,this depressing books i ve ever read  present excellent discussion conspiracy power  i think george orwell little faith mankind 
4,after reading book first time i inspired vividness characterization  reading second time i enjoyed book much  the striking feature book countries type totalitarian state far future  left small  apparent truth  orwell trying show life would  projection exaggeration tendencies changes years  it would shame miss book matter 
3,198 live s reputation  i ll grant orwell point  _western societies  well soviet society headed toward future   however  orwell great novelist  excellent essays  poor novels  almost entire plot stolen earlier russian work  we  yevgeny zamyatin   far superior  if re interested orwell s political thinking  yes  s socialist   check essays  if re looking good allegory  do n t get   
4,george orwell s      classic detailed adventure leave asking  the story set london winston  main character  works big brother  but soon finds questioning big brother works for winston tried blend crowd really stand  but winston starts remember childhood  begins question big brother  winston soon finds wondering life like big brother  but unless takes real chance  way changing anything one flaw i found book detail  i like lot detail  book overdid  i would soon found thinking things book

2,okay book random sex  destruction human nature  ending morales  however i must admit orwell prphetic sense camr idea watched constantly government  this book lacked decent plot well  ths book should not be read unless you love the destrction of the wonderful human nature god created 
2,this well written book  i trouble understanding  the begining n t bad  i read less i enjoyed 
3,i viewed book mainly pleasant romantic novel  but i found main character winston arrogant shallow though orwell made sure character believable  generally well thought book  though areas  taken thought police simple obvious lacking imagination  anybody could written section  lacked originality however  i thought system government well organised well thought seems like efficient effective method ruling  although  harsh unfair something would like see practise  cold harsh effective in conclusion romantic story upsetting places  i cried julia captured

5,stephen bradley  i first read book im i still n t read another book  every time i read i find another piece clever symbolism  i would recommend book anyone  i incredibly awed clever uses english symbolic meanings  for example i told gin thought downfall british working class  it would shallow understanding book claim anti socalist book orwell  eric blair  obviously cared working class pretentous totalatarian states  i invite like minded people discuss book  i apolagise carless grammar spelling  im    
5,here book first got thinking politics philosophy this orwell s dystopia feared world would become run group cahooting despots the main character  winston smith  lives london dictatoeship run  big brother   in state love love big brother  there excitment patriotism  chocolate rationed orgasms banned  in world smith somehow manages fall love  s start problems warns us wary might freedom whilst trying convince us actually gaining extra liberty  buy 
3,winston party member government controls thoughts citizens  he works diligently falls love julia  he ignors duties disobeys society  they find freedom  last  the society book interesting depressing   the characters believable personalities  if like happy books n t read though  it s depressing politcal well written 
3,the dismal  totalitarian way life orwell s sad seemed discouraging comes realize much foretold already pass yet  n t live concentration camplike society yet  many vanished like orwell s great book  animal farm  even wells  the time machine  paints picture society might certain directions taken and like good satire  alerts us make sure directions n t taken 
3,198 far wierdest books ve ever read  younger reader book first real science fiction novels itwas pretty good  i read book part summer reading list  read page start confused  when started get pretty good book  usally rate books hooked first  pages  still n t hooked way passedth chapter  this first book george orwell  going try work better picture writing 
3,198 kind book i admire like  i admire orwell detailed believable world builds  for efforts set dark unsettling mood detailed analysis politics the reasons i n t like much many people  well  n t anything  i could n t relate feel anything characters  i n t find story haunting particularly appealing  it n t even make think  i reading books like bradbury s fahrenheit camus  the fall i close every pages think  i could n t hold thoughts back  n t happen all reading s subjective experience  matter good book  n t feel anything result reading  give high rating  i wish i d liked better  least spotted major reason dislike  i n t 
3,sorry i contribute lowering score classic  although main idea good  writing simplistic  reads like book teenagers  story characters lack depth quite boring i guess i m disappointed orwell n t better job brilliant idea   the part really interesting main character  winston  reading  prohibited  book  in section  orwell essentially details philosophy party leaders  s stimulating read  but apart segment  story mostly pointless 
4,eric a blair us favor back in194 wrote politicalnovel future tyranical society followed animal farm  another winner most orwell predicted has will  i hope  true  only con stitution stop  mr mrs america would will wake 
5,although brave new world written orwell s masterpiece  great merit aldous huxley  books show different views future  i consider much mature  when i started read  i could n t stop  it s intelligent  interesting very well written  besides  deals many  many issues  totalitarism  people use say  it deals loneliness  mass media power verbal language  i really like orwell s description profesional  building  new language  language limited would control human s thought  george orwell inspired wrote book  congratulations sensitive writer 
3,this book i first read young teen freshman high school  the main character emotionally bonding  in  tortured breaking integrity true love   do gloria   words still ring ears years later  this disturbing book first degree 
3,198 novels i intended read years  never gotten around  however  i finally managed get  better worse  orwell s dystopian novel left feeling rather prosaic  i m quite sure express feelings regarding text  in simplest terms  i n t like novel  i n t think i supposed  and i certainly n t regret taking time read 
4,198 without review i suppose  s around years s classic  so means must read  unless sensitive  tortures described leave strong sense impotence  the book surprising unexpected plot changes 
3,i ve heard alot things book  mostly friends read book told  i looking compare blind ideaology human nature  i found alot i looking human psyche i quite disappointed book literary piece  the using colorful expressions english language anti climactic left feeling ripped off  the cliftnotes would ve done well 
3,this book good piece propaganda  it fails gripping story  i found aldous huxley s brave new world far compelling read  real dystopean nightmare try slaughterhouse  kurt vonnegutt  starts well  final chapters seems reading orwell s anti totalitarean attitudes story left side  this book worth reading  i would n t accept reviewers comments best book world 
2,morningam dudes ninja suits came house stole copy book  i excited read amazon com stole 
2,i honestly dont like book type stuff like read  so thinking reading favorite book twilight series  eragon vampire diaries probably wont like either  i read 
1,ordered orwells may  card charged  recieve book  go refund  steve
5,to day  novel changed way i look society george orwell done     i highly recommend book 
3,i enjoyed book somewhat  it plenty current day predictions invetions  my needed school read 
2,i thought george orwell s   ok  book  i thought book little far fetched  his prediction negative i found really hard get  it difficult read simply lack interest  i think book may wonders people though  s really style  for part i ve always heard good things novel people  so i n t think book fantastic  n t let stop  i would advise read book see orwell s depiction strange negative utopia 
3,198 george orwell interesting book  why  unique way writeing views life would like  the book  however get boring  eben though book seems boring uneventful continue reading  gets exciting read  the story opens main character winston smith describes several things sees  bizarre letters words sees walls  later book meets finds love girl named julia  they join secret organization called brotherhood try throw government hate  the book continues expierences brotherhood troubles run 
2,ok  maybe mr orwell intended way  still n t hide fact book moves incredibly slow compared author s works  i read book i remember thoroughly enjoying understanding animal farm years ago  work recommended several friends  if unrealistic view future totally morbid depressing  check  yes  science fiction  people call classic n t mean i like  if best genre  i recommend dune   frank herbert   a space odyssey   arthur c clarke  enders game   orson scott card 
2,really slow service    took almost  weeks  and cover different displayed page numbers 
3,was good book  could plenty features like appendix quotes synopsis added  otherwise  good book  masterpiece orwell 
2,i thought dull cheesy book  every time i picked  i fell asleep  i read school  took forever get i ordered  barely finished time 
5,winston lives world constant survelence secret police  truth government says  actually happened  according  facts  produced government  country getting better  according memory  country getting worse  society brainwashed fear government incited anger enemy country yields   far extreme society many fear current societies headed  although fiction  fascinating look certain similar aspects current societies   nowhere near extreme book s society   good book terms keep society heading  truly great read terms perspective the downside i took book i bothered winston endured especially last pages book  never regret reading  definitely  happy book   i like eyes wide open 
5,what say book n t already said  it s dark  it s real dark  it s real  real dark  get flashlight  the future nice place fairytale  it  however  classic must read 
3,i bought book  weeks ago i m still  trying  read  it s depressing theme kind old  i m enthusiast  i born abroad required reading material i school  i m happy i ve never lived place like  hope gets better towards 
5,i believe people  many artists  arrive earth warn us future  george orwell  humanistic socialist  people  i write present tense although mr orwell left us  masterpiece works animal farm  remain  probably  great artistic works  long time the warning represents impending dystopia  evil abject  senseless  self serving brutality  threatens hold human society whenever people become complacent  the question heed warnings begin taking responsibility creating heaven earth  wallow dangerous complacency thereby enable bullies sheer love power 
4,this book great read  quite disheartening  the society described book inconceivable  s hard argue n t moving direction  i challenge anyone disagree reading open mind the highlight book manifesto main character  winston smith  must read  it shows orwell s ingenious insight mankind s role s oppression  i could n t help agree much said  time realizing much seemed trivialize work civil rights activists highly recommended  particularly enjoyed stories  v vendetta  movies like  american history x    the matrix   
4,198  written late s  shocking look possible future  this future independant thought outlawed  big brother  rules people oceania iron fist  one stands totalitarian government  can topple big brother  falls  this book really makes reader think read  today  ever expanding government  future far fetched possibility  do book much entertaining novel  rather warning events 
4,198 book based main character winston smith  winston lives oceania controlled totalitarian government  big brother  big brother become bad government language many devices monitor daily george orwell went conducting well eyes  this book pretty easy read really gets thinking things  what something like ever happend  what n t born u s a controlled like time  by orwell even able put sort image somebodies mind shows proves good writer really 
4,198 definitely book generate discussion  the topics form strong sometimes unexpected opinions  a parts bit dull  beginning  plot quite intriguing  george orwell utilizes superior language i loved way used example  mind control  throughout entire story ties loose ends concept  many different themes taking place time  everything associates main  big brother  government  i truly enjoyed reading novel  it refreshing change pace i m normally science fiction reader  despite  i would n t suggest knocking book sitting  even re avid reader  it get pretty hard focus  overall  though  i would definitely recommend  
4,the entire book good last chapter  least opinion  without giving ending  i n t feel orwell used characteristics character well  maybe i ll need re read book understand true meaning book i n t get first try  however  book well put together overall strong characters strong plot  it s scary  oceania  ever became world today 
2,as custom barth  book informative incredibly boring  the story basseri detailed interesting barth style say least engaging 
3,this book interesting times funny  n t expect anything shocking  i reccomend andy warhol s factory drag queens 
4,another great read jack polidoro  unbelievably uncanny long reading project samuel bruhaha ted williams  body death  a riveting novel  it scary see could happen human greed  jack remarkable job allowing reader get intimately know characters  once i anxiously await jack s next novel 
4,the premise cloning living celebrity kept interest way  the author s love baseball s heros evident  i could n t put  rush satisfying finish  looking forward polidoro 
2,i disappointed product it cakey cover blemishes regular make up it leaves streaks looks really unattractive i find hard apply 
2,doent cover goo light coverage wont buy sorry say good day  bye
5,bought disguise redness occurring rosacea  it good job used moisturizer primer covering redness cracking  recommend using primer moisturizer 
4,i really like concealer  it covers better i ve ever tried stays i wash  the reason i n t give  stars tend get bit cakey  i primarily got dark eye circles  be careful put light  thin layers around eye area  i small scar cheek covers completely  a little bit goes long way  
4,i ve using product years imagine ever without  i terrible dark circles eyes difference applying product remarkable  i highly recommend 
4,i ve using product couple years  i ve tried products always came back nothing else covers imprefections well  can bit chalky n t blend well use cover up full foundation 
5,product covers black allery eye circles perfectly without drying eye area  stays wash away 
4,this is by far my favorite concealer  does not crease at all  coverage could be a little better  but still a great product 
4,i always hard time finding concealer right  but concealer i found years ago  i ve using ever since  i dark bags eyes concealer helps lighten  definitely recommend 
4,very effective product cost effective  the smallest amount concealer covers eyes stays put  creases bit much products give less coverage 
2,i yet find concealer i happy  i really dark eye circles camouflage somewhat  i hoped  instead covering  seems change shade  kind like i painting rubbed white paint black spot  turning grey  get i mean  it looks really cakey  it could i really dry skin  even moisturizer  primer stop looking cakey i m returning money back  that s primarily i bought  i m going try eve pearl s salmon concealer shade  well shiseido s concealer  hopefully i ll find i like 
5,suffer severe skin discoloration cant tell good product hiding  for people issues relating skin  pls try far best concealers across    
1,the rating show delay  why taking long get seasons best tv shows time dvd  what  we go legal way seems pushed illegal means order obtain shows  i m sure i could get numerous vendors throughout thailand  it would surprise two seasons already available download internet  but us spend money legally  and thanks fox seems like may never able 
2,as someone bought first season the bob newhart show  i must say i disappointed poor quality  i mean series character pictures sided dvds set two sided  there still channels broadcasting series even though cut up syndicated version  better i bought  wait someone responsible like shout factory right try hulu  may 
2,first i say i disappointed i ended buying drama audio cd instead ost  while i love karin anime  spending money something i fully understand bit aggravating all aside  i m sure cd treat listen  it unfortunately means imagination overdrive time trying create semblance happening if devoted karin fan likes collecting japanese audio drama cds  you if re looking actual background music karin series  ll look elsewhere  you could start www play asia com  however  amazon com always updating changing  may able find re looking for enjoy

2,being fan isabelle huppert s work  i expected something film  the good thing film  matter fact  huppert s performance woman coming undone  she lives relatively closed  closely monitored live in mother  life piano teacher  everything seems stern  put together  except bizarre relationship mother  controls everything   and huppert s much younger student begins pursue  by time huppert succumbs  unraveling  at time  movie unravels 
1,i sold i saw many ratings proclaimed  star movie received disappointment  waste time money  if really see good movie piano pianist good story i recommend  the piano   this movie somewhat sickening pointless  there real good story behind movie  just  puzzling demented sicko s s purpose make vomit throw movie away  i d like give synopsis movie truth  s really good plot talk synopsis do favor skip movie  you ll save time money  not  star movies earned stars 
1,this movie crap  it boasts journey submission d s  it boring merely poorly filmed interpretation lustful quest dominantion 
1,i big fan foreign movies  when i read read reviews listed  i decided see movie buying dvd  thank goodness  the storyline terrible 
1,that movie soooo boring  an old teacher living together mum  hates  blunt loud dialogues  independent self supporting lady stay  ridiculous i  disappointed actress huppert s role  fault  little say  scene public toilet e  jelinek s story either transported really far away real life  sex  even perverse perversion  i even try find  much time spent already  sorry 
1,this number worst movie i ever seen  i usually love french films enjoy unprudish free attitude  went far  i wanted leave theatre  i transfixed horror move  i gagged  i winced  i covered eyes  still i could n t move  after torture finally i felt shellshocked needed go home watch the lion king recover  it glimpse world sad  demented  twisted character i need see  there point movie i felt existed purely shock value lesson  point true plot  if value time watch movie 
2,the acting good  the opinion i watching movie someone s spoof bdsm  the ending left mouth hanging open shaking head wonderment 
2,i disagree reviewers heaped praise many stars movie i found art house s least pleasing  you seen words like  dark  brooding  disturbing thrown around like confetti  truth movie simply deliver  what leaves sour taste mouth disturbed main character  semi graphic sexual scenes  mainly compelling film ends abruptly  predictably leaving viewer feeling cheated  is well made  yes  well acted  sure  like many  critically acclaimed  dramas s missing vital thing  most stories beginning  middle  leaves hanging nearly two hours  saying  what   
5,what brilliant movie incest leads devastation woman  a woman n t feel anything  trying desperately every way feel   something  and someone presents draw withered self  re enact adoloscent despair  come  folks  mother tells s filthy  berates giving  psychology  brilliantly acted compelling  of course  wants student damaged  jealous trying protect student overbearing parents  i doubt i m going sleep well tonight 
2,deadly accurate  especially mother stuff  incredible performances  i d rather curl watch roman holiday   life s short roll around john 
1,ok  so isabelle huppert brave things  so  the movie pretentious bore never grabs viewer  it s series nasty kinky scenes ultimately go nowhere  the isabelle huppert character psychopath  incredibly uninteresting one a truly disappointing movie 
3,i watched film feel i need shower  this emotionally drainiing film two sick twisted people  mother daughter  the mother like mama rose gypsy  totally focused daughter unwilling unable let go  the daughter damaged break away mother time sexually repressed turns porno relieve repression  but really n t release  at times i felt like strangling mother mother sick i felt ashamed i felt this film stick  whether like i m sure  i watched  means i n t hate i would walked away   isabelle huppert magnificent  always  plays repressed woman verge eruption  see la ceremonie  even feelings schubert twisted i still would say s worth rental  you forget movie  i promise 
5,bound become classic world cinema  the piano teacher   michael haneke s perfect film  it tells story women repressed abused mother explodes sexual tension it comes music  sort chaotic relationship students  times incestuous times perverse truly disturbed women rigid philosophy music must see  modern classic powerful new cinematic voice 
3,despite superb performance huppert movie whole simply n t hold water  her repression hands mother  another great performance  well done i n t buy tenor relationship young  genius   and ending rather strained copout  nevertheless  interesting movie excellent acting  unfortunately  interview isabelle throws absolutely light character  must brilliant instinctive actress 
4,got see film recently  i n t find near strong overall advertised being it twisted moments  elements going overall different i ve seen film past several years enjoyed music  overall chemistry 
2,i adored movie dispelled simulacra gracious living classical music  i hated movie shallow way demonized bdsm culture  much irreversible demonized gay men i suprised young carefree boy love would suddenly turn judgemental object affections  teacher less  provided instructions please  i difficulty making leap  i surprised pianist  tactile creature  would chose manual engagement arousal i thought scene huppert pulled little box personal delights beneath bed greatest amount compassion empathy film  it heartbreaking see small world truly

3,i bought book trip thailand next winter  i put practice yet however  thai tonal language  book indicate tones use pronouncing word 
2,although i avid anne rice fan  i initially bought book back cover proclaimed  modern story o   since story o favorite books genre erotica  i buy  seems sweeping claims hardly ever turn true    the book starts strong  intensely erotic scenes focusing lisa eliot beginnings interesting love story  book progresses characters seemed become less less realistic  time i finished  i felt extremely unsatisfied  if re anne rice fan  good book read  see fares genre horror  overall s much better erotica  book definitely live claim good story o 
3,i enjoyed setting details book  bdsm folks really enjoy beginning novel  it could easily made great book staying island  once characters leave new oleans  i felt book kind fell apart  the ending poor leaves wanting return island slaves  i d say buy book beginning parts n t expect yummy parts last throughout book  it loses momentum ends without sort bang  disappointing  i still recommend nevertheless 
4,i m huge anne rice fan  i bought add collection  she style  if fan  i would recommend adding 
3,exit to eden okay read  it dark strong tone  i must say kept wanting read first chapters    however  somewhere middle book lost  but  i figured i paid might well keep reading the book everyone like everything else life  personally i n t think better fifty shades grey  ca n t wait movie 
3,i got say i little bit dissapointed book  i really liked descriptions places colorful vivid seemed  the part made dissapointed left island  the woman basket case rude people little reason i n t see would ever truly tolerated  once left island resort went hill i found wishing rest book would go back i waiting moment never came  it good certainly great 
4,  besides  writing gorgeous  new orleans settings wonderful  ann rice truly writer many talents  many diverse interests kinky  yes  erotic  yes  fun  yes  should read  yes 
5,movie okay  i liked  never realized book  i buying anne rice s books saw exit eden  i picked knowing anne rice wrote  would good  but   even better  a must read  it completely different movie  but totally better  i recommend book problem  you must open minded  i like fact went the club real life  i read reviews  i agree people saying best  for say  trash   may need open eyes see true world  it s s anymore  you opinions  i excellent book to read  i read witching hour books follow series  anne rice continues amaze works  specially considering earlier written book  amazing  read 
4, close  i fortunate people able read book film came  i would like open stating liked  movie  starring rosie o donnell  do not read the book  likewise  read book  avoid movie like would avoid rabid showing signs ebola this rice s greatest erotic work  it lacks expansiveness beauty trilogy vividness belinda  those facts aside  interesting work psychological standpoint  understanding  top    bottom    master mistress    slave  relationships   bad read sexual content scenes  however  pathetic  vaguely slapstick comedy film made  nowhere near quality work 
5,a friend recommended book  once i started  i could n t put  captured many ideas i d already thinking  i gave wife   surprise  loved  needless say  completely changed lives better 
5,i able put book  if ever interested s m  must read  anne takes point sexually submissive like ever 
3,i need say book started quite  like  full exciting sexual happenings    ended really good happily ever  story  theres nothing wrong  mind loved romantic side story  beautiful  but would seem first chapters  whole  master slave aspects totally lost gone  and ve read beauty series  anne rice probably picked book  well hoping something satisfying beauty series ve chosen wrong book  if reading love stories love see happy endings people run away fall love  luck 
4,i read much anne rice  finally managed read books  since i dislike anything vampires thought i would give try  all i say  club   i meet like elliott   wow  this sensual two people lisa elliott enjoyed hilt heavy dose alternative  life style couple finally meet  passion   much powerful intense ever experienced  they find willing risk anything persue opportunity  love   rice actually allows see fall love flight club  this strong powerful book i found page turner 
2,this n t i expected  once i done i understand anne trying reading book i wondering doing it s bad book  i expected she spends lots time spouting people become masochists  to honest i wanted went club  
3,the concept story   s m club med  interesting  n t seem taken s full potential  a good story relationship two main characters gets mired knowing erotic novel harlequin romance  her sexual writing vanilla writings  beauty series  etc   never gets heavily involved sex scenes  the lack attention sexual parts confusion meant keeps higher rating  it good read however  n t expect much good  human  story
4,a love story infinitely readable sleeping beauty set  delves deep human psyche  attempts explain someone would choose bsdm lifestyle  plenty erotica  plot  a great read 
3,this times i say  movie better book  i say two reasons  the first personal dislike fiction protrays rape precusor loving relationship rapes book  the second i m educator works university student organization promote explain bdsm viable form sexuality  while i d happily recommend seeing movie version  i d hestitant say newbie  watch  fear might think book reflecting actual bdsm relationship  a complaint i ve heard book true  the main characters say give sm  instead greatly downplayed leading common assumption sm seen inferior vanilla 
3,i n t really say i liked  but honestly  i expected  i bought i like anne rice  i m really subject matter  i think went tangent  but like sort thing  like book  the middle last part book much interesting club scene detailed part  all  s  m book might interest  if  might skip 
2,i kept thinking elliot lisa would really get dirty  club   was i disappointed actually sex  new orleans boot    i say time sex worth price book  but rest poorly written 
2,the book hold interest well  it long tedious  i could n t wait  the characters believable erotic  they came across quite clown ish  anne rice excellent writer  novel would never believe 
2,i say worst novels ever written  i n t think entertaining  after finishing book  i went rented movie  it far better novel  i sorry anne rice  i see used pseudo wrote book  it stinks 
1,this book n t i expected  never read anne rice  reading others written  thought i d buy book hers should saved money  story far fetched  did n t finish 
4,i like book lot ann rice s books  it full sadism  homosexuality  it interesting story  holds attention 
3,i bought book seeing movie  boy i disappointed  thisth book anne rice i read  since gone read   after  books i finally given anne ability write ending 
2,i bought book i thought would similar  sleeping beauty  series  it n t even close  this romance novel bdsm  even romance little cheesy if romance novel  go ahead get book  if looking good bdsm  look elsewhere 
3,i bought book anne rice wrote compared shades gray  it sounded like full sexual scenes reality n t many  so little disapointing  then quite boy boy mentionings turned little well  in addition i thought would go deep detail s  m   scenes kinda thing  i say detail book adequate  she explained every detail make feel really  also underlying love story kinda sweet twisted way   all good book   waste time   different i m used reading 
2,it s erotic engrossing i thought would  there parts begins get really sensual  ends rather abruptly n t continue long enough things develop  try sleeping beauty novels 
1,this worst trash i ever misfortune listen  the language overwrought  plot far fetched shallow  even readers sounded embarrassed involved project  however  make laugh loud quite often  maybe book better  for good s  m story  try alasdair gray s  something leather  
2,perhaps s time book cutting edge  us within lifestyle  s tame contrived unsatisfying degree  it s ironic film adaptation watered even  turned worst movies re likely see  ann rice n t deserve treatment there books capture true essence bdsm fanatsy much engrossing  interestingly enough  ms rice written well   writing a n roquelaure  see trilogy sleeping beauty series 
3,when i bought exit eden  i expecting rather graphic  intense novel along lines beauty trilogy  what i got whirlwind romance bracketed the club  the club much akin beauty trilogy  however  the club played  drops almost completely sight  if enjoy romance novels  minus kinkiness anne rice reputation  might right alley  it s got dash kink  predominantly s two lovers  as beauty books  gets bit repetetive  unlike vampire chronicles  seemed soon  time i made exit eden  i good ready get 
3,this least favorite rice s works  it begins boldly  over the top sexual adventure fringes   ends unlikely boringly banal marriage it rice attack conscience  publisher   half way  so book ends neither satisfying piece erotica romance  neither fish fowl   i preferred beauty books somewhat unique brand b  erotica  literary side  best vampire chronicles  mayfair witch books  little known cry heaven  feast all saints this neither good typical rice 
5,i n t believe i read book sitting  this first novel anne rice i ve ever read  her words descriptive  i found painting images mind  even body shivered i read encounters elliott lisa  it s good story  i n t really get s  m stuff  still good book  most memorable section   butter cinnamon new orleans 
5,i think enough tell game great  this game resembles mario6 banjo kazooie  better graphics mature gameplay would expect xbox  the graphics amazing  controls easy use  the characters game amazing  unique traits  there several levels game takes places far wide  from snowy winter wonderlad firery desert  get feeling visiting places around world move joystick  with resemblance old happy mario6 banjo kazooie  must buy game 
5,i get lot compliments necklace i wear  the chain heavy enough sturdy  bulky  the amethysts deep color good clarity  recommended 
2,i ve tried  zoe bars   are more    my personal favorite chocolate peanut butter  i ve purchased  boxes last months flavor love meal snack  they thing i ve found replace sweets guilt eating but   the chocolate ones good tasting good texture  too dense  strange  odd chocolate similarity really chocolate bad aftertaste  even worse  however  peanut butter ones  i gave away  at least i ll likely eat eventually 
2,the first thing i noticed dense  waxy dry gritty texture  and really slight chocolate flavor  strange aftertaste  they filling though  eating compressed cardboard 
4,well built   recommend  people install   bought chevy silverado   frame cut different towing hitch modify   took  hours install alone  
2,let start saying i never put book  even i n t like  this i could n t even get past first pages  maybe i n t give chance  foul language vile event depicted first pages turned completely book  i m glad free download kindle  i gave two stars i n t give chance get better  if i n t deleted  maybe i would give another chance  i certainly n t pay 
4,my brother lives bangkok i ve many times i keen see novel set would like i n t disappointed  mr moore evokes seediness poverty without appearing soul destroyingly hopeless manages balance interesting characters  good  bad humanly flawed   good mystery moments beauty humour  i enjoyed intend try next  
2,i almost gave reading book couple chapters reasons star reviewers  i n t say i writing style  it reminds  guy noir  skit  a prairie home companion    course  supposed funny take off kinds books  the protagonist seemed stereotypical formula rather real person  i struggled chapter   then i began get invested story  i think writing began improve bit characters gained dimension  still  ends  stars  perhaps later books better 
1,i read first two chapters book  i say writing horrible  i n t believe i wasted time reading much book 
2,sorry  i could n t get  if read good thrillers located bangkok  try john burdett s books beginning bangkok   
1, herland  hardly cracking read  s interesting feminist historical text  it s worth reading  love mike get different edition  this cover utterly hideous completely odds ethos story  why would female only society  dress utilitarian reproduction asexual  tart pink eyeshadow mascara would make even overly flamboyant drag queen quail 
1,herland  charlotte perkins gilman  tries view world without  the notion world would peaceful little place without absurd  women well  competed centuries  it ridiculous assert women would fight amongst  if possible give book zero stars  i would 
3,read novelty  well written good story  in fact  over written strange  as period piece primary source  works well  stay away re looking something enjoy 
3,this book much story essay ideals  the actual storyline little book trying accomplish obvious  truthfully  i found many points valid way expressed made dislike book  this story trapped female society makes seem though women better  could authors opinion   however many ideals learned reading book  i recommend book looking story wish ideas socitey 
3,this book interesting  say least  while i n t particularly connect characters  i n t think gilman s point readers fall love characters  message deeper characters story  it definitely gave lot think  main thing society   n t see lens gender way  as i n t imagine thing  women always compared real life  interesting concept spend time thinking  what would like people people gender completely irrelevant  if know whether i would recommend reading herland  answer yes i would interested classic feminist literature  it definitely valuable read i need acknowledge book may everyone  if interested stuff   definitely pick 
2,i know  herland  receives quite bit praise highly regarded  in opinion  work n t bear accolades  the story right boring  disappointing considering engaging gilman s short stories works  the plot odd message gilman trying convey lost  i saw another reviewer call work satire  i would strongly disagree  gilman intend  herland  satire  she attempting show women adept  social housekeeping  were unless read  many better gilman pieces absorb attention 
5,i read book many years ago wanted read again my order handled quickly professionally great service  great book 
2,this book hard understand sentences n t make sense  some make sense  ray bradbury better  i ve forced read bookth grade english teacher made us  when i start reading book okey  when i m page sentence n t make sense  it mostly say  i burn bookee   i would rather read great expectations instead  if good reader may try 
2,if wish read orwellian  dystopian novel set future  read novels george orwell  animal farm  undoubtedly  fahrenheit classic i guess required reading  completenes  certainly failed hold interest  i found writing little fluffy i find enjoyable plot remarkably thin  unlike richly constructed taut animal farm  i m afraid i n t call bradbury fan yet 
2,fahrenheit starts well  definately doesnt way  besides fact characters seem unreal impossible relate  point book montag friend incredibly insightful talk idiotic plan  n t go much  boring close impossible get  read  prepared 
2,basically  fahrenheit let  the drop ending cuts futuristic plot s potential  there much colorful vocabulary  metaphors elaborate sudden hardly knows whether something actually happening s figment character s imagination  it confusing challenging read  the main character  montag  fairly interesting conflict  the problem resolved enough book leave reader satisfied  plus  meaning book given away early  leaving nothing motivate reader  i recommend book nobody  disappointed 
4,i think fahrenheit great book  the story based good topic  one thing i liked book well written  this book never got boring lame  always fun keep reading  people like n t like read skim pay attention  book i intrested i never wanted put stop  one thing n t like book parts hard understand  it took pages fully understand i reading  i think teachers recomend book students 
3,it s bad book  but fahrenheit hardly representative best sci fi genre offer  s shame s endless place students  summer reading lists  n t challenged  for reason fahrenheit  martian chronicles seem decided representatives science fiction according average english teacher   s students disservice  so  read enjoy book  find bit dry s first forray sf  means keep exploring  there so many better books  
3,bought sons college english class  i read book years ago  and i saw movie  book follows movie somewhat  movies 
2,this book could easily summed pages  not i n t love attention detail stories  i  f dragged  it great concept good plot certain scenes bradbury overevaluated overexplained everything  i m never touching book 
5,come  classic  montag iconic impervious criticism  c mon  hates burning books s fireman   bradbury created best stories near future  tragically  beginning mirror  how many young people i hear say i n t like read  thing   are far away fahrenheit  five stars 
1,book good theme dragged  like book  montag stupid revolt first place knows law knows happen  why clarisse point day mildred said dead montag like oh ok lame boring  recomend book 
1,i thought worst book i ever read  there point way confusing  would ramble stuff even importnat plot  hated reading  stay away book 
1,fahrenheit lists top  worst books ever  english class read  didnt even read lastsection  time first test rolled around  hadnt even read pages  evenually forced read stopped got last section cause thought read anymore  might  felt connection characters  emotion towards  everything drawed way much  could easly say something couple pages  takes like tell little minor thing  for  really boring stupid  for  many ur like  maybe  cant attempt read  note  said attempt 
1,i read i high school  so children  now grandchildren read  none us able discover why  of superb books i read life  one ever selected required summer reading 
1,this book makes absolutely sense  i read first page i n t like  i read school i fallen asleep  times reading  all friends hate  we testnd dayth grade  even using cliffs notes n t help  i n t recommend book anyone 
1,if  i imediatly torch books bits pieces  the book proves point  burning books society much better farenheit published
1,this book hard read i n t find interesting  it really strange  i required read english class  i would n t recommend anyone i personally enjoy  i confused went entire way 
4,i give fahrenheit  stars keeps reader edge  i hard time putting book  fahrenheit lot like socity today  instead putting fires firemen started  that strange twist i liked book  i deducted half star little hard follow 
4,i gave fahrenheit  stars interesting thoughtful book  it shows books advent major ideas without books creativity thought would stifled  ray bradbury s classis story sure bet good reading i deducted star book sometimes hard follow don t let deter reading 
3,this book ended abruptly  way i n t expect  i would n t recommend someone n t appreciate science fiction books  someone n t pick weird storylines well  otherwise  s good book 
3,the story line plot book excellent  bradbury excellent job setting scence  however  hsi writing left somewhat confused uninterested times  the ending n t great either   i really liked much better 
3,story guy montag   fireman  repressive society  repents job burning books joins underground society committed memorizing great works literature  bradbury s excessively florid  overwrought prose bothered greatly  the futuristic society book burners never really seemed fully realized plausible  dealt questions book burning censorship intelligently  still seemed bit nave  bradbury struggles long form fiction  never felt execution rose level thematic ambition 
5,i m sophomore high school  i finished reading f451  i may slightly bias  since i love read  particularly sci fi  star trek rules    book really good  i know many read book junior high years  i think s better s read little later   digested  thoroughly mature audience  so many people  regardless high school levels  hate read  i sincerely believe dangerous things today s society  schools stress music  art  literature nearly much  we learn think  gain wisdom read  playing sports playing games computers  even many colleges give sports scholarships academic scholarships  western civilization better watch  ray bradbury s sci fi book become reality  
4,hello people  i thought fahrenheit good book  i would n t say best book world definetly good book read  it n t average book re used  s little diffrent  bradbury writes really well follow story  sometimes would say something would clue s talking  so go back read couple pages figure whats going  but i would say good book even though s little diffrent  s good give diffrent things try    peace out enjoy book         
2,fahrenheit disappointing book reader avid science fiction lover  this book difficult read  the correctors sometimes confusing understand  the setting hard visual picture  although plot good way described hard understand  i think science fiction lover would like book  but sometimes like read science fiction like huge science fiction lover like  i think needth grade advanced reader 
3,this true classic people required read school  i never  i regret  having read  i see benefit reading school would  books read school discussed examined detail  this book would lend well type depth analysis i glad i least read book  although i found okay  i think school setting i would enjoyed much  i n t find captivating emotional books i ve read ith anniversary edition  contains interview ray bradburyth anniversary  feels success book  it quite insightful interesting read 
4,irony without imagination think yourself you re mindless zombie  puppet people control  inmy opinion  s ray bradbury saying book   j litton  bdhs
4,ray bradbury takes us future government burns books keep people thinking and or rebelling  i think circumstances could somewhat true future world  dictators burned books throughout history keep people tame ideas  we step back say   hey  really give government much power  i mean  happened power people
4,i bought book ray bradbury died obituaries said best work  i know expect the book future  almost  everyone live vicariously lives others delivered via technology  the system prohibits independent thinking feeling actually used fire department burn anyone problem as i see people  included  using cell phones  social media  on line entertainment  i see society moving direction  it amazing bradbury created dystopian vision many years advance current technology almost makes possible today 
4,amazingly relevant times  story little odd wordy  excellently crafted piece go history classic 
3,i thought book ok  the book firefighter make decision could possibly change life  the firemen burn books illegal read  it s interesting future books would actually banned reading 
4,another book i read young dismissed  the book spot  the difference people tend obsessed pdas walls homes 
3,i assigned read school  i wanted know big choice school districts  i m glad i read  where i n t impressed bradbury s simplistic style  content gave lot think 
5,this book short  deep  it amazingly deep fact  length  bradbury captures something nature believe something passionately  ignorantly become sheepish  there lying  betrayal  small glimmers home  macabre future  one favorites far 
4,good book  part called  coca  best  cencorship  book kind like  giver  lot better 
4,i personally thought originality plot made book interesting  never i read book banning books using  firemen  get rid  at times lulls confusing parts  overall bradbury s unique style made book worthwhile read  i believe montag times flat character could use little spice  growth throughout novel seemed counteract deterioration within surrounding society  to think day society could like montag s  burning books stifling creativity  absolutely frightening book try supress notion  it actually amplifies  used reference future generations would never reach low point montag s society reached 
3,at first book confusing lame  gets better towards middle  the idea little stretched  i think book ended without last couple chapters i got sick reading  the author seems little messed 
4,this book exceptional portrayal future  yet  slow chapters  if buy book  brunt hardship  gets incredible later 
5,this book sweeps world called happiness i think book warning us dangers technology i love way portrays life future liberal lazy people become i especially love captain beatty s personality  burn books yet knows quite alot them captain beatty s kind ironic incorporates word beatific  means show extreme joy bliss  book trying stay happy really re not they happy opinion always something n t think conversation human being this book interesting i recomend teens learn life 
4,i first introduced ray bradbury i took the martian chronicles community library  i impressed  now  several years later  i finally read fahrenheit the book divided three parts  first two absolutely excellent   the afterword coda  well   the third part story  however  lost  ray bradbury decided  partway section  abandon easily flowing narrative established rest book  instead picked difficult follow inner dialogue lost interest  which made even harder follow rest book but  bradbury deserves gold star insight society working today  foresaw several years ago   we giving books stopping thinking  remember  first  government n t burn books   people stopped reading them love hate  book rings truth  and  whatever  n t burn 
5,for grade levelsth  fahrenheit sure please readers intrests  fireman guy montag deeply troubled meets local girl watchs women burn home  he realizes importance books keeps burning within days  totally diffrent person author ray bradbury predicts future successfuly holds reader s intrest  frightingly  ray predictions quite acurate  read see 
4,a nice easy read someone may interested futuristic fun read  guy montag brings reader whole new life style ever experienced  i enjoyed reading book never moment i felt bored i reading thought putting  i recommend book young adult looking relaxing  fun read 
4,a great read thought provoking  we read part community grant  the big read  would strongly recommend 
3,bradbury s  fahrenheit  pretty depressing book read  oh  really happens book  bowl cherries   close society describes  we ve pretty much reached big media pervasive television do n t read point describes precursor universe  the thing left actual banning books  though horrible us  bradbury writes pretty good story around  the problem i book bradbury jumps  tell a story  rails quite bit ends  classic citations  philosophy tracks often long  it gets way s saying  of course  saying slippery slopes describes  condense books removing thought producing parts  leading world  but  even   interruptions  story  i rate book merely ok  stars   
4,in ray bradbury s science fiction story fahrenheit  tells world set future s illegal books  the main character  guy montag  works fire department setting fires homes occupied literature  guy montag  unhappy home  surrounded technology feels unimportant  guy montag soon realizes burning books would ruin years writing history  takes home handful books put danger  the setting believable  unknown  familiar time  it lot similar issues today s world  futuristic spin  fahrenheit fast paced  fascinating read  i would recommend anybody likes sci fi thrillers 
4,although profound george orwell s      fahrenheit  still stands prophetic warning evils censorship  controlling masses ignorance the little lost profundity comparison    made readability  whereas    took two days complete  i read  fahrenheit  afternoon  additionally    ends feeling hopelessness  whereas ends degree optimism future overall  still stands limited number dystopian stories whose message remains vital today published 
3,fahrenheit intresting mind boggling book  it made realize important books society  much books really influence reality  in f451 government afraid let people ideas  they wanted community think wanted think  the people caught material items  even forgot thinking humans real human beings  most people particular community  talk  another  would rather front t vs  after community n t even people anymore  robots  they government wanted  wanted  they lost sense individuality idealism  this novel made value books  made realize imperfect world would like    p    
1,fahrenheit worst book i ever read whole life  i forced read school  i disguised book starting first page  there absolutely nothing good book  it makes sense  i personally n t think world become  predicted book  i find book offensive religious beliefs  how book takes lord vain  almost every page  used class novel  everyone knows taking lord s vain breaking god s commandments   i never read book bad fahrenheit language  i n t understand school boards justify book  use classes  anyone n t read book  n t waste time 
1,confusing  disturbing  stupid words use describing book  firemen start fires   come  burning every book exists  n t look future  it s look bradbury s twisted little mind  bottom line    do n t waste time 
2,haing missed book school  somehow  i ve always meant read since i keep hearing great things  i n t know expectations high i m missing something everyone else sees  i n t like it the idea political correctness grows something ridiculous books burned  houses occupy burned impossible swallow  add single character likeable  killed pretty early   pretty boring story go along  reason i able finish short i n t see reason anyone would read book  i m clearly minority  maybe ll like better i 
1,i marked star i give anything lower  i placed order jan  time get order came went  here feb   i still cd fahrenheit  is company located moon  why taking so long order get  i most displeased  i never order anything company cheapbks4u  this service atrocious

5,this book breathtaking  jawdropping  eyeopening phenomenon  i read book several times every time i see something i n t see gain level battle ignorance 
4,bradbury creates perfect dystopia life know exist  the deep value somewhat simple style makes book finest ever written  this book necessity anyone plans helping preserve liberty s self 
4,it s book basically tells censorship  it well written makes think censorship today

4,the story simple  powerful  as reviewers noted  details bradbury imagined  wrote  publication date  true  large tvs walls  move towards simplistic sensationalism  deep distrust education educated people  etc   i found writing serviceable  sometimes brilliant  occasionally metaphors get long winded overly descriptive theth anniversary edition  published ballantine books del rey wonderful  not get full unedited text  ironically  book censorship censored frequently years   get afterword coda  added lates  earlys  illuminating page interview bradbury  in interview describes writing process  thinks book holds today  whether d write sequel  it s great addition book 
4,fahrenheit  the temperature books catch fire burn odd title  odd story  the community story takes place seems strange  s shockingly similar  both community  citizens follow government says without question  in case  people n t read books  if  firemen burn  it s simple  ray bradbury s account  becomes complex guy montag  main character fireman  discovers process wrong  firemen destroy homes books  people aloud read  but  find reading ray bradbury s fahrenheit 
1,this book raved classic sf story many years  i decided worth reading  how wrong i  as many called  brilliant classics  author gets novel idea tries run  unfortunately  story fizzles completely towards full impact original message  i disappointed book wonder people rate books like highly  do n t bother reading 
3,basically  montag  firefighter  future   burns houses books inside  in  future   books banned  bradbury tries describe world  future  big screen  color tvs  too bad  bradbury  world already here it mostly boring read  except moments  you could describe book depressing  everyone  even montag  seems unhappy  i really n t bradbury think depressing world becoming 
1,after reading school project i would avise anyone reading reviews stay clear unless eighty waste last months life  pointless  school teachers little old scotland make read  if burn books i put get burned straight away 
1,last year read class  there two books teacher made us read i hate passion  i could stand way bradbury writes authors would say pit pat rain would say pit pat pit pat pit pat half page royally annoying far guy said individuality conformity read read ayn rand s anthem  it much better  deserves status classic unlike 
4,this book although worst distopian books good childs view  some characters showed extreme likeness modern society theme well developed  many good literature components work 
2,i order book week shipped took long get i download book daughters kindle night needed school  that cost    got bookthth february  wo n t use 
3,the fun little futuristic book society fear someone may learn something different government s message reading  it tells story two lonely people caught lifes learn whole new world reading the premise story firefighter burn building people n t follow government ironic  the story interesting tender parts the problem book usual ending types books two characters escaping rest world  well know read 
3,i know s criminal like classic book   but different strokes right  the concept communistic approach  amazing concept  i found tough read  slow  tough get  ground breaking  profound  i pretty disappointed book  found litte boring  s pointed n t  i prefer animal farm book 
2,personally  i found background idea book smart  appetizing   world books forbidden fire eaters actually fire blowers fighting mind globalization dangers reading building way think life  unfortunately i reckon style weak  words thrown without explanesions pages  sentences chopped way often made feel totally extraneous plot  a heavy atmosphere floats book i fight hard keep reading  in simple words  i d mark   subjects   style 
2,i always preferred hear author read works really know intended   mr bradbury tone tone carried mush mouth  it s horrendous painful listen  go find another copy  trust  i would quit i m trying finish book club   mercifully   cds s pretty short amendment  so finishing  i must say last cd interview author s really interesting  if d like hear talk life  books genesis  etc  skip last cd  i enjoy s almost like different person speaking  he s much gregarious talking 
2,i finally got around classic young adult novel  i figured since i m young adult literature class mlis  i might well catch  i never read book i dryly bored ray bradbury s work  i n t seem feel passion science fiction not fahrenheit scifi  there strong presence metaphor book  heavy presence reading delight  though idea cute  firemen ignites fires destroy knowledge aka power  arson s twist  but conclusion obvious start i thought  read s  written cold war fear  i see appeal plot  but i wish bradbury either revved scifi gave apocalypse gave robotic dogs let political hounds communist hunting 
3,the author starts interesting approach problem censorship  eventually falls flat  what would made nice magazine sized story  n t ability fill novel  the book mercifully short  story times dull pointless full dull pointless characters  the character interest killed couple pages  its entirely fair comparison  brave new world orders magnitude better  the ending completely unsatisfying author s vision future  hopes fears  ring true  overall interesting read concept involved  keep expectations low 
2,i always liked book read i thought i would get cd  ray bradbury reads  bad  it painful listen voice i turn  he reads monotone voice put sleep  someone needs re make cd s 
3,this bradbury s best work  his forte science fiction short story  his novel ponderous slow moving  turn young people sci fi attract  one wonders many high schools use required reading sci fi much truly exciting attractive young people equal better particular piece literary sense  david weber  jack campbell  robert jordan host others quickly mind  even asimov  dated though  would preferable introduction young adults sci fi reading offers rich literary content 
3,it s disturbingly prophetic reading radical idea day age  but concept old day s regular affair  it s simply longer system shock  i personally find characterization bit thin  arguably point sterile society  it s classic good reason  i n t know i find read entertaining days 
5,i bought book personal library thrilled s condition  it condition seller great work  the book delivered really quickly i thoroughly enjoyed reading  thanks 
1,this definitely worst books i ever across  in modern version  forword introduction  both nothing story  ray bradbury babbles past came ideas books no one cares about  i almost fell asleep forword  i dont know i survived book  the book drags painfully slow pace  as ray bradbury  states introduction eyes  hitler burning brutally killing people level burning book  i think statement pretty much self explanatory views humanity  great guy  eh 
1,this book quite possibly worst piece science fiction i read   it dramatically boring far contrived interesting   the world bradbury creates thoroughly dry i simply hated look future   nothing interesting thought provoking  except books examination issues censorship whole  i like fantastically created worlds futures  re dry brittle like  simply long pages book burn bitterly   
1,to put simply  book sucked  although juvenile way putting  fits perfectly  this book boring  description bradbury puts could n t possibly describe slowly moves  if bradbury wanted us realize importance books  least could make book semi interesting  essentially  do n t waste time 
1,i read book school  i  personally  n t type science fiction  could play part rating  confusing worth time  the book guy montag fireman three four hundred years future firemen cause fires instead putting  the book mentions people montag meets friends failing relationship wife  there many futuristic  objects book keeps thinking confused  the book ends chase far best part  if n t enjoy science fiction  i recommend book  i read required 
2,i found book dry boring  i tried compare the giver  i conuld n t  i know good points  enought read again ps if n t agree  please n t click  no  button 
1,i really like book  now  n t get wrong idea good  writing horrible  i normally like ray bradbury s work   the writing style repetitive boring  i think books could great written differently 
1,ever wrote dumb confusing book mental state mind  fahrenheit overworded description fireman lives rebellion  it bad influence young people world  this book should be burned 
4,is book outdated  have people finally learned closing minds  unfortunately people still need message fahrenheit  most people still convinced god becomes angry  worse  far worse  still burning books today ignore new ideas 
5,grateful i stumbled upon book  a fantastic read  timeless incredibly thought provoking if summary grabs  give chance 
5,this amazing novel  everybody read message  while books become outdated  novel still relevant today 
4,while sometimes hard follow  ray bradbury s science fiction classic still intense searing best bears many frightening resemblences world  this futuristic civilization regards cursory items magazines better books  television pretty much taken  s even mention kids frequently killing  pretty amazing stuff  considering bradbury wrote way back  at least n t gone far burn books  knows  maybe things get bad might   calling all guy montags 
5,to reviewers read book school hated  i forced read ith grade  felt way  i thought dumbest boring book i d ever read i m telling  wait   years  pick book  i promise enjoy  it s story oppressed society courage try break free  please  give farenheit another chance  you n t regret 
3,i purchased kindle version classic today  i paid    on  fourth  page  error clarisse s statement   but  re     the truncated next paragraph attached  reads   but  re  allon soon    i certainly hope rest text n t riddled sloppy proofing  this n t free e book  even deeply discounted ebook  it s classic priced    i expect better  amazon i bought book today  june   morning s news ray bradbury s passing  i thought  clever  book demise books kindle  ironic  kindle version starts sloppy mistake  ironic  sorely disappointing 
4,i enjoyed reading book  everyone enjoy first reading  it may slighlty difficult beginning continue read find book deep  compelling  i feel read  enjoy absorb information may missed first reading  go montag 
3,this book neither good  bad  i admit  difficult read   slow paced   story frightening realism  it depicts society books burned knowledge  essence  controlled government control  the premise interesting  paistagging detail everything described left fairly bored  it nice   stick bordom 
3,this books interesting  it s named montag fireman instead putting fire  starts burning books finds people s houses  in opinion i think book reality  even though burning books lot people losing interest reading  peolpe would rather watch t v  play nintendo  get computer everything going book  so probably like read book you understand importance books appreciate 
3,i thought book pretty overrated  admittedly  concept interesting story rolls around right  superfluous metaphor laden rambling passages really irked  i much i think i would liked book i n t keep picturing bradbury sitting somewhere painfully smug look  but  fahrenheit worth reading  though necessarily s cracked 
3,fahrenheit  science fiction book written ray bradbury  good read  in book  guy montag  fireman  paid burn books  in fact  fireman paid burn books  this book  science fiction  takes place future  guy enjoys job  he gets paid well understands system  books burning  he impression books full nothing garbage  he meets girl named clarisse changes views completely  he starts become interested books  he hides books house  he suddenly realizes  this book somewhat difficult read  it may enjoyed children sixth grade  the sentences somewhat long complex  at times  vocabulary difficult  i would rate book fair  i would recommend people heavily interested science fiction 
4,i always like read classic every  whether mystery  literature  good old science fiction  it seems many classic science fiction novels deal s attitude toward surroundings rather stories aliens future world gone crazy thru technology  this book takes simple premise world books illegal turns twilight zone episode  the best part novel reader forced contemplate scenario actually imaginable decide would act react  an interesting story say least    
4,this book follows outline great novel    george orwell  this book deals mainly threat censorship poses nation  guy montag  fireman  never problem going along norm meets young girl changes perspective life  he begins question burns books leads trouble boss fire chief beatty  there many important lessons draw book mainly idea books never live people s hearts minds long lessons remembered  this book teach young people appreciate importance books  must read 
3,fahrenheit realistic makes wonder world turn like  ray bradbury great author  his description good  fahrenheit almost little advanced  it hard imagine world ever getting way  i personally prefer books could actually happen seems unreal but keep wondering happen  many youth seemed like book i think interesting 
3,this  classic  left feeling though written talentedth grader  the basic premise interesting  somewhat borrowed huxley s brave new world  virtue sophomoric storytelling  overly unrealistic flowery dialogue huge leaps logic writer n t effective suspending disbelief 
5,ray bradbury s fahrenheit book make think  as reading book  questions pop would probably never thought  set distant future  bradbury plunges life guy montag  he fireman always taught ask   his job burn  put flames  never asking reasons behind burnings  he goes life happy  knowing anything wrong  he lives unperfected utopia  due event  whole mentality crumbles chaos emerges goes transformation  making everyone around enemy  except people gone metamorphosis  no longer ignorant becomes isolated  pushing way out this book probably best books i ever read  might even favorite  if like books the giver  short story harrison bergeron  definitely book read 
3,i love books like i express  utopian society type books probably favorite things read  so  naturally  i picked fahrenheit  i heard great things everyone except good friend said simply although n t means despise  thought tad corny  i began reading book immediately fell love style writing  but  i read  i found book felt little    i think may little unbelievable really  especially mechanical hounds  i disappointed clarisse  although i n t go detail  the thing i really liked though  bradbury hit nail head comes development political correctness  overall  book alright  it quick read i still certainly glad i read 
3,well  s bad book  actually considered book though   rather  short story  the ideas expressed valable n t much story science behind laughable  bradbury makes good points argues well  s re reading book  book matter  probably implies already like reading value books pretty high  so bradbury preaching converted  this book makes great reading list though  many names dropped books quoted  instead reading book read books mentioned  or reminder love read much 
5,i love writings ray bradbury book tops all although decades old  s message loud clear  and i still think allegories themes still prevelant today s society 
3,an average book  canonized classic  important  message  it s favorite middle high school english classes theme dovetails nicely lesson teachers country try teach students   reading good   also  expertly exploits teachers  worst fear  reading become irrelevant activity tv permanently place  as far quality concerned  unfortunately  bradbury s novel simply n t good enough merit overblown reputation  do n t believe hype 
5,this book really good made think lot society censorship  we already point everything think already thought us  news  magazines  media  etc   i guess long happy society always ruled brainwashed government  anyways   read book ll make think real life lucky society n t screwed could 
4,many people already read reviewed novel  i willjust say worth  rating 
2,i picked book high expectations ray bradbury relavtively famous  book fantastically reknowned  censorship  issue i really about well  my expectations smothered  stabbed repeatedly  left floor  this good book  bradbury s writing incredibly confusing  pivotal parts story removed main plot n t understand them bradbury penchant killing characters  for example  character  changes life main character  dead pages book  if burned cause books  fine  got run car  how stupid  pass  real futuristic utopia  try  just 
2,while i appreciate bradbury s views television s effects people  i believe gave far much credence communistic approach controlling people away books  considering beautiful complexity book like dandelion wine  disappointingly simplistic unrealistic  and bomb   stepped totally reality  since time written  world would known effects radiation went far beyond initial destruction  and gave explanation  bradbury ignored issues detriment entire concept 
3,i bought needed english prep class  i hope enjoyed 
3,this book classic predicts many products use today flat screen tv wall  blue tooth  drones 
3,fahrenheit cautionary set world books banned  named temperature paper catches fire burns  book tells story extraordinary week life guy montag   fireman  whose job burn houses harbouring books  until day begins think job worthwhile society would make think  this single act questioning leads chain events  by book s  world montag knew never again part fable  part thriller  fahrenheit fascinating provocative read 
4,my daughter readth grade english class i decided check  it well written compelling still good read  the author makes number excellent points  to felt like film noir mixed comic book qualities imagination  still  good read lessons share 
4,this books see pieces kinds books movies 
4,i really enjoyed book  story line little different i expected  this always fun book read  i reading future well 
3,this book community banned outlawed viewing reading books  the community firemen burn books  guy montag firemen described book  problems develop wife  mildred  bradbury describes life boring dull  guy montag family allowed watch television  montag s neighbor  young girl named clarisse  excited ideas reading books  he decides hide stash books home i found book really strange  it ironic see bradbury basically able predict world society  it interesting see book developed 
5,farenheight extrordinary piece literature  it contains number symbols  ray bradbury written deep complex piece literaature farenheight  it set place future  everything isin fast pace  second breathe world takes place  you walk along road  also talk  the odd things book firemen start fires  illegal books  after reading book i left wonder   future really like 
4,i liked symbolism ray bradbury used book  i really liked mildred  mechanical   i really enjoyed reading book i m glad i read class teacher could explain symbolism metaphors  other really liked book shoutz   holy angels 
3,fahrenheit strange different book  i got meaning  hard understand  the book world future  the people future believe education waste time  they burn books addicted t v  one  guy montag  starts see things differently  he n t like life people  he breaks free world knows goes rough adventure escape s always known  i would say book meant people range teen adult enjoy reading sci fi novels 
5,a great story pass time travel  plane car   and a half hours read  it starts guy montag  fireman whose job actually start fires  primarily burn books owner s houses  after encountered strange year old girl asks    things     witnessing woman commit suicide lighting house  bearing books  fire rather let firemen  decides must something else books words paper  the story struggles revive book world save certain destruction 
5,ray bradbury classical novel fahrenheit uses symbolism  imagery  literary devises create abhorrent world filled censorship  in fahrenheit  ray bradbury gives frightening vision future firemen n t put fires  start order burn books  bradbury paints society holding happiness highest goal  trivial  useless information good ideas knowledge bad  one reoccurring literary devises novel symbolism  we often see symbolism character s names  for example  main characters  guy montag two translations  guy signifies guy faux famous associate effigy  mischief day  nov    montag trademark need american paper company  brand furnaces  more symbolism shown meet faber  faber america s leading pencil company going pencil writes montag s paper 
5,i thought book great really makes wonder  this book written person great imagination  best  and like einstein said   imagination important knowledge   which i thought book  i would reccomend book anyone wants read page makes read next 
3,this book discriptive sceens others barly anything  the author never said anywhere time date  it really hard understand  sometimes i know going  n t stay place long catch 
3,this short review audio book great classic read author  the rendition terrible  it may interesting listen author s voice  clearly professional reader  course expected     voice hoarse  rendition overall unpleasant listen  point i ended stopping listening cds short  i love audio books  recommended  unless special interest getting acquainted bradbury s voice  if listen good author s accomplished reader stories  try neil gaiman 
1,at first i thought fahrenheit sounded interesting  i glad seeth grade teachers assigned reading  by page  novel  however  i knew book i would enjoy  while s frightening  though thought provoking look way society could become  extremely badly written  bradbury goes pages nonsense  words leave enlightenment pages ago  he uses redundant adjectives  pointless sentences  i especially annoyed would go  inside  mr montag s thoughts repeat meaningless phrases  i would n t recommend book single person  condolances student forced waste time  fahrenheit books i would gladly toss fire 
1,how ironic book limiting access books not text to speech enabled  by preventing access tts  publisher denied blind husband opportunity read book kindle text to speech wants  he buy audio books publisher makes  he bought kindle express purpose able read books text to speech function  unfortunately  many books feature disabled  often simon  schuster  it especially ironic publisher would limit blind community s access kindle tts book centers around removing access books  everyone loses 
4,i believe book fahrenheit well written interesting  mr bradbury made book lot good vocabulary year old learn  this book better books i read school  prior reading book i never really liked science fiction books  this book changed dramatically  it taught fun facts like  reading n t know  paper burns degrees  wow book  n t even know people would ban future  lol  
2,i n t like book much  this boring book i ever read  i recommend book friends s boring   fahrenheit  guy montag  fireman  starts fire putout fires  in society  fireman set fires burn books  usually hear  fireman   always think job put fires  it totally different thought  right  this book censorship   people right read  in society  firemen rights burn  not books  houses people  in book  innocent woman burn house books  how fireman right burn human life  human life  especially book lover  how 
2,length    minsfahrenheitfahrenheit  a novel
3,i reading book i learned many interresting thing future  future fulled many possiblitys learning  hi
2,well  basically happens without boring details guy named montag fire fighter  the thing  job fire fighter start fires rather putting  well day burn old womens house really hits hard refuses get house light fire  so firemen burning house  books  old lady  that made think must something books worth dying  then girl clarisse made start thinking even  so sort came conclusion really enjoy living 
2,okay  first i would like say i enjoy almost book i read  this book made top  burn book  list  dont get wrong  idea well thought  book n t well written  first  book starts someone trying commit suicide  character saved even though s totally wack  second  main character named  guy montag   how origanal  third  people book idiots  i mean  first outlaw  offensive  material  condense great novels two page stories  around thier butt day watching  family  argue offend  the best character book simply dissappears middle book  found dead  not friends  not even spouse friend  what kind wack society n t friends  this book needs re written  seriously re done
2,as much i love ray bradbury books  good sense actor read farenheit  ray stumbles mumbles way book  point beautiful writing loses s power grace  ca n t recommend version  although last disc nice interview ray writing process 
5,i reading bookth grade advanced language arts  most students n t like think s confusing  love 
4,fahrenheit  fine novel  it belongs kind sci fi  really imbued meaning consequence  thus i would group great  litterary accepted  sci fi novels  like  nineteen eighty four    brave new world   i quite surprised abrupt ending novel  i think s short  it s kind like novella  while reading i thinking whether allusion tremendous fear reds communists s u s  
1,180 pages realized one quarter story even slightly interested continuing  visited amazon ans clicked one star reviews see frustration frustration  finish  force  book  finished  writing  stephen king points  almost wrote emphatically   n t use adverbs ever  sparingly  fahrenheit crammed full  said softly    said slowly   review  timewaster 
1,i admitting review relate actual book amazon apologies ray bradbury   ten bucks  really  come amazon  know book lot school reading lists  my kid loves kindle i buy school reading book lists   used book store  lost  in fact  weird circle irony  used buy books  got expensive  bought kindle  great  made books expensive   buy books  you lost opportunity  amazon  for record  hasnt picked kindle month too bad 
4,the lessons learned good authors timeless  reading book today wonders writer years ago could much insight society live today yes censorship  today s media advertising culture  people fed news told opinion   bother thinking  the parts book television media ties law enforcement chilling  light new  amber alerts  adopted across country good books make think world  makes wonder bradbury could known the afterward  coda  priceless  comments censorship  editing  far frightening people showing burn books   i go gently onto shelf  degutted  become non book   
3,fahrenheit  i huge fan science ficion  i decided read book class  it really distubring book future socitey  something really disturbs book  fire fighters starting fires true job put fires  what i like book clarisse helps montag understand books  s montag starts hiding books house  my opinion whatever  try read book  i know n t like  i know i n t 
3,i read fahrenheit book report class  this book good brought specific details people earth really think  things reading thinking  it shows world would people n t stop taking books granted start reading understanding things really help world today  this book n t really good made think  some people i know never read book life say boring fact n t time read  at times  i m like  but i know understand importance reading  eventhough i saying n t anything book  i m str8ning facts 
3,bradbury s attempt pull us futuristic world juxtaposed elements early half century amaze  it easy read  i found people expanded meanings novel bizarre form free flowing symbolism  they deemed modern american literature symbolism bible  title i personally abhor  it s good book  importance completely absorbed meaning weeks reading  this book s portrayal dentim s dentifrice could key understanding life  i seriously doubt 
2,the book although confusing  author uses much detail  intruiging  one things n t make sense reason character clarisse mclellan s dissapearance  the ending book sudden  rushed complete book 
2,i read fahrenheit year  seventh grade  required reading  as i read book  i got confused  the plot twisted turned left hanging wondering  wait   happened    mr bradbury used large words i learned vocab  i would recommend book age  maybe  i chose age hard concepts burning books fast moving plot hound 
4,as english teacher  i felt like loser i never read fahrenheit  i picked copy read it it s pretty good  i guess i avoided written ray bradbury i n t consider accomplished author  now i  the book might surprise  it science fiction best 
2,book really boring read book report instead reading whole book rented movie blockbuster watched movie much easier
2,i heard much book i finally picked  and i get around reading   i n t impressed  yes  author s ideas scary  that future  firemen set fires burn books  one firefighter  guy montag  begins look life closely discovers empty  he begins books home many places destroyed  clarisse  guy s next neighbor  seemingly set book stealing motion  interesting characters  unfortunately  disappears without much explanation  i see good messages vision future  i felt little bit cheated  i wanted get better glimpse society spawned fire fighter book burners  i m debating classic  i m saying personally good book 
2,sure  book gives harsh warnings desensitization culture withering away intellectual importance  radical premise detracts story s legitimacy worth  bradbury anticipates complete elimination books literature  i agree moving automated  fast paced society less emphasis love personal relationships  but never reach extreme level  simply rediculous concept  i contest worry whether others getting daily dose shakespeare  joyce bible  choose read  always chance  i imagine reading review  n t run high risk losing interest books lifetime  yes  bradbury offer striking prophesy direction societal development  use book basis outrcy culture s future ludicrous 
2,i huge science fiction fan heard many people ultimate sci fi classics  so  i decided read  i dissapointed  though concepts fairly interesting developed  book point  i understand novel famous  do waste time reading fahrenheit 
3,this book painted dark bleak future mankind  part future firemen n t fight fires rather burn books  why  because powers determined books could offend  confuse  depress  sadden people  etc fahrenheit depicts society best make books illegal burn order keep society  politically correct   just keep people happy watching television mindless activities i thought book well done depicting dilemna firefighter faces actions takes living working world the book probably deserves   stars 
2,fahrenheit unusual book alternate future  in book  firemen start fires instead putting  but n t randomly burn peoples houses  they burn ones people books  may thinking would books  well  alternate future  books illegal  i bet seems ironic  yes  book books  i n t like book  i felt writing style unusual  the author  ray bradbury  n t difficult sentences  seem jump around  he would never clear  within every page would jump around  lose readers attention rambling unorthodox style  if prime age group book would junior high schoolers high schoolers  that probably difficulty alternate future may appealing age 
3,this book confusing times   boring   right cruel  this future society messed like forreal sci fi drama dystopian world book 
2,this book hard read start  eventually infer going  little explained plainly  the copy i read library  mispelled sticky notes throughout looked like two middle schoolers trying figure going   for instance   why beatty ask  dose know books    the ending alright  i really liked quote inability build creates need destroy 
2,i read fahrenheit class eighth grade  beginning  i knew book would turn quite eloquent philsosphical  extremely tedious  i almost fell asleep occasions  bradbury good job describing sections story  sometimes gets carried away forgets mood  for example  city bombed  line chaos people inhabiting city running lives  in conclusion  i struggled book read coercion  i would never read 
2,this book boring  unless interested science fiction ray bradbury s work probably wont like  this book takes place future world books banned  people spend lot time watching television  montag  main character firefighter burns books  the story book ok gets boring excitement  the book easy read n t hard vocabulary  do n t read book fourth grade younger might hard read  stick movie interested topic 
3,it great book really understand going story others get lose reading  
3,the whole concept book bothered  it made think people persepctive  idea book burning something hard get reading book 
3,so  i ordered book consistent protesting fiance fantastic  maybe combination high built  fact i never forced read i school  impress  it okay book  i overly impressed  plus  i feel kinda cheated i pay much  compared kindle books  overall  i would recommend interested futuristic works  otherwise  best read 
4,this great book  i loved confuseing  i bet hard believe  i love confuseing books alot  if good book read  read f451
5,this marvellous book  i found full compelling text put  i recommend book anyone likes good n t put book 
4,  fahrenheit  metaphor freedom speech  it literary terms knowledge controlled burning books  ways accomplish  as world full people  running lit matches  ray bradbury basing attack every editor  censor  lobbyist  government see caretaker knowledge literature  control shackle words author dare speak out the question relevant present times  the news splattered stories doctored intelligence documents  bases dreaded events occurred 
4,bradbruy creates world censorship supposed simplistic fun  the main character  guy montag profession fireman  rather put fires  begins  his job destroy books  soon realizes world told  with help interesting supporting characters montag s life drastically changed  this really quick read pages  it definantly thought provoking whole message fits time period 
3,when i first read book  i incredibly lost  it first bradbury book i d ever read  i guess i n t used style  there many times i would reread   pages   times i confused going  the characters strange  i could n t ever tell side  really unpredictable  it s books need read quiet atmosphere focus bradbury s symbolism throughout book  if miss symbolism  n t get much book  i think s hard people really understand symbolism s book  s really purpose reading book  since n t understand 
4,i rarely read sf  i m fan general fiction books like prince tides the triumph glory  but i read fahrenheit class actually enjoyed  it chilling prophecy  world may well deteriorate conditions like described bradbury s classic book  books burned  i hope  though  amazon would lose even money 
5,i think writings amazing  i know many differ opinion i truly enjoy works  favorite writings  i think fascinating see much time influenced  how many things see movie creation like wall tv  flat screen   this book required reading youth i feel required today well  it s view world could easily occur allow rights flushed basically  how could easily fall dystopian world become complacent lack knowledge  i highly recommend book 
3,there really need review book everyone pretty much knows many reviews  the reason i n t love book really idea book  i mean book read think re bit smarter reading  and many levels would enough books nothing offer  only thing  book n t much fun read  its book short story 
4,in world presented mr bradbury  books illegal books older times  people hide hoard  someone caught books  house set fire firemen  people prevented fires instead starting  spare time spent watching tv instead reading  tvs huge  taking entire wall  some people try tv room  tvs walls  total immersion  main character s wife wants even though afford  rather eye opening appropriate commentary books vs tv 
1,i am a freshmen and i was required to read this book i am on page  i do n t get a word i have read  i feel like i m reading in a different language  maby it s because i m young or because i m only on page all i know is that i m lost i would like to thank all the other people who reviewed this book  you have helped alot

4,throughout novel  exposed many different things comparing world books words  main character guy firemen job world burn books find among people  this book repersents amount learning people future county tv keep going  book good book posibility telling people stop reading  there factors leading general lack interest reading factors make people actively hostile toward books  nature presented force innocence truth characters blood appears throughout novel symbol human s repressed soul primal  instinctive self  montag often feels revolutionary thoughts welling circulating blood  thsi book kept interested know crazy thing goin go next 
3,this book read sophomore english class  i liked  i understood teacher s explanation  i recommend book people like sci fi  things i n t get  futuristic things author s imagination  once actually get picture head futuristic things look like  book really good  author makes good point  i give three stars author n t describe unknown things better reader 
4,the firemen tomorrow put fires anymore    start  this story fireman doubting job absolutely riveting  guy montag thought happy  then girl named clarisse came onto scene  her sudden disappearance and or death leads unsettlement  when wife  mildred turns  must burn house  he finds hope group shabby old professors  ray bradbury must psychic write book hits close home  who knows  fahrenheit may future  this book must children read classroom 
3,i thought farenheit good book  it takes get point though  it starts little slow thats i mean  i really enjoyed description done bradbury book detail distinct  in first half book main character montag firefighter trys discover  after firefighter starts fires story  might get person  he wants know firefighters supposed burn books books bad in second half book montag starts use head stop letting everyone else control  he becomes fugitive action begins  he ends chased mechanical s hellicopters gets fights flamethrowers  i think sais second half story  the soft sci fi novel interesting gets thinking  i enjoyed alot hope everyone else gets chance read post opinion 
3,this book starts kind dull  we introduced fireman named guy montag fireman sets fires puts  his wife milly love t v family montag montag meats young spirited girl named clarrisa love world  the book goes saying books important lose interst fast 
2,read farenheit  first impression book screwed  mean like would read book  thats wrong  thing like book guy s wife  mildred  liked alot said t v family  little crazy though  liked part called firemen told guy books  walked  liked mechanical  something original  gave book  stars really thought waste time read  know  impression book writen by  jessica c 
2,i n t really book  fahrenheit far fetched though  i think material mentioned book really could happen future let  this fairly good book overall  i m rating   stars i confused  i freshmen high school whole literature pre ap class read fahrenheit assignment  now i know re probably thinking  well course s going confusing freshmen  but  i beg differ  this book written good i suppose  story jumps around much certain parts plain confusing  i e  dentham s dentifrice   well i say novel  i m sure i read i would enjoy  but i n t think book would much   stars 
4,the message book similar    writings ayn rand  at times message seemed    i m certain mr bradbury would subtle written years later 
3,this favorite books high school  reading certain charm  issue summed small quote interview included final pages   del ray  in introduction recently published bradbury  an illustrated life   wonderful book i spent hours immersed  ray bradbury  is n t incredible book   i issue brave new world  even though science fiction romps interesting times exciting  authors love prophetic ideas  hurts  sometimes even cramps writing  the ham fisted emotions guy montag bizarre nonsensical say least  characters suffer similar sort cartoonishness i see s great book high schoolers though 
3,my karina review pre ap summer project jarman middle school  i thought book every interesting read i kind think future idea little weird but story plot great i would n t recommend people age why  well  much i enjoyed parts i little trouble focusing  also i sort n t understand text now opinions people may liked alot 
4,this book interesting read  this first time reading issue censorship  i recently wrote essay censorship help book clearly made easier understand issue better 
4,i thought book going great since always teachers  lists recommended readings  but i felt story went bit slow  the first half book  interesting little confusing  but second half book story really picks  i would recommend book people like science fiction

2,fahrenheit book filled action suspense  if like book many twists turns  ll enjoy book ray bradberry  he tried write thought would worst future  books  they would set books onfire  read poses book unlawful  the people believed books made people upset  think different ideas  unequal  the firefighters know would set things fire  put fire like  this book fairly easy understand  middle schoollers able understand vocabulary 
2,the book  fahrenheit ray bradbury  perfect example science fiction book  this book life fire fighter named guy montag lives futuristic city books banned  the job fire fighters view future set books houses hiding fire  the reasoning books said evil contain many different thoughts emotions considered  dangerous  people exposed  this book pretty difficult read based challenging vocabulary confusing situations  i would recommend book people youngerth grade based content book  i would recommend people strong interest science fiction futuristic books 
2,not passionate science fiction reader  i enjoy bradbury s writing ideas form  i found book slow read  moving fast  some bradbury s ideas seem fit story  i found story far future relate  i found action burning books unreal society  i read stories bradbury part books  dandelion wine  fahrenheit match bradbury s works 
4,i got book read part nerdfighter summer book club  i glad i bought  this book amazing  it incredible think book written years ago ray bradbury pretty much predicted decrease book sales increase television viewers  this book awesome best books i ever read  it completely changed way i read books increased appreciation written word  i highly recommend book every single person able read honestly 
4,this amazing book  i decided read i found mr bradbury passed away even though s supposed fiction  seems way familiar  since unfortunately many people prefer wasting lives unimportant things rather spending time reading i highly reccomend 
5,the irony book always slayed  here book future books like drugs  outlawed  sold black market  s  library   firemen destroy  and added bonus main character  loyal fireman  library  the irony gets book banning books  yet banned book  nobody read   ha  kidding folks

5,this book merely value  it  good  book plot development alone  its insight life  however  knocks step  it profound warns us ignorant  entertainment society 
3,if i required read book college courses  i probably never would picked  but read i see importance  it forces reader look effect technology lives direction increasing technolgy could lead us  the plot interesting mind opening  the story would stronger impact bradbury left main character  guy montag  mentally stable novel  i felt  reader  craziness led unreliablity character actions  this unreliablity character left novel weak ending  instead strong 
4,fahrenheit book named montag  his occupation fireman  when book takes place  future  firemen making fires books instead extinguishing fires  montag meets girl s new neighborhood walks home  on way  finds clarrise mclellen  he found quite peculiar  clarisse asked questions like happy 
4,this book fine job creating dysfunctional  brainwashed american society future completely controlled dictator like government  the story easy follow never lossing hope everything around feels lost  the book n t much deep meaning behind  means basically reads reads  ray bradbury good author types  provides interesting scenarios characters 
4,i read book  i first read i school really enjoyed  i read even watched movie  book way better  very good message think books bad useless  books remind us past help us day day lives 
4,an interesting story book censorship consequences mankind allow get  this version book interview author i really enjoyed reading 
3,when i handed copy book i thought going     a clockwork orange    lord flies   sort thing  but i mistaken  the book kind shallow times left thinking     the whole book i waiting something big happen  nothing ever  the book however good points  bradbury odd writing style i m big fan  that  got  stars 
2,boring lik  lacked basic plot character development  disappointed novel bradbury 
2,i read book school  first i hated  the beginning chapter hard understand symbolism  however  eventually gets better   slowly  it easy miss concepts n t read slowly enough  i felt ending far fetched boring  i enjoy reading dystopian society  altogether  book tedious slow moving 
2,another dark  gloomy  mildly confusing  blade runner ishview future lacking redeeming qualities   in future  firemen burn books    bradbury createsan inventive premise gloom overtakes story fraught loose ends  last book readbefore set fire 
3,i really enjoyed book  one amazing stories see reflected many stories today  my complaint writing style felt like i reading long runon sentence  amazing read none less   
5,this fantastic book  felt like quality price fair well  i would recommend book 
1,bradbury good writer  i ll give   i hate writing style  he starts making huge long mini stories within main story point useless  he could written book less pages  might ve gotten  stars  i think terrible book  offense anyone likes 
3,this book extremly boring  true says lot future could  you see actually starting happen todays society  but fault giving new technology  all i read seems rate book tell future  if rating i would give   but s case  this great thought processing book well written  i advice children stay away would become disinterested fairly fast  if love think  understand interpret symbolic meanings  loves science fiction go for it   
5,i read book assignment i  i believe  the reason i write moronic kids  forced  read seem think sucks  well  let record show all schoolchildren idiots must interpret every line every book literally  i duly impressed book eventh grade    gets better older i get  the fact i  impoverished  well  know i mean  teenager  willing pay double price book signed copy says something 
5,if n t read book  i know thinking science fiction read ll thinking burn books kill people  you agree bradbury s ideas  i hope movie comes book eventhough bradbury n t like it maybe book remember movie 
4,very well written science fiction  despite written explosion modern technology  bradbury s book burning story makes many timeless observations censorship suppression original thought personal interaction bradbury s seashells earbuds parlors surrounding interactive screens hardly stretch imagine ever competed ipod flat screen another person s attention spoiler alertdespite many hopeless characters violent destruction  ending optimistic montag hideout professors devise way preserve classics 
2,if high school student  would stunner  anyone little life experience shred political awareness  book comes across dated  patronizing condescending 
1,fahrenheit great book read deadly listen cd  ray bradbury reads expressionless monotony  i tried listen first cd five times finally gave  stick book supply voices 
3,watch tv  sheeple in future  books banned  drugs good old electronic screen used keep population docile uninformed  firemen n t put fires  burn books found  big macho showy way  one bloke begins doubts occupation society  breaks away 
2,i frustrated sloppiness book  from i understand  bradbury sat library wrote weeks  shows  montag introduced happy job  the meeting clarisse blows mind  but bradbury throws numerous details indicating dissatisfaction mounting time  although montag purportedly divided mind  development character abrupt unconvincing  but develop essentially mouthpiece ranting  blech  bradbury s ideas fruition time   ironically  work literature  i understand work lauded classic 
2,this book pretty good  except definitely advanced  it confusing  especially  tv family  i understand  it adult book 
2,fahrenheit ray bradburyi didnt really like book  people rambling life sucks  whole worlds sucks  burn books  i dont know could enjoy book  people talk talk book  its guy named montage firefighter  he burns things instaed putting fires  he meets wierdo girl talks nonsense  guy starts think hes starts reading books gets caught  he burn books  he doesnt go jail runs away 
2,i struggled book  if i n t read school  i would dropped immediately  the story dark unhappy  writing style flat boring  it seems though author trying use big flowery words stuff  n t work  this horrible book 
1,hey a reader missouri  i hear  this book makes sense ever read school  i idesa world book horrible could stayed around years    i talked everyone i know read first  pages immeadiatly hated  they rented movie watched n t read  verbatum  guess   even worse book  i reccomend book   well find terrible books get find type flammable liquid burns better books 
2,dissapointing  cause heard book thought suppose masterpiece  reading discoverd writing poor  story bery weak  plot dull i think book lost s taste  similat book like prefferd read 
2,bradbury set forth interesting ideas prophecies book far entertaining suspensful goes i would give  f  grade  it squeeks two stars 
3,i read book school  i know marked classic  found incredably boring overdone  i thought overrated  i read trashy entertaining books  read classics  i like read trash  entertainment know trash entertainment  i found characters book shallow  like clarisse  developed  it bland meaningless people make  and phoenix metaphor  that chiche  i would n t say bad book  mean fairly well written  found  similar cautionary note dystopian novel much meaningful 
1,this book worst i read   classic still bad    i read school i hated  it soo simple  only thing happens entire book thing n t even exciting 
1,i read book hated  do n t waste money  it ruin respect books  three words  do n t buy it      
1,first assigned read book class  started lame  get worse  cares firefighter burns book   could write book  books  ten times better  maybe books names talked maybe would caught attention 
1,this book really sucks  it makes sense whatsoever waste time  ray better things
1,i m advocate book burning  burn book  it terribly disappointing  lots hype cheesy science fiction novel  there two major problems  one poor language usage  lousy descriptive word choices  lousy metaphors similes make inappropriate comparisons  two  enough attention paid societal problems give rise things like book burning first place  threat individual group  government control sheep like masses  modern epidemic people s lack interest anything intellectual  timeless epidemic fear anything goes group mentality upsets status quo   bradbury touches issues  leaves largely undeveloped

3,this really well done album  lacks variety songs  if paying attention  even notice song ends next begins  that said  music beautiful  i hard time understanding lyrics  singing style accent  makes hard connect emotionally songs j ja
4,an amazing star cast show serious acting chops dark drama thriller told segments concentrating different points view experiences revolving around death young woman  harrowing  moving  suspenseful  films draws sudden suprising conclusion realistic shocking  a great character piece paints complicated portraits character good  bad  neurotic  i would describe film dark told conviction lack heavy handiness s entertaining  toni collete always gives incredible performance alongside quasi walking legend piper laurie  mary steenburgen  giovanni ribisi  kerry washington  many others including stand performances amazing mary beth hurt right target brittany murphy  nobody almost insane and or drugged better   a good film elevated amazing cast inspired performances 
5,it s definitely best movies i seen past  years  amazing performances  great cast story 
2,a dead girl found field leads us several stories kind involve  each dark dreary slow  toni collette piper laurie reinact carrie first segment adds nothing film  actually  wife    dead girl  seem really worth watching dark slow dreary  lots good people  real mystery suspense  really kind depressing s make entertainment  the real world depressing enough 
4,i ll admit i bought movie james franco  i enjoy looks  strong actor intrigued years  that said  part n t biggest  best  he best could part given  segment  movie divided  segments  mainly focused rose byrne s story  she gives excellent performance  likely best film the  remaining performances  centered women  held together strong female performances  i found toni collette s part emotionally touching  brittany murphy good job well  she bit indulgent times  i always admired acting skills  this movie exception overall  movie pretty depressing  the story moving engrossed  i n t say i would recommend unless hard fan actors  the plot interesting  acting real story 
3,i n t realize i movie already  but i actually bought recent death brittany murphy wanted reminder movies 
4,this movie definitely everyone  it presents dark  disturbing reality left moved haunted several days  the movie well made  though  every theatrical aspect  i rate highly  i usually n t movie presented segments chapters  movie s form storytelling masterfully accomplished hands director  acting performances outstanding  i walked away lot emotions lot ponder seeing picture   sign excellence book  just n t view looking something light uplifting 
4,when i rented movie i n t realize stories different women murder links  it begins toni collette shy caretaker abusive old woman  when finds body murdered woman shocked fascinated  she realizes life short sitting place letting people make feel worthless acts  the movie continues me preparing body  the me thinks dead girl could missing sister  her life family frozen since sister went missing  her parents n t accept daughter might dead  this weighs heavily remaining daughter wants get life  obsession finding sister overwhelms  we get meet dead woman s mother  roommate  dead girl  i ve never seen movie quite like i found interesting character study mystery 
5,i really like movie  it i would stronglyrecommend friends good movie buffs  it bestthe first time see surprises thatyou n t know see  watch movie 
3,i think fine film respects  i n t  i n t dissuade people watching deciding  go check library  do n t buy it the characters the dead girl pathetic unhappy  no relate people  well i couldn t i saw lantana seeing  perhaps s i n t terribly impressed movie i wish would n t bought  we n t watch 
1,that s n i e t z s c h e  wrote bears relation movie in stinker  seem like predators  unappealing best  women victims  if reality  reality l a anywhere  i part  in experience  people classes kind spark charm  this film mistakes vileness vapid  blank suffering profundity realism watch suffer  on second thought  n t  the unappealing group people i ve ever fast forwarded recent memory  even worse the hawk dying i like dark films  rub yer nose vile stupid avoid costs  yech 
3,i eagerly anticipated watching movie  duration  lived billing it jolts start lonely caregiver stumbles upon gruesome corpse young woman  the movie segments describe women  way  linked victim  these segments well acted  poignant  brief perspectives woman s life  moment looks like might become truly great movies recent years  and sort leaves hanging  wondering  it feels characters seeking closure  yet closure something think movie over this movie s real flaw  though  it beautifully scripted  written  acted  ah

2,i n t go plot reviewers already given rather complete synopsis  after beginning book character development weak disappointing  annie starts strong  quirky individual mid book s hung jake looses charm strength character  jake angst ridden enjoy  the secondary characters problems brought book  that  major maritial problem resolved sex sauna well  female character  melts     pun intended  i guess i anticipated stronger female male characters  ones i get   i think ms wells shows promise next book i ll get library 
3,jake annie likeable characters book  i agree reviewers  i agree fizzled pretty quickly  i read whole book enjoyed  many things plain unbelievable ms wells tried weave plot  how many women would enter marriage believing unknown guy best interests baby heart  annie could really set unhappy ending jake turned self serving  i mean  could married sued worth custody  fortunately  book s planned no surprise ending kept things even keel annie  madeline jake  maybe i m hardened  novel n t even provide halfway believable escapism  despite  ms wells delivers fine characterization shows potential future endeavors 
2,too much time spent secondary characters much time spent apart main characters made slow reading  i really liked jake begin i eventually came really  the initial conflict strong  author seemed drift jake s in law s relationship  the final conflict resolved easily really buy it but s bad  ms wells writing voice smooth easy  i d interested see comes future

2,while joyce s ulysses demonstrates monstrous success literary experimentation styles  fw  i find poor standards  in academics  among pseudo intellectuals  book quite fashionable  understably  style unique  its almost comical listen fellow joyce fans rave  but whenever i corner  beg dissect work  responses incoherent book  perhaps inspires creative thinking translation readers  nothing sort part  despite repeated efforts sincerely read it i ve read far worse  s sure  someone thinking dabbling joyce first time seriously consider selecting substantial earlier works  frustration fw may alienate forever otherwise brilliant often powerful author

5,im ussualy something much brutal  insane  gore likes hatebreed n t deny tha fact enjoy music alot  i seen guys ozzfest  enjoy performance alot  like music attracts kinds people   some makes like even  i quess s hatebreed  okay  hatebreed s new album  rise brutaly  well  perseverance  pretty amazing itslef   support hatebreed  ps  i hate fact put slipknot category hatebreed   f ck slipknot  suckkk        only posers listing slipknot  f ck em 
1,hatebreed s another pesky  hardcore  band destroying scene  a bunch   guys yelling beliefs n t even  sounds kind like slipknot  that s hardcore mentality    hatebreed assumed forerunner victory records  keeping good bands like grade  shelter  snapcase playing main stage  instead  open cross nu metal rock roll 
5,wow    just insane i like  no rapping  no singing  no slow parts      it short still well worth    closest thing sound like probably soulfly  every single track is good    i cant even say slipknot  although  slipknot best band  another band check mudvayne  
4,this n t mean bad  simply mainstream  i mean  dont bother tagging unless widely known band  hatebreed fanpleasers  great live  strangely undertstandable vox album  they ve got emotion many bands formula lack  thats set apart others  they ve got feeling hxc temps mxc  it s much blend two  interpretation  this beyond mediocre  going blow away  they talent sound like slight maturing sound keeps going strong  this people see defining album  nothing sort  simply excels set  breakdowns designed mosh seems  get 
5,people call huge hatebreed fan  n t  let alone fact probably never heard minutes brutality hatebreed s indie debut  i n t say new stuff sucks  rocks   even better  go newbury comics somewhere find great underground metal check  especially like perseverance rise of brutality 
5,this cd works wonders people  if i fight mike tyson  i would make sure cd fight  this cd sick  my likes  
3,nice shoe apparantly brand runs narrow another pair shoes ran narrow

4,all i know book lot family history  hard find  i ve heard available limited viewing saint john the baptist catholic church johnsburg illinois could n t find  in case find i m sure cost arm leg 
5,many piano vocal reductions musicals completely different original score  this stays surprisingly true  though left hand missing lot interesting rhythms  many vocal harmonies present  the keys songs movie  intros  choruses  verses intact  some interludes dances shortened omitted  however  if re looking karaoke cd  try itunes 
3,this easy read surgery text date techniques tests  however  numerous errors text  for part simple ones  easily reasoned  i e  gastric ph decreased ppis    seventh edition kind sloppiness calls question integrity rest text

1,i realise book containing  professor books i already read i would bought i aware 
1,this would worst dam movie i ever seen good plot  i used much dam movie disappointing
3,very simaler to a w o l if you are a van damme fan you will like it alot better that knock off
4,in truth  i thought van damme  last films uninspired  humourless  shameless retreads better films worse actors  but legionnaire redeems oeuvre ignoring throughout much film  giving best lines drama group relatively unknown excellent character actors  the editing flawless  let s  director ever went broke ripping lawrence arabia  i love van damme films  i m telling everybody rent s true van damme picture 
2,  stars action scenes great  plot simplistic semblance drama pathetic  irritating stabs shallow sentimentalism worn cliche  worth renting worth buying unless good action shots van damme fanatic  i sell dvd i  a previous review compares glory  i consider comparison far fetched  unless action sole criteria 
2,legionnaire really good much acting  really good action  van damme stick katate movies acting movies
1,van damme s movies going nowhere  worser last   then good idea came  n t try make kind  epic  movie  taking lengendary theme  french unit called  foreigner legion   changing custumary scenario karate kicks sterotyphed villains rule world  great idea  i bought  so  disapointment watching this  became clear  matter many movies already made  van damme never improve actor   every frame movie wasted  making us think bad orientated agents film producers  it s totally unconving history  without pace rhythm  
4,i grew loving movies books foreign legion  misfit recruits  brutal sergeants  doomed stand odds lonely desert fort  so trepidation i watched  legionnaire   i never previously watched movie starring jean claude damme  i fan martial arts movies  would mess pointless anachronisms  legionnaire kick boxer  but i happily surprised movie  all basic elements good foreign legion movie present production values first rate  the cast strong  standard stereotypical misfits becoming legionnaires legion s  marche creve  spirit  this film means movie great art  s solid  well done entertaining  movie comfort food  i loved 
4,van damme shows another aspects movie  contains humanity  friendship  frustration  good fight scenes  it worth seeing 
4,this good van damme movie  it best movie  but i would say best acting  great action scenes 
4,van damme scores big movie  finally picked movie decent supporting cast good story  unlike previous films  van damme s kickboxing martial arts skills blended nicely real life situations drama  this movie deserved theatrical release  action tasteful movie quick meaningful pace  some characters tired dialogue presecuted  aside actors fit roles  overall movie ranks among van dammes better emotional roles  lionheart tug heart strings  well legionaire angle 
3,damme s performance pretty good  better expected  film looks great absolutely worth video buck 
4,i went store saw movie counter van damnes got  watched  i wasnt pleased  mean movie excellent  hell van damnes high flying kicks  i like huge fan van damne this like movie didnt see fancy kicks this movie worth watching  wan see kicks dont get 
4,i heard reason n t get theater releases van damme s previous   knock off  dud   legionnaire  definitely best  the movie great story beautifully shot  action sequences reminiscent  glory    the young indiana jones chronicles  the supporting cast lends great acting overall movie must overlooked  this aint usual  kick butt  van damme film  much better  give film chance ll see deserves theatre first audience  also dvd well done animated menus tons historical footage documentaties foriegn legion 
4,it s shame movie n t theatrical release  it s best foreign legion flicks around  bit short plot makes solid action sequences  van damme playss boxer excaping legion double crossing crooked boxing promoter losing girlfriend process  the very overated  beau geste   comparison  definitely better story line  gary cooper way old play title role s wooden  admittedly  van damme might win oscar good job part solid ensemble cast lesser known actors playing usual riff raff joining ffl  black america  italian  german  mysterious englishman  overall  see  march die   gene hackman  it   great action sequences   legionnaire  good movie 
4,you n t watch van damme movies acting  realism historical accuracy with good reason however  predictable clichés highly unlikely events aside  film pretty decent  lots action which van damme best  worth re legion fan 
4,this typical chop socky van damme flick  heck  van damme n t even crescent kick  cherished trademark  instead  s movie french foreign legion sent africa  van damme plays alain  fugitive boxer signs legion way escape gangsters  this happens within first minutes  the large bulk film alain befriending fellow legionnaires learning values friendship even time  true  movie rather predictable many characters seem cliche  cinematography  score  surprisingly  acting average  even van damme pulls convincing performance  proving s given good script  believable  the reason  million film never released theaters downbeat ending  do n t fooled direct to video nature  though  this good war action fan 
2,i purchased book i read good reviews  i really like  the story dull  heroine uninteresting hero hero  idiot  
3,overall  promise  trying  size  i ordered  size  i small skipperkee  lbs  able easily slip harness  she like much works get  if bit smaller  bit larger  i think would work well 
5,i bought gift friend  lab shar pei mix  even though s head bit smaller pictured front product  fit perfectly friend seen great results walks  used pull like mad  behaving really well thanks little contraption 
5,after new furry family member chewed two gentle leader collars three months  i went search something new  we collar nine months still piece  the nose loop slip like collar  n t eat  and even managed  material thicker stronger  our lb lab bulldog mix  out pull husband standard neck collar  but head collar really minimizes ability desire pull  i control two fingers leash  huge difference  love 
5,i bought halti brand first   this brand better   soft piece material goes nose pet  this best thing i could purchased dogs  it definitely works   i  strong willed boxers try control   product lifesaver   thank  thank  thank    
2,tried everything hated  go  even though set snug fit  kept pawing finally able get mouth chew 
3,so second time used  golden retriever chewed almost part would rendered useless  that said  could considered fault  i m positive  we followed directions  collar actually works pretty well overall  meaning pulls jerks head side bit really irritates   still get part nose get mouth  also walk n t use collar  still bad pulls ever 
4,purchased smalllb jack russell  he constantly pulling standard collar  point quick pulling back correct looked like animal abuse  he initially tried back collar  got used fairly quickly  he try paw time time  re moving   ie  time think   we years ago lab pulled like freight train  they work  now calm walks 
4,i knew reading reviews sizing runs large  the company suggested size  lb english setter  i ordered  based reviews  it s still big  i n t believe need size  otherwise  i love design  much better premiere gentle leader  slides nose eyes rubs 
4,definitely big pound yorkie  i able tighten around neck sewing works great  it takes get used makes difference walking 
3,it s really hard gauge going fit properly without trying  we bought right size  pull easily  n t work us i guess recommendation would try store committing 
1,they sent imitation  holt china instead advertised halti  cut s  i tried contacting  response 
4,tycho twice size normal shiba  currently pounds purebred  he s rescue  re homed due anxiety issues getting trouble  this head halter gives us confidence keep control matter scared gets many delicious cats sees  tycho know throw head halter s upset  n t matter  the halter securely connected collar  time s tossed  ve caught s safely control if concerns pulling walks slipping collar  great solution  it may couple tries get right size  effort well worth 
2,at first  i happy product n t pulling nearly hard  but i noticed side strap pushes eye  making water become irritated  walk  i tried fixing problem nothing worked  kept going eye  the product definitely waste money 
5,my puller i petite woman bad back found difficult walking spunky lb lab  prior purchasing holt  i using gentle leader premier truly liked  both collars similarly designed  the dislike i gentle leader nose loop  it n t supportive cushion required leaving skin raw the holt collar designed cushioned nose band adds extra protection what i appropriate premier gentle leader informative dvd provided instructed properly fit collar properly use it transitioning two leaders minimal nothing  i would recommend either products  life saver   
4,really work said would instant control  nice walking n t pull feet moment go  longer walks ease
1,the collar actually works fine s halti  it s holt  looks works s halti i ordering 
4,this walking collar really made difference  my pulling alot i n t enjoying walk  i could n t wait get home walk  now  go sometimes twice distance used pulling  there side piece hangs sometimes put paw get collar  but i started wrapping piece around neck collar n t distract  i would definitely recommend collar pulls walk 
5,what great invention  not fits doberman german shepherd mix  works  my tends pull walk  especially sees another  this training collar distracts pulling positioned mouth  she like initially tried  concentrated walk itself another nice feature collar adjustable front nose  hot outside pant open mouth the collar supposed attach regular collar wears time  although i used single collar 
3,i really liked thing first  walks chewed part goes underneath snout 
1,i excited collar seemed work  my obviously n t like tried paw long i kept moving occasionally pawed n t pull  he usually pulls nearly constantly despite efforts  however half way second walk pound stopped sniff something  i kept going strap goes around nose broke  do n t waste money 
3,i turned around half second  mo  puppy part mouth chewed right 
2,the strap lasted day  tied labradoodle outside shop i came back chewed threw bottom strap  the funny thing sitting waiting like nothing happend  even though lead detached i tied  i think strap around snout big needs adjustable  i get next size see go 
3,this second halti i purchased two different dogs  the halti worked well first  staffordshire terrier   however  even though properly fitted head  second  bull terrier  figured chew way strap went around snout  thank goodness safety loop  the company s  unconditional guarantee  cover type damage 
3,i ve finally learned lesson  today chewed third halti   she chewed last minute i back tending daughter  i n t contacted company  yet they work great not durable 
3,service seller excellent  halti sizing  however   i went s weight  lbs  purchased size   it slips head problem  tightened anymore  maybe size based circumference head  very disappointed since i use product return postage plus replacement postage would price new 
1,the halti must correctly sized  unfortunately sizing info determine correct size poor  the holt sizing chart based breeds  n t work mutt  way big  why n t provide sizing info based circumference muzzle neck 
1,this probably good product dogs square jaw lines owners small dogs lhasa apso shitzu beware  because flatter facial structures  collar slips n t hold  and speaking experience  size issue i e  even small size n t work 
5,this walking collar greatest design  i great upper body strength control excited boxer  she walks next like supposed  no pulling street  bravo
5,i estimate endless fortune save  i slr developed film  i got tired darkroom cost  still  developed even quickie  mail order sites cost fortune  worse  trying good picture kitty goes zoom zoom zoom ruin nearly whole roll film scream  with  pop camera click day  i held slr long i felt way something simply could quality  wow  colours true  images brilliant so sharp  too picture kitty four foot away could see flea nose picture  get good camera like fuji finepix zoom  get cards takess pictures  it puts fun back taking pics  
3,i payed extra next day delivery four days later  im still waiting  next time i n t use amazon 
1,although card fit well rio500 mp player  i call simpletech s  punch long phone tree reach helpful technician  he explanined rio s n tmb  i ll send back pay shipping find way verify compatibility ordering

1,this latest stargate movies  plot stargate captured dangerous enemy preparing trial crimes committed  however tells things change  somehow manages change time stargate found team formed know while idea good  i m sorry say movie profoundly tedious  exciting i hoped  so alternate universes please check star trek deep space nine books idea used as movie sorry stargate fans worth 
2,i ve seen better episodes tv  forgettable  n t even remember n t long ago i saw 
3,after rushing buy  ark truth  bitterly disappointed  nice surprise  it familiar feel series loved  cleverly written  the story keeps hopping  promises pull shelf watch regular basis  the downside upsetting dust ark truth  sitting next   
4,as sg1 fan  i enjoyed episode much  people new series might trouble keeping  however  n t dvd sets  grin  i n t wait next    that s hint

5,i hope keep making direct to dvd stargate films  the tv show outstanding i loved ten seasons  the previous  ark truth  direct to dvd movie terrific maintains high production quality  storyline acting somehow  managed get practically actors portraying various heros villians years back together story  for example  lots cameos best  system lords  loved hate tv show if re stargate fan  n t miss this my regret i bought dvd last week  best buy i could ve rented    least dvd includes hours bonus material production two kentucky thumbs stargate cast crew 
2,not bad could lot better  overall dissapointing  they could least noted happened ori leaving fans hanging series ending  not worth buying 
2,story without bunchline good others stargates i bought
5,if fan stargate series see series movie great movie must see i got fast ordering

5,wonderful movie close stargate sg1 saga  a must see whole family  guaranteed wonder amusement
3,i love entire stargate series bit letdown overall  ohh well  least i complete collection shelf  wife loves  p
4,a nice conclusion sg1  it great see rda back  it cleared last open issue left taot 
4,this review contains spoilers  do read n t know s film i liked move i love stargate  i love characters  however    the movie completely lacking emotional exploration characters  delving character impact separation isolation alternate reality  case daniel  loss limb  might added minutes time  would significantly improved movie  i m tired lazy  sloppy writing  stargate great show themes characters  actors   poorly treated writers  this show needs given someone else  someone gives   art 
5,a fan since beginning i ve seen every show was loved final  hour wrap stargate  even never watched show  would fun like sci fi  i enjoyed several fun things ben browder slipped taking command starship   fact many past  bad guys  back last peek  love owning   nothing like rainy day snacks great stargate watch 
2,i hard stargate fan   movie really bad   wish stargate would stop taking advantage loyal fan base making straight dvd movies   end series put back air    would much prefered pay  go see big screen vs buying expensive dvd  
3,i like lot  considered mouvie anothe episode put mouvie format hoping 
3,although quality film great  acting great  special effects amazing  story like episodes  it interesting  movie material  however good see team back action  maybe next time mini series  something doesnt involve way done  officially cheesy  theme time travel  parallel universes 
3,it n t great ark truth  but believe whole season get story pretty much movie could two part episode  it still utterly enjoyable  fans since first sg episode enjoy jack back  hes back s witty self  love ba al jack banter awesome  i think watched behind scenes stuff ll little expectant n t may enjoy  for big fans def reccomend especially missed seening jack goa uld daniel banter 
3,tv led believe o neil  anderson  would  leading sg team     false advertising least  story better  ark  i expecting favorite character 
3,enjoy  longer  extended episode  it lot flaws  magic old sg stories  familiar  if n t really collecting movies anything  i recomment renting borrowing friend rather buying dollars 
3,they change title  stargate reunion   re hash old story lines return many sg characters  it s like compiling several scripts form different episodes  dissapointed writers i feel price i paid worth watching  if get cheaper  buy  rent  it s theose  watch  movies 
3,it interesting spin alternate time line  however  n t movie i would watch  i must say i little disappointed  the upside movie closure longer running story lines 
3,the producers writers hyped show going back older  early season feel sg  i think movie would better series episodes rather full length movie  the plot ok i thought ending rushed bit cheat  granted  matter personal preference i disappointed claudia black get screen time 
2,a predictable thrown together movie make bucks otherwise outstanding series  better  ark truth   much 
5,loved seeing jack  stargate addicts  i m big fan new sg1leader movie still good watch
3,i agree reviewers thought movie n t quite standards feature length movie  i expected bit  however  considering second stargate feature film  year  maybe i expected much  after  writers pitching fit episodes year tv series days  the first seasons sg contained least episodes  ds seasons typically contained episodes  it s tough life writing sci fi i guess i agree continuum certainly better movie the ark truth  based upon flicks  looks like re treated stargate sg season roughly  hour episodes every four months  i wonder november episode entail  
5,what great addition sg series  this best stories series  i ve watched twice eager third time it s great see jack back  course  the story line kept guessing  action scenes good overdone  the cg absolutely amazing fits without looking gimicky this movie really brought back feel first series  yet characters span series  i think everyone writers  actors  production crew spot movie 
5,when i saw first time i impression i looking oscar prize movie i seen ending   sometime first minutes second view i realize dvd   oscar  bad  it s better  ark   better  children gods  sometimes better first  stargate   kurt russel   rick great  usual   what i say  s stargate fans  s anyone anything   it s great  and i guess right o neill asked    
5,really enjoyed  got couple weeks ago watched twice already  actually whole sg1 thing film the ark truth past weekend  told wife based fact  left alone  sure hope  anyway film the ark truth  well worth money sorry bought 
5,from opening scene  realize movie already  great film  very well done  worthy collection stargate sg1 junkies 
4,the entertainament quality average series sg1  i think film reached quality level stargate atlantis 
5,i upset took series air  i m glad movies still wish series still around  love movie 
3,save money  cheaped big time blu ray version  the picture quality horrible  shame ripping fans like     we pay       extra  bucks top get blu ray high quality  deliver pixelated grainy so called  movie   s better double episode tv series  price approaching entire season dvd 
1,the producers franchise know great fan base  several years making intelligent entertaining sci fi series i think ve given intellectual laziness  if  continuum  new standard  fans  expect see future franchise  stop making films  the plot  continuum  silly  narrative  story told  completely bland devoid life  it though characters know  suddenly souls written script 
3,ok film  first time viewed  do n t need see  more wife s thing  
2,i ve seen every stargate sg1 atlantis episodes movie the reason i n t like thing i loved shows part  clean  this couple almost goryscenes  not mention swearing like star trek    sudden heroes many years start potty mouths  s unnecessary  i looking forward new sg1 tackle something new  rehash old thing  it seems like the industry turning dark side success top dark knight succesful  feel good adventure need comeback  please bring sg1 team back good adventure 
1,i purchased stargate continium i received sent steel magnolias instead i contacted company  times anf d  weeks i heard nothing i purchasing anything amazon partners
2,i gone dvd  the image quality worst blu ray collection  it looks like dvd  actually  that said  bogs htpc blu ray collection  it stops  lurches  sound gets really sync  it flips completely frames displays randomly colored pixelated image the movie good rompin  episode sci classic  but save money get dvd update  i upgraded firmware lg drive solved issues disc  the lurching stuttering syncing problems gone  it still goes bonkers pixelated image time time  for part  disc watchable  but s still disappointing blu ray 
5,if stargate fan  movie must  when couple team begin disappear thin air remaining team hits stargateth century stargate yet invented  we favorite familiar characters  course  go north arctic russia find frozen stargate  make things work allowing return time things made right right world  we watched prime member free computer tv  monitor  wonderful 
2,pleasent satifying fluff  it s always worth watch baal s machinations  would played better episode sorry i n t say 
2,not taste   stargate  continuum  old plot reused  stargate sg  well sci fi stories general  the first half lacking action  n t see much o neill  he shows first minutes film last  s  and story lacking structure  the second half movie n t bad  still worth wasting money on not recommended 
2,the quality image compression up converted dvd ark truth i watched days  there comparison watching arctic scenes  so so  vs planet earth blu ray  great   not sure d even release blu ray unless re pulling fast one the story holes bigger gate  when time changed  people disappearing like back future style  poof  the paradoxes ridiculous  like baal able travel back stop stargate arriving us   would n t know earth first place  baal get anubis s ship  daniel s leg reappear  make mitchell hero  d think mil budget  d pull better script together i think thing i enjoyed vala villain 
3,since i m huge stargate fan s always fun see group together but i admit bit booring subject episodes  back future 
2,this movie includes traditional  stargate  favorites  jack o neill general landry  without humor made series enjoyable  it plays though writers director checklist instead script  quip oneill check  brilliant insight carter check  moral stance daniel jackson check  none elements truely integrated  watching convoluted large disappointment 
4,another sg mega episode keeping sg tradition  if liked tv show  please  it n t something would well movie theater  price  great night s entertainment  enjoyable  sad see actors last sg role  general hammond  example   nice see actors privious episodes n t seen long time  i recomend 
5,entire stargate sg box set ark truth movie   favorite                     continued story line evil suave gould bal well crafted keeps edge seat sofa bean bag   ever setting   huge sg fan  watch 
5,movie arrived quickly  just good new  a    surpassed expectations  bought movie cheaper i could rented 
4,it enjoyable movie  nice see many familiar faces  even make cameo appearance  like colin cunningham i liked story  timetravel  alternate realities always fun  good quality picture impressive scenes arctic  i hope get see movies  good see don s davis general hammond  miss 
5,sg1 continuum  great movie  the cgi flawless great movie  i hope n t last mgm

4,being japanese american  i raised around rice cookers since birth  the old models family used lid bobbing steam generated  rice perfect regardless  the  fancy  models sold  overkill  this machine follows  kiss  principle t while lid n t bobble anymore due vent  works fine  the thing keeping  stars i see water level markings  they color non stick coating

4,cooks rice  including brown rice  well  i tried quinoa came well  it easy operate clean  only problem exterior gets quite hot 
4,there n t many english language histories inter war poland  book welcome  it easy read provides many interesting details subjects  often regarded days obscure  inter war danzig poland s troubled relations lithuania cezchoslovakia  in many ways  popular history academic history  little say inter war economy social structure poland  its account polish diplomacy could little rigorous  author  though clearly sympathetic poland  flinch awkward facts  one drawback book hardly draws modern research

4,i say musiq s best cd far  his lyrics   real  unlike rappers   n t sing thing   sings real situations   like  babymother  omg i loveee song   keep it up musiq    
2,1  the intro   soulstar       youloveme   first single   forthenight     somewhere  momentinlife    thereason   otherwise  less stellar album 
2,i fan musiq  n t get wrong  i really liked first two albums  i thoroughly outraged i bought heard  soulstar   nowhere level  it lacks much  soul  ironically labels  honestly  pick  dwele  subject    kem  kemistry  instead  this album hot  n t believe hype  and whoever said musiq level maxwell  must deaf  at rate  best song entire album  forthenight   night   play frequently radio  if re curious  let friends lend    ask burn   i would n t recommend blowing hard earned moolah soul less atrocity

2,reach this album easily his best music date cat n t sing me  nothing every seems change now he one lucky cat tribute shows  projects he gets with but far being elite artist  do n t believe hype thsi album he trying tap r kelly  d angelo  maxwell s world  come way short 
2,what s good album  his first album classic second good  this whack  his voice like glenn lewis  bilal  maxwell d angleo  come  people deaf  he n t carry note 
4,i disagree naysayers album  i feel musiq trying reach experiment tracks   momentinlife  nice collaboration kindred cee lo  though i felt  dontstop  really wasted potential energy could shared musiq s crooning bilal s ethereal falsetto   forthenight  seems like classic loverman get them out the club and into the bed type song  musiq polite seems natural go  best track  givemorelove leaveamessage   thanks sample tom scott  i buy hear original   i m waiting next lp 
5,when i first bought album  i n t sure i felt  unlike immediate love first two  but recently i pleasure seeing musiq concert made go reevaluate rediscover classic i sitting since first came   the entire album beginning well put together  out tracks  favorites  musiq  keep best  
4,soulstar  soulchild  whatever  keep musiq coming    musiq talented  original artist  not eclectic erykah badu kind way  like curtis mayfield  shucks cd good first time i listened car i stopped package store get pint hennessy    it s old school brown liquor good     like good vintage wine  keeps getting  better  better listen    his creativity monopoly game  womanopoly  sick   fantasia  baby mama  anthem  musiq keeps real  babymother   aijuswanalisen   
4,this album recommended several musiq fans  and cd player last  days i admit great cd  however compared first album best work  the topics chosen deep first cd guest singers  soulstar  necessary  other i would recommend cd along w first  if bought wouldnt dissapointed 
3,this cd definitely grow  it x mas gift  i n t feelin  like first two cds  i still havent able listen beginning sitting  i like songs  lot skipable  if dont already  buy first two save money   whoknows  intro two songs really stood  there couple others i n t remember names    commercial cd  i still feelin   forthenight   the vocals  lyrics  harmonies really nice  s i went far give three  hopefully musiq bring notch next cd 
4,pleasantly surprised  having missed hype   album  i purchased i previous two  out  cd s i purchased  s top two  he s original  lyrics interesting  music make think move time  love 
4,all people gave musiq  stars die hard musiq fans  although i enjoyed album  definitely fails comparison albums  musiq  usually deep profound lyrics sends thought provoking messages n t quite time  he definitely could kept single entitled babymother  i mean title alone speaks  i must say gigantic fan aijuswanaseing juslisen  i must reluctantly admit reach bar i know reach  do n t let discourage good album  good others 
5,i love main  he stevie time  his music remains soulful entrenched meaning  i love beats lyrics  he continues explore soul music  be the intro bangin   i love    especially  i honestly put  albums rotation entertained hours  cop album 
4,at first i n t really album  couple listens  i love  neo soul stay musiq greatest  my favorite tracks womanopoly  babymother  who knows   this cd hot i n t wait next 
5,musiq put together solid project third effort soulstar  the album incredibly self assured focused  it rare i enjoy cd first listen  soulstar worthy recognition  in addition use guest stars cee lo kindred momentinlife carol riddick soulstar seem forced  well throughout executed idea  as i said review year ago juslisten  it took grow  soulstar grabbed first listen  i plan continue hear musiq say 
2,come on    i musiq fan core  but need unclever words story scenarios  the song worth listening first intro  i forced listen rest  womanopoly  baby mama drama  what love longs decent ones  the second cd keeper  musiq practice craft lose fan  also   stop remaking original songs do not voice 
2,i pretty disappointed cd  n t think i ll buying another musiq cd seems going downhill  he s basically regurgitating first two projects much success  i really like musiq s whole vibe  hopefully s late brother pick back 
3,a memoir woman s attempt understand history culture shaped el salvadorian husband  she wants make part early life able pass culture  while provides good basic introduction el salvador  including history  economy  geology  search understanding seems half hearted  as engaging portrait life people el salvador  s disappointing  however  lot information country  planning travel might find descriptions interesting 
3,i bought game used  expecting play xbox  to surprise i inserted game xbox i got message saying game needs update play check xbox website  lesson learned  always check compatibility list xbox website buying old game  it list original xbox games work  ubisoft seems abandoned game xbox latest release formats  so unless still running first generation xbox avoid game 
3,the game pretty good  the best part game tutorials  if really learn play chess like pro get game  however looking game use xbox live dont waste your time  i went xbox live play game else playing  the xbox population caught game enough spend money 
4,these games play exactly like original versions i used play old arcade days same graphics  sound effects  strategy  etc exact ports originals 
3,mad came searched pacman xbox thought would work compatable
2,these versions play like original games  i m amazed n t write emulator get games right 
3,this charm pretty clips onto charms well emerald green s bright grass green  i still like charm disappointed n t dark emerald green
2,i bought disc ray mcveigh guitarist  his playing professionals  i did n t see it coming  record incredible  the guitar tandem ray steve jones  sex pistols  record  far i m concerned  punk equivalent keith richards ron wood  tasteful  catchy  weaving guitar lines stuck head forever there none  like many industrial records  everything sludged effects  n t make style  there appearances artists i  problem exists there if need another industrial record  better filter  nonsense  s nothing s going change life 
3,part hide s charm free wheeling venture different styles rock music  here  american producers album seem targeted particular industrial explicit niche  losing lot lightness  humor  experimentation found hide s albums  the english lyrics doubt pose seem guitarist s mcveigh s setting standard western rock lyrics music n t sound right  the musicians excellent mix great  i n t find songs particularly memorable 
3,i bought i recently saw the philistines noticed ray mcveigh  outstanding guitarist  zilch sticker guitar  he produced plays cd the music   great sonic tracks driving guitars music takes chances  although frequently opts riff laden techno grooves  but singing i d rate  or less  i n t see fuss hide s singing  i found grating every track  lyrics puerile  almost always focused sex  gets little old  if i could wipe vocals track cd  i would  it would lot better 
4,all cute not so cute characters  lady  tramp  darlings  aunt sara  si  am  jock trusty  follow story line movie exactly  o k  but s  oh wow  factor pop ups pull tabs  this book made realize i loved movie  story  sweet voice lady wonderful lullabies  a well made book last many  many readings 
3,i received book time good shape  the book lots stories lead interesting climax climax never comes 
5,a great movie  fast  moving  totally capturing  it makes think  makes dance  makes heart beat faster  important makes realize important  second  lifetime change everything 
4,i mean  s bloody amazing  absolutely nothing film  yet somehow manages utterly compelling  almost entire film consists lola   running  indeed  less frenetic scenes really little get way  but part s pure action  works  and someone  rule  finds action films insufferably tedious  the direction indeed commended rarely letting  the soundtrack s perfectly done  someone  rule  violently dislikes industrial techno  i get impression anything done even slightly wrong  entire film would fallen apart  nothing is  really  as i said  really n t helluva lot substance  sure rush watch 
5,a well done ground hog day type movie  a well done movie  keeps interest way 
4,i first saw film film class college point i knew i  it probably n t best films  worth watch  i d go movie  i d giving much away 
2,although  run  lola  run  off beat  nice camera work impressive images  i could develop interest characters  lola s extreme red hair goofy outfit  blue tank top  white bra straps  turquoise pants  black doc martin boots things  distracting  the  driving music beat   however described   fairly boring repetitive the commentary slightly interesting movie  the two participants writer director tom lead actress franka couple time  accounts mutual admiration society feel commentary there may good idea movie  i could find  close least watchable movie   lost delirious     the smokers     black white    armageddon    i nearly dozed times i give movie two stars effort concept  i advise    run away  run  
5,this film made heart stop  i subconsciously held breath parts  fear disturbing incredible movement beauty  what innovative succession events  just think s  lola stuns  watch film alone  pay attention  the first experience key 
2,my year old daughter told film changed life  i m getting therapy soon  i suppose study film making techniques creativity film breaks novel ground  aside characters held interest  year old  the overdone running scenes comprise  rather short running film begin  decent dolby  effects  look something else 
2,i dont see bfd movie  i mean  yeah looks cool drugs  yay  i thought experimental    parts kinda cool  but i didnt like movie  i dont think connected groundhog day feeling together well  or obviously  this better othergroundhog dayin maybe hour shorter  not  and i usually like beat movies  just dont beat sake offbeat  i think i might check soundtrack though 
2,if like thumping  loud  monotonous music  may like film better i  with hungry  talented musicians world  i would think film maker could found could provide decent music although i liked potente films  difficult find characters interesting  maybe i could forgive lola love  boyfriend seemed worthless yes  film showed various futures could arisen single starting point  that good idea film  i think  spite attempts originality  result bear fruit  for intelligent film possibilities arising situation  i think rashomon would better way spend time 
2,i believe people would give film  stars  i forced watch entire film i could believe someone would actually recommend film  yea interesting twist  gets real painful  if love  god bless  
2,it kind interesting film  i found music boring monotonous  some good points technical merits originality  i could get past music  enjoyable  if director producer tin ears  millions cheap  underpaid musicians world  or leave obnoxious music out germany austria given much great music world  mahler  brahms  schumann  beethoven  haydn  mozart  handel  bach   it s shame movie germany could better the characters difficult identify  maybe intentional  it difficult understand lola cared worthless boyfriend i never rated movie low  worse films  it would decent movie taken ruin 
3,i think music kept movie moving  i see picture accompaniment soundtrack  they enchanche  i see movie reeeally long music video  do n t get dubbed version get subtitles  hear actors voices even dont know saying  this say movie virtues  it probably 
2,also finde toll  deutscher film usa gut ankommt  deutschland kino gesehen dachte  lange rennt    warum rennt schon   mein freundin fand film echt klasse  von vier leuten gibt  sterne   geben drei sterne gebe film  sterne  würde niemals dvd video kaufen 
3,run lola run achieved sort cult status since arrival germany  style alone  s easy see  fast paced  breakneck speed story  likeable  punk heroine  franka potente   cool animation  good soundtrack  on levels  run lola run works well  however  story another matter  i ve read several reviews praising different nuances  stylistically story wise  change story runs time  what i found crime story version film groundhog day  stylish version x files episode several years ago titled monday   mulder experienced botched bank robbery several times  run lola run definitely wins style points  points alone 
4,to beat incessant techno deephouse soundtrack  lola runs  runs  i could n t possibly think another movie sheer cinematic buzz  s cut like mtv video  blink may miss visual gag the theme doozy interesting  slicing reality time three perspectives  blending innovative mix animation  still photography  slow motion  normal cinematography  illustrates smallest change person alter rest life  mention lives others  including complete strangers pass street ironic  creative  simply riveting  fabulous kinetic pleasure rental  the breathless high octane soundtrack dance collections 
1,i know opinions subjective i undertsand could find interesting movie  the love story stereotyped  the boyfriend idiot  makes girl even idiot   soundtrack exhausting plot existing  in type movie much better done  please    
1,  what waste money   these words demonstrate exact reaction watching movie i regrettably purchased dvd  excited new dvd player  i bought dvd reading many great reviews movie  now i m extremely puzzled  why much praise flick  it anything interesting  story childish shallow much talked cinematography music nothing cheap attempts decorate silly plot  for buy movie  rent first  if fad driven kid actually thinks mtv music television jewel poet  ll surely dislike  there philosophical ideas  the mere fact movie considered  thought provoking  may testament reality perhaps thinking much 
1,i get  she running running running  no philosophical idea  no point  the movie telling us story three different versions  why  boring  
1,ok  know bad film like  yea well dnt watch cause fall asleep still know film running runninga running running get picture
1,this movie title makes much sense content  i gave star  although franka deserves five stars fitness 
5,the best film opinion  it made think  held spellbound  leaped screen  totally fresh  i disapointed nominated best foreign film academy motion picture arts sciences 
5,run neighborhood rental house rent  what wonderful contemporary film 
4,lola needs get hold deutschmarks boyfriend manni left bag money subway  light rail   if n t get minutes  rob store near phone booth called  the money belongs gangster kill manni n t get cash there three different scenarios lola s mad dash rescue boyfriend  it shows encounter people changed lives i liked different movie i ve seen  it got little far brief moments brushed people  but main parts story good well  great idea script  just needed little tweaking 
2,this reminds bit amelie  much better  amelie cutsie action  unfortunately  running get bit tiresome  though interesting much running time 
5,the thing upon i agree previous viewer character manni indeed bit annoying  bright  willing blame lola predicament  this film taught  however  hardly matters run lola run imaginative  mesmerizing  take your breath away exciting  the amazing visuals work perfectly outstanding soundtrack highly engaging storyline create truly exquisite film experience  highly  highly recommended 
3,i enjoyed theater  found another series look event several different ways   rashomon   style   like sliding doors go  film fun  it wears thin  though  along mtv type editing techniques 
4,i saw friday night soon bought dvd  the reviews give plot breakdown  i mention things i really like  filmed germany  west berlin  maybe  lots outdoor city locations  i viewed sub titled version  works great  a couple dialogue heavy scenes require reading  taxing  i thing things german  i like hearing language  also fine soundtrack film  techno pulsing  watch home theatre high quality audio system  it really adds experience imho  plus i enjoyed little  snapshot  stills twyker throws along way  very cool some negative reviewers say n t get film repetitive  just go along ride enjoy sights sound  in opinion real good way spend hour half  try  thanks reading sort disjointed review 
5,  run lola run  masterpiece unlike movie  movie traditional sense   s difficult follow first  on second later viewings  viewed marvel  it ingenious subtle nuances passing characters seemingly throwaway moments turn much  build suspense anticipation  well opprtunity brilliant twists  throughout movie  the pulsating sound track stroke genius  falls right step relentless pacing movie  if intolerant unusual innovative filmmaking  see movie  but genuine taste bizzare  creative  attention grabbing  deviously intelligent   run lola run  movie 
5,this best action movie i ve ever seen  i ve never big fan techno music  used effectively movie i found drawn soundtrack afterward  if appreciate cinematography like fast paced music video  absolutely love film  guaranteed 
5,this film best films i seen  many ways  n t describe  fast paced bored  the german language movie actually adds movie  would good english  this movie innovative   stars 
4,this movie could endedmin  instead repeats first  times  different outcomes  it shows little things life may affect bigger picture course s life  a bit philosophical movie  fast paced  lola run lot 
4,good movie  well paced  great music  but try watching cross groundhog s day x men  seriously  consider lola super hero time manipulation  sonic powers  banshee   healing powers lola super hero 
2,there many good things movie i really wish i could ve liked  but   felt like cinematic equivalent video game  if really spend minutes watching chick running i d suggest waiting next olympics  for german movie depth  rent anything fassbinder  herzog wenders 
2,i bought dvd movie i read positive feedback viewers  however  type movie i ll willing wait month viewing  as overseas buyer  movie  shipment waiting time  cost buying n t meet high expectation anticipation level movie  i expecting something like  le femme nikita  story  youngsters three different ending problems  the good thing movie   music  two thumbs music selection  
4,i liked  i n t overly snobish like many reviewers  i say  this entertaining movie ok plot gret music  there  i n t get psuedo intelligence like reviews 
3,  lola rennt  original title  and germany movie hit year  but film unreal scenes  example lola runs around corner  returnes street  km corner  but i like movie great scenes brilliant soundtrack makes lola run even faster 
3,really  it s hour long  it s said  rlr fast  creative interesting  i m glad short though  had longer i probably would gotten bored  wise choice 
5,i usually n t like foreign films great  this fast paced  high energy film  interesting plot  surprise endings   side note  it s nice see germany everyday person s perspective travel brochure  
5,it good  it good  next i watch  still good  it s go back hour two change events time run 
5,the people already summed quite well  i must chime anyhow  i went see movie theater twice  first time i ever done any movie   needles say i loved awaiting dvd release buy this movie you will love to watch it again and again do n t let german language version scare subtitles easy read makes feel running berlin       
3,this movie purely amazing  the plot wonderful  acting superb soundtrack fantastic  not  film used perfect mix blak white film wicked   highly recommend movie anyone wants real intensity really good acting point seems like movie  prepare blown away    
5,very inventive movie reminds kieslowski  without catholic baggage  see randmom life isand small encounters slight changes timing significantly alter s life others  without even aware  this interesting  new  idea think  yet cleverly presented aesthetically pleasing manner film  this movie elements classic cult film 
5,i really liked movie  visually  beautiful movie  the characters  even minor ones  intriguing  the plot exciting revolutionary  and finally  soundtrack wicked awesome franka potente amazing actress  evidence bourne identity  she lots charisma pulls movie  manni actually n t bad  he lola pretty weird people ok applause germans  ve really good  sehr gut 
5,this best movies i ve ever seen  it fast paced interesting  oh god  absolutely see   
5,this brilliant film  lola played franke potente red haired  natural know i mean  freaky type gets call boyfriend manny frantic telling lost bag money taking renni bald headed cimminal type  he states minutes get money renni dead  lola tells stay rushes home find  deustch marks  anyway clever story takes place real time  so may thinking movie takes place real time last minutes  hmmm  see film  the highest recommendation  i would watch w o subtitles first watch subtitles  german film  plus stars no need watch buy  it easily worth money
5,run lola run would time favourite movies  it innovative  original movies i ever across  i could never really tolerate euro techno i rented dvd  the music composed talented director writer tom tywker performed leading lady  on screen  franka potente  brilliant charismatic lola  the story simple  lola minutes tomake loot lost hapless boyfriend manni manni killed  there three alternatives story  detailing s actions could consequences others cross path  many compared what if flicks  sliding doors   but film benefits terribly self conscious gwyneth paltrow another bad attempt british accent the movie fast  euroccentric  would n t believe d staring screen minutes  more exciting soccer match 
1,i see lot glowing reviews movie i n t get  it s  deep   ingenious  brilliant  anything else i ve heard called  anyone thinks movie thought provoking probably thinks barney dinosaur great philospher  seriously  get education   this gimmicky  kitchy film combination concepts used  the funny part n t great concepts first time i saw films  but hey  nothing suceeds like excess   lets bring together make really really bad movie 
1,this movie n t even deserve star  the script horribly written  kept playing same thing  little parts changed replayed  i knew i could n t stand watch another rerun  i watch movie german i m certainly watching 
4,i believe movie well premise movie the premise point background ie music  running  fates lie endings     that said i seen movie since theaters  i may ambiguous  therefore may best review  i open critiques i like movie  reccomend anyone mood something different   
3,this movie overrated people might found movie s concept really really cool  i think movie n t provide much beside original     daring  screenplay  sure  nice watch lola running movie i higher expectations  i glad director looking happy perfect ending otherwise lola would running eternity 
3,this movie explores variations affect day  most time  small changes would n t mean much  but  life line  small change profound impact following decisions  events  coincidents  this movie brave enough show  taking page rashomon  shows events  different perspectives however  movie lost caring characters  the boyfriend whose life line gangster  dealer  why would i lives  so poison youth later  overall  dvd average  there s many extras   sided dvd widescreen full screen versions  like miss  movie   this movie may worth watch  much 
1,i give film  stars  this the princess warrior top time favorites this less review advice may influenced star reviews  the reviewers tried really hard sound intelligent time admitting  n t get  claim nothing thought provoking they say thing three times showing three possible results  these reviewers said themselves n t get it during movie song what difference day makes played create atmosphere send message  one main points movie show difference precious seconds make cheers p s hopefully sheds light star reviewers well  i doubt 
4,people actually think throughout course day need buy movie  s fantastic  n t much drones zombies live lives without ever developing insight anything  it s interesting entertaining time  leaves consider time plays big role lives encounters w people  if n t buy rent b c get thinking 
5,i borrowed movie friend kill time work though explain plot  i still loved  what told n t exactly tell expect  espeically well music cordniated film  the speical features include great video  lead actress s song  the features n t interest i n t check  if liked books choose outcome like go page   ll love movie  i intially watched english dub audio lips totally voices sounded weird  i watched german english subtitles  i n t mind subtitles  i enjoy forgein films  like  buying dvd would great addition 
4,although german dvd change languages english  the base story lola s boyfriend must get whole lot money minutes  how    well thats whole plot it starts wild cartoon turns  real life  movie  the movie non stop whirl win fun  the excitment action  explosives  great i movie although dont watch time i find going back watching whenever see good action excitement movie  it good plot way movie put together new vibrant  the music supports film well also i would recommend movie anyone likes talk stuff doesnt dream lola journey never really would 
5,i dont think i actually say enough movie tell fantastic perfectly grand watch  i think customer reviews average  star rating says  i bought movie basis friends reviews  movie top ten list best movies i seen  the cinematography  plot  music  actors   all excellent  i could n t find single flaw even  done    this good miss 
1,well whats like title track  the    version keeps bit intro still cuts outro  deeper underground  chillington mix  tries darker sort industrial sound sounds pretty mushy terrible  vocals fit bit music overall though songs  sure get jewel case version cardboard slipcase trays get annoying damaged easy easier cd songs rather   
1,you probably read towards bottom description works xp  ll even read back of the package  s true  compaq still drivers xp recognize pa   xp d better get different mp player 
3,the ipaq pa  reliable player use windows media player  it downloads wma format  mp format work  this fact  read compaq web site   in wma format music plays well  downloads slow software self explanitory  otherwise good product  not recommended hurry download music  i suggest buyingk flash cards

2,it works sony dsc s8 camera  sony camcorder  it gives format error  i m sure difference works fine camera  if i would known would work camera  i would purchased sony stick 
2,there many memory cards market  i think list camera brands models available product description easier find convenient looking  asking products choices specific brand cameras presented results r limon
5,i purchased product generic alternative expensive sony original  the two memory sticks similar may well manufacturer  i detect absolutely difference performance two the sony memory stick format useful somewhat overpriced  real pleasure find reasonable alternative  strongly recommended
2,i looking book little enlightened little less materialistic  this author clearly likes shop  i shopper   hard relate  most ideas i read  i think title little misleading  when i think meaning  i think higher ideals  time read book quiet corner house  i n t know   i think strong sense brings meaning  might find book bit superficial  writing good good quotes 
3,i found book quite helpful  however  details missed  also  concern i overwhelming push toward vanguard  i appreciate enthusiasm vanguard  i contacted vanguard setup account  customer service delayed  unresponsive disinterested i chose business  i found shock considering much tyson raves vanguard

4,this cd touch sampler   yet released  this touch sampler  released commemorate millenium  it s nice cd  track listing right  product title incorrect  see    
4,i n t imagine limiting instrument music box  tones set specific pattern  n t deviate  but colleen somehow makes music boxes magical  by mixing traditional plucked sounds re processed synthesized counterparts  manages evoke fairy mysticism   what s componium  part  goes thick sonics singular tones  and even  charles s birthday card  relies solely iterations pop goes weasel   will you gamelan for me   creation immediately  the tinkling comes fast furious  what s componium  part     track sparkles like moondust   calypso box  shows processed side  almost senor coconut feel short running time  the standout piece final track   i ll read you story   appeared earlier album  always welcome anywhere 
5,all original hits songs this collection gathered together two separate music disc s slipped cardboard sleeve  the titles are  absolutely best sixties  the psychedelic sixtiesthese two complete artwork disc s  great way get titles n t already  i already careful 
3,this movie interesting altman directed  it okay 
2,altman moments  early career  moments came often   m a s h    the long goodbye     nashville    mccabe  mrs  miller   but disasters disappointments  this lackluster  tedious picture belongs latter folder  there utter lack narrative momentum  carradine duvall real bore  use radio bits fails add much  no needs see movie 
5,keith carradine bowie shelly duvall keechie inhabit mouldering hamletss south naturally unaffectedly throat tightens  this softer  dreamier bonnie  clyde type  filmed nicholas ray  they live by night   stands   the long goodbye  pinnacle robert altman s extraordinarys body work  even  mccabe  mrs miller     nashville   shot like old sepia photographs jean boffety  film boasts extraordinary supporting work bert remsen  john shuck  pre   cuckoo s nest  louise fletcher  unforgettable little girl  why masterpiece forgotten baffling  s royal line american movies dealing average women trying live twilight decency crime 
3,whilst superbly laid reference select knots   unfortunately live s title  recommended novices  clubs schools etc serious knotter like eagerly lifted shelf find yet another rehash items   nonetheless well produced illustrated  good s class  well done  peter 
2,its full pitures i thought would  there better books i would pass i known 
5,this book grabs attention beginning holds ending  a must read adventure life  death struggle early americans faced late s soil  we anxiously awaiting roy hays  next book  the kentucky scout series   
4,the book recounts harrowing adventure  ultimately fearless nature people indefatigable fight back survive shines  without doubt arousing heroic age pioneer exploration 
2,the bra  molded  taste  the cups thick feel breast way helmet feels head  it good basic design i returning uncomfortable density cups 
2,i le mystere safari t shirt bra love  bra good  the quality great  fabric harsh cups bra stiff  when i tried  bra separated boobs far apart  it made look like s housewife cone boobs  no cleavage  total separation  pointy  just attractive as sizing  i n t feel cups small  i g le mystere bras fit proportional  the cups made chest look unattractive 
3,i ordered  le mystere bra s i ddd  one fit well seemed small i hanging top sides  i return  i would order  sizes 
2,the elastic used band easily loses s elasticity thus loses shape quickly  wear i noticed difference   for molded style  bra loses s use week  it s pretty poorly engineered 
4,i bought bra month ago using daily wear far i m happy fit comfort  it gives great shape lift petite bust c  without  push  effect  this first mystere bra  i compare models brand compared brands i ve used far i believe brand worth popularity  in terms sizing  i think true size terms band cups  least   and fit  it lifts well comfortable enough day wear  the bra convertible straps worn criss cross removed  the straps kinda decorated  wide  this may provide comfort larger cups i personally prefer thinner spaghetti strapped bras find convenient wear tank tops  overall i like bra would consider buying bras brand model 
1,i n t thrilled fit bra  it stiff edges pronounced even thickest sweater could n t hide 
3,this game really fun n t easy like rugrat s games played  the thing irritates hell collecting hidden funny money unlock special mini games  there s area game tons funny money impossible get  but overall s fun game especially rugrat s fan 
5,i wanted say i bought rugrats game playstation  yr old  although i played  enjoys i family room watch play  i must say  every time i glance tv playing new adventure  he hooked say least  he likes real rugrats nickelodeon characters i like obnoxiously violent like games  two thumbs parent 
2,maybe i n t give game chance  i could n t i would get motion sick quickly  maybe s bright colors high pitched music constantly going around circles  i hanging side tv  turning green within minutes every time i tried play  i baby easy level   i n t find easy  i m kid  no doubt s probably lot fun later get vehicles stuff  i could n t even put together snowman beginning levels  to credit  baby easy level let win even skills horrible i huge failure far navigating river  game still applauded advanced next level   and still i could n t put together snowman  i loser  
2,the accuracy rule ruggedness construction seem satisfactory  unfortunately lock mechanism n t work well  rule moves pushed even rule locked tightly  i tighten lock enough keep rule moving forcefully pressured 
4,when i bought square i considered disposable unit would probably get bent broken stolen within short order  after checking starrett mitutoyo squares i surprised find accurate  surprisingly  pretty durable  while i big fan zinc heads consumer grade squares  well made  accurately machined far  durable  the etched painted blade easy read although easy starrett mitutoyo  satin chrome   granted  buy  squares price starrett mitutoyo units while i would never consider replacing    mitutoyo square i hesitate run buy another  two three swanson squares current finally get bent disappears overall  i would give square five stars value four stars quality 
1,if like crappy motivational films make employees feel like brainwashed watch videos present ride the high places need  you ashamed crap inspired anything life  useless video garbage  thumbs 
5,brenda lee little dynamite voice used visit australia packed houses best early rock nroll artists girls c d  hits extras pity doesnt still perform sure would still pack house wherever performed another great record amazon well played collection  jack darby australia

2,when i bought book i hoping getting book covering small jets  but i got book including lot piston aircraft airliners along jets  piston engine n t jet engine  some informations i would like know  jets  e g  cruising  but book s good sides  the recognition part neat i thing gives book two stars 
1,i ll make short  terrible script forgettable acting  how d liam nieson  extremely cheesy  mention lame  visual effects  it seemed skimped screen writer waste money worthless effects  very boring sound effects  s many times i creaky  i put mute  at least rental  however  late cost  bucks  waste  i m glad i n t blindly pay 
2,this movie n t scare  barely entertains frustrating watch capable actors  zita jones nelson  limited roles the script plan bad  instead showing realistic traditional ghost producer decided go high dollar unrealistic special effects way overdone i n t hate movie  i really disapointed 
2,the haunting incredibly mediocre  even point making laugh screaming  the plot weak  script empty  acting subdued  well  expect movie zeta jones  actually  scariest part movie n t allow good actor played bit part  bruce dern  main character film  trust  ve seen movie hundred times  even the house on haunted hill better turkey 
2,not scary  bad acting  boring story   one star added nifty special effects  i really wanted like movie  alas  another  armageddon   
2,do computer generated things scare  they n t scare me do sets scare  they n t scare either i understand studios n t make money re releasing old classics theatres home video spend money trying remake even surpass something obviously sum human parts  n t n t reuse  is n t like trying first moon    again  some scriptwriters directors could make biscuit glass milk frightening they used super computer called talent please reboot 
4,many people seen movie  many n t like  i  hand  thought alright  one complaint i ve heard film like many remakes  n t like original   hmm   think maybe s it s not the original  in order truly like remake  look past fact probably gon even close original  however  seems anytime disney remakes something like hercules mighty joe young  get praised even though remakes way original context  this movie n t bad  it n t scary  still bad  i found story horror film 
3,i really liked idea story  especially catherine zeta jone s part  pleased lack demension  the story flat  to  real opening  middle  ending  everything blended  moved quickly 
4,i thought great movie  fine  story average  fantastic effects even better sound made  i would recommend film anyone dolby digital setup  back feel room shake 
3,i think blair witch project released time  i could wrong   if i pick i d watch would withoout doubt  and s  first least  real  actors  i must admit i n t mind seeing catherine zeta jones movie  the story sorta fun  i must admit might think what is this  but entertaining  the setting good house used fit mood quite well  as effects over done know i mean  it looked fake  but n t expect greatness movie  they do n t make movies like they use to 
1,when i first saw preveiw movie looked intriguingly scary  but changed i actually saw  i found boring  i actully waiting get scared  the preveiw movie scarier also  storyline exceptionally weak nearly drowned way many special effects this movie another  tech show   
1,wan scared  watch movie  horrible  more words would waste 
2,i watched flick a m  afterwards  i trouble falling asleep  when hollywood going realize showing much emphasis visuals makes bad theater  overdone  bombastic  predictable  cgi effects  the house looked much like gaudy museum ridiculous fixtures  on positive side  though  sound effects great  the bass notes well done  subtle shades ghostly children whispering eerie creaky sounds throughout house real jewel film 
2,in the haunting group people told would paid stay haunting hill night skeptic prove point nothing fear  it n t long attacks  such stairs person collapses story  mysterious oversized hand reaches tries grab occupants  this movie starts well s scary like s supposed unique  quickly notice s repetative 
2,unlike smart creepy original  title  spine tingling shirley jackson novel  titled  the haunting hill house    jan de bont s brainless thriller  the haunting  beats mercilessly head great special effects  leaves wondering story logic went  the film s razzle dazzle visuals make somewhat fun  s unescapably downer 
2,the originial of this movie was much better  the special effects in this remake are better but the plot is nothing like the original 
4,not much scary interesting  however decent performances keep involved  the story little  could much better  opposed  run time worth seeing never less 
2,four people placed gigantic mansion part study fear  n t realize house actually haunted  effects heavy thriller features decent beginning so so cast  liam neeson catherine zeta jones fine  owen wilson lili taylor spectacularly awful   eventually falls apart last half hour  barrage cheesy special effects taking  add predictability sappy conclusion movie went promising big dud  it might  however  hold appeal non horror fans looking quick  undisturbing thrills  seems crowd movie aimed   for everyone else  either stick original see house haunted hill real coaster ride haunted house thriller  which actually features better cgi effects  surprise considering  budget the haunting  
1,only  age mediocrity  could piece rubbish like get made  owen wilson turns worst performances recent memory  this made strictly idiots find mtv worthwhile part culture 
1,question  how excellent cast  millions dollars  top line fx  base good movie toturn piece unwatchable garbage  answer  let jan bont direct 
4,this movie first movies i watched dvd i read novel  the haunting hill house   that said  i found movie interesting beginning  slow middle action packed end the setting beautiful house great gothic look  maybe house overshadowed characters  the movie centered around nervous character finding really defeating bad guy  the actors innocent by standers movie hurt film i gave four stars zeta jones setting  this terrible movie  could much 
1,a truly horrible horror film  over use special  special effects  attempted divert attention fact movie never gained momentum  characters never developed interesting  the thing s scary film someone actually tried improve upon classic horror movie frightening memory still scares years  the thing scares movie reoccurring memory i actually paid see 
4,this great b  movie there real comparison first    that intellectual haunted house story  this juvenile the idea dudleys  wife caretakers  could forty acre lawn well monstrous castle struck hilarious   no town  says after catastrophic damage house  i really felt dudleys the picture fun 
1,it s really difficult make good movie bad material  but making bad movie good material must easy   jan debont proves turkey  shirley jackson s story spooky classic  robert wise s b  w version excellent scariest movies i ve ever seen  and he without special effects  sound  shadows  camera angles  this movie could much better relying original premise forgetting comic book special effects  mr debont proving s better technician director  liam neeson must lost bet go along 
2,i really stoked watch movie  and i honestly enjoyed first half  setup  i love actors  the look feel picture great  dug vibe  a bunch strangers together insomnia experiment haunted house new england  the dr  liam neeson n t told wants study reaction fear  they stay house couple days begins effect  lili taylor s charactor particular that s far i go w o spoilage  i ll say becomes predictable haunted house story  i n t get thrills i expecting  such interesting characters  such potential  i ve rarely seen movie let 
2,hollywood reheats classic  cheap serving hardly appetizing  this remake throws heavy morsels cgi throat give indigestion same basic story  people volunteer stay extravagant mansion  this time n t told house s dark past  they believe part study insomnia  the truth part controlled experiment group fear now i thought nice alteration story  but unfortunately starts get extremely ridiculous  nothing subtle  plenty cheap scares  like ghostly images moving statues  as turns house basically holding cell dead children s souls  the evil landlord s spirit keeps watch purgatory  great  perverted pedaphile ghost this turns goofy adventure flick  no spooky atmosphere mystery  no suspense  no reason bother 
1,this travesty  shirley jackson s creepy  intelligent  incomparable  the haunting hill house   original  the haunting   it s ghost story video game addicted morons  i ve lost respect i may neeson  zeta jones taylor  this permanent blotch resumes  if smart   might consider whiting  i n t apologize sounding spiteful  either  century s best ghost  stories turned excuse lots gimmicky  asinine computer graphics  instead crafted eerie filmed masterpiece deserved  i angered even disgusted hollywood  crummy formulas lowest common denominator scriptwriting i ever 
2,this re make fails evoke true terror  trading easier shocks thanks easily distinguished cgi effects  might worked original idea  re make classic movie  based classic novel  necessitates living original  movie 
1,i ll admit years ago i seen part movie remake so bad  so corny  so awfully un scary i could n t even continue punish barely made half way  i  lover things spooky    i recall however three things movie  directing awful  script terrible cathy jones  i n t know  n t married old yet really launched career  gave performance particularly producing worst things movie  no  i speak haste  number worst  things movie if creeped out  read book  the haunting hill house shirley jackson   if must see story movie form  watch old black white original starring julie harris  it s dark moody may give shiver two along tinge vertigo happy hauntingness  wind hare
1,1  this rare movies s lame  i n t  could n t finish it   this movie lame  spending time writing detailed review waste time 
3,this movie started good  the sound great actually scared couple times  but towards oppurtunity wrap good ending  ended using many special effects  the acting ok script tried spoon feed plot much  the color  sound  picture quality good dvd like watching  clear  movies would good choice 
2,okay  movie may nominated oscar best movie  best acting  even fx  however  good movie spend minutes  the critics listed harsh  i almost buy movie  i glad i  watch times  zeta jones pretty girl  nice outfits movie  the haunted hause nicely decorated  watch times  please keep mind  sometimes movies good pass time  
3,not bad movie great either  from entertainment stand point good  as remakes old horror moives good script hard find  it old movie unfortunately copied many times  takes away story  but whole good movie  there enough creepy scenes make cut average fright flick 
1,along new starwars  it movies  bucks  hours life back afterwards  the plot lame  the psycho thriller classic turns flop  dumb special effects fest  i recommend  matrix    taxi driver  remastered   etc  holiday viewing 
3,the haunting suspenceful movie  great sets special effects  i really movie untill found related ghosts  and put worst line ever movie  family laughed year  whoever wrote line  it s it s family  well i m family too grandpa      extermely imbarsed  from line movie terrible stupid  so see scary movie good special effects see haunting  laugh worst line ever see 
4,give new home theatre setup new subwoofera great workout  dvd s get  preferably dtsif  plot pretty ordinary  acting even  soundtrack  great   stars soundtrack 
2,some day lili taylor land role film show world high calibre actress really  the haunting film  what thankless part ms lili  what thankless film  the scariest thing movie must bill c g i  effects studio received  i mean  movie moment two tension  whole  i bored there nothing new  fury evil  dead capitalist pain inflicted mostly children workers  family  n t seem get house  so  the evil live  how original  i m reaching sarcasm never pretty  i  this movie pits 
1,crass  vulgar  ridiculous farce film regrettably retains none keen psychological portraits jackson s novel  believe  i stickler slavish literary adaptations  when changes need made cinematic purposes  i utterly support director s choice  here  however  jackson s work even display spirit  instead  juvenile  special effects laden mess marred juvenile screenplay lousy performances good actors  even liam neeson publicly declared utter disgust production  if filmmakers taken robert wise film version inspiration  means faultless masterpiece compared dreck  only folks adore cgi appreciate film  i say  enjoy   to looking characters true chills  try  the innocents     the changeling     the legend hell house   original  the haunting  instead 
2,all i can say is see the original with julie harris  so much better than the new  the new depends on computer effects  which were pretty cool  but did not save the movie from its downfall  its lack of story was lame not scary what so ever  see the original  you wont be dissapointed 
1,i honestly n t understand zeta jones  badly scripted part stealing show reviewers  cliched  liberated woman hint vulnerability  part highlight rest awful movie  bitter  i  whens version movie scaress version  afraid 
2,it funny  bad acting  stupid scripts top special effects  there nothing else laugh stupid  this movie good hour shorter n t repeated scences looking house outside  and  catherine zeta jones n t save movie 
2,this horror movie interesting science fiction movie  however  science fiction movie bad special effects bad dialogue  the acting good  n t make  i n t buy movie i went see theatre  enough  if real horror movie  check the sixth sense 
5,catherine zeta jones owen wilson star creepy thriller  this scary story haunted house wont rest  its like house haunted hill house locks  trying scare death reside  watch movie 
4,if like super natural mysteries  d like film  it technically horror film  s really frightening  though scene movie made mother jump three feet   result  people watch horror films fright  as mystery  however  really quite good  deserves watched  find hidden clues answer 
4,this  course  much like orginal  i still think better   good effects decent story  i  i bought original first  this hollywood story  the original believable  watch 
3,i ll agree everyone movie n t really faithfull novel would fared better relied subtle approach good scare  like version sixth sense  instead special effects exravaganza folks let s  summer  movie summer movies mean thing   mondo special effects  huge budgets big sound  i lover types movies summer movies noise cgi american tradition like baseball apple pie enjoy stop complaining  let s save intellectual films winter spring months  bring popcorn  ca n t wait the haunting dvd 
2,i thought movie would something  teaser trailer far better movie  i understood n t jump horror movie  psychological thriller thing  still  good  maybe thing good catherine zeta jones neat merry go round  mirror room  special effects  i found characters movie quiet boring  plot confused third time i watched  but like slow paced movies eventually  
2,no    what went wrong  big budget film great actors  get  a visually appealing film completely flat liam neeson paper thin storyline  catherine zeta jones tries charm way  even though okay job  movie still bad  lili taylor owen wilson try add flavour  manage save day  all get movie novelties way little content  it seems really begins  nothing really makes much sense  and eerie mood almost totally absent  not good omen  horror  movie   i n t believe went wrong neeson  usually drags movie   watch house haunted hill instead  re  stuff some people into a haunted house and see if the survive  movies  then ll proper haunting  
4,this movie potential movie i ve ever seen  however  somewhere  someone messed  i like movie  however  it offers creepy escape friday night final verdict  worth look  willing accept fun creepy movie 
3,if watch movies home theater system effects thunder subwoofer  movie rocks  if  still watch movies entertained  kinda disappointed movie  it deepest bass extension lfe section soundtrack i ever encountered system  however  best part movie  the sound effects  awesome  the movie   oh yeah   movie  it ok  nothing  but effects make worth buy dolby digital system 
2,this probably worst  horror  movie i ever seen  do n t see unless bored death 
2,if movie played cheep thrills  could good  it array good  overly impressive  actors  good special effects  good basis novel  unfortunately  acting skips around histrionics casual acceptance histrionics plain silliness  this neat movie watch brainless eye candy  really lost lot energy translation big screen video and completely unrelated  ending scene sounds like anti russian lobbyist   i n t let kill children  ukraine  go hell   
3,one best actors contemporary films lili taylor  she element film make worth viewing  everyone likeable  screeplay s potential  house s secret  never climbed level suspense  the ghostly manifestations scream  computer  works creation eerie atmosphere  the excellent eerie moment lili taylor looking reflection mirror  one thing amazed  apart screenplay  attracted i lili taylor i never previously regarded way  catharine zita jones played sexy character   money  lili taylor far appealing personality physical look 
2,the special effects thing saved movie  the characters shallow  plot either non existant predictable  ending unbelievable  if re interested movie  i would recommend version instead  it n t rely heavily special effects turn great characterization plot  mention believable setting   the dvd takes longer usual cue n t work players   i tried two different discs  problem  
2,sad sad sadthe waste talent movie sad state affairs  catherine zeta jones much higher caliber actress  along liam neeson s lame attempts make movie palatable crime    almost movies  set haunted  the beginning movie much promise  feel backround centralized story promise  get suckered premise house offer   without warning  silliness begins it ve thrown addams family reunion  story line starts wander  characters continue wander  ideas solutions pop up without warning explanation   to say  horror  movie n t believable almost sounds absurd  movie gets suckered  throws floor flat   this definite  buy  borrow rent  just wait cable 
2,the newly updated film version shirley jackson s  the haunting hill house  somewhat acceptable  if looking good effects strong character lead   the haunting  cup tea  for rest us something scary   the haunting  definitely  for first hour movie  s creepy fun explore house along actors  but second half begins roll   the haunting  loses steam  if person enjoys sights sounds high budget film  buy  the haunting   but class horror flicks  definitely leave collection 
1,the movie takes so long to get interesting your asleep beforeyou know it thank god i rented this 
4,i saw original movie good  that really rare  most re made versions arent good  i liked actors special effects great  i first on line buy movie comes  dont hesitate see movie  well original course 
2,this another movies mostly s special effects support  do n t get wrong catherin zeta jones hot usual needed bigger role  this movie good many ways horror like maybe adventure would suited fine horror  as matter fact i would like opportunity say movie least scariest i ever seen still good storyline goes behind  so yes movie would worth renting 
1,no  s good original  but let s rate s merit  hmmm  none  this movie sucks whether compare original let try stand alone  one worst movies recent years  ridiculous acting  except liam neeson  s like s good  i n t know  stupidest plots i ever seen life  this waste  n t buy  n t rent  this terrible movie  period 
1,movies n t get much worse  folks  the plot poor acting terrible  the scene near beginning two ladies prancing around house incredibly lame  the filmmakers tried overcome shoddy storyline tossing mediocre special effects  if intended distraction  n t work i admit  review based first minutes movie  that i could i got couch  rewound film  promptly returned video store 
5,this good movie star packed cast  with many twists turns never know going happen next  love it
3,this movie allright  best  it loosely based  the haunting  wich came earlys  i think   the original alot better  it  this  starts similar original  changes  it adds childrens  ghosts things  though i think might made similar book find movie  the hell purgatory   it n t neat  dizzying  camera angles first  instead adds alot special affects  wich i give credit good job  credit   but compared first    it really good scary  if see good scary movie  see original  the haunting   or  innocents   wich scary    the changeling   leave shelf  save money get real  scary horror movie  ones i mentioned 
1,if movie poor script  poor acting  poor scares movie  we hoping scary movie  instead came across comedy  lili taylor horrible eleanor  woman driven save everyone else deserved deciding attempt production  liam neeson  thinking 
1,not scary  original  bad computer fx  bad acting suspense  what waste money  
4,i liked movie  realy good special effects good story line  mildly scary nearly scary thought would  parts predictable  i think could made little better  entertaining definatley worth seeing 
3,this great premise update version movie make big budget special effects  it works great looking mansion special effects truly scary parts levels fails  mainly cast good cast liam neeson cathrine zeta jones lilly taylor wasted characters begining sent town never hear  directed by jan bont famous speed could truly scary exciting  but partly scary exciting  but reccomend special effects production design 
1,i guess part i liked best eleanor discovered related ghost haunting house  it really believable  tears came eyes touching  then  cherubs wall came life  i even moved little souls finally freed go heaven  that really touching  i amazed screenwriter s brilliance  and special effects  he clever add  it must taken great deal intelligence everything  even ceilings alive  i feel richer human investing time masterpiece 
1,movie stupid  waste anybody s money time  not even catherine zeta jones make seem worth watching  parts movie scary  in fact  comedy mistake 
1,it n t work  astounding sets alone n t create on screen chemistry  the story line performances weak   even worse  i n t think scary   n t whole idea  i left theatre feeling cheated  this movie plain dumb 
4,if like low sound  i really mean low  subwoofer  buy  you impress friends seeing movie midnight  this dvd real n t sleep watching 
2,the actors movie great bunch  plot weak  dont get much  i mean liam neeson  hes great actor  weak movie  wasnt scary  movie bad  there maybe scary part  fake lookin skeleton popped made jump  that  i dont recommend movie people like scary movies  b c polar opposite 
1,a fan jackson s novel robert wise adadptation  i went movie expecting underwhelming  it worse  in fact  bad  i laughed way  along two friends accompanied   there many digital effects house seems alive  indeed  computer geeks set free big budget n t creep  they re annoying  so movie  the house shape shifts  sighs  moans  hell  even door knocker gets reaction shot  zeta jones s leather hipboots manage out act  lili taylor hilariously bad eleanor    i ve got save children   wha   liam neeson even less interesting the phantom menace  s possible  let s put way  i sacrificed minutes time write review n t waste hour minutes film 
2,this horrible movies ve ever seen  it starts promising creepy house old story house haunted  from gets worse worse worse ending  might dumbest ending ve ever  this movie deserves star catherin zeta jones looked attractive movie  like always  give extra star her p s what s micheal douglas  s shame 
1,how sane  intelligent person  perhaps explains   could recommend overblown crap fest beyond  quite posibbly worst horror movie ever made  get original version read classic novel  but  do not waste your time or money on this train wreck of a movie 
1,i m sorry  i could n t stay awake see complete video  whenever cliche  scare comes  i fall asleep   and often  i saw original s version  sorry  snoozer  i think story could phenomenally scary  right party yet make it the really scary thing movie looking like lily taylor share screen catherine zeta jones  she s goddess  
1,third grade mentality  third rate dialog  not adults  egads  i actually bought dvd  shame 
1,good cast  high budget movie  the movie supposed concentrate group  people  insomniacs  going stay isolated house  test reactions pressure situations was lack direction  lack story line  lack interest actors led movie become flop  watching movie chore  it exciting  the avengers   there s lot said  apart save money get better movie  the sixth sense made cheaper budget  far exciting  
1,  the haunting  certainly worst films i ve seen  while starts promisingly  sets special effects become mind numbingly overdone thread original story lost completely  it replaced story derivitive banal  laugably contrived well  this movie proves even classic novel classic movie  remake totally botch rendering beyond recognition  recommended film audience prefers style far substance 
2,  the haunting  julie harris good  even better black white medium  enhances sense macabre general off kilterness set  why n t remake  the wizard of oz   now  s picture could made much pertier modern cinematography  the cheap set old theatre style acting throw damper s still great universal story 
3,this film recycles every haunted house cliche black and white movie  tone movie often veers camp  especially lili taylor s performance   the back story muddied incoherent  it s shame large budget special effects many talented actors  the haunting n t generate thrills audience 
1,the thing  horror  film made house lili taylor  catherine zeta jones  looking good   story forced  never caught horror  special effects cartoon like  bit frighting  original movie short story scare pants    mind conger horror  minds eye dark corners fear  oh  another thing ruined movie  owen wilson  n t stand   ever got movies beyond   ignore cluttered movie go original black white get set terrified 
1,to say i disappointed movie would understatement  to classify horror film would plain wrong  while achieves goal tell good story  chills thrills n t  i recommend movie anyone serious yen scared wits  if real frightening  i recomend rose red  that s haunted house story told 
1,it s bad  i ve already written review i feel duty make everyone avoid hideous vile mess costs  rent original 
2,what made book horrorific good special effects thoughts feelings main characters the ending completely destroyed  the writers director producer stuck closer original story would much better movie  classic c est vie 
1,this stupidist movie i ever seen  the acting horrible besides catherine zeta jones  excellent   but i mean girl dull  word comes mind i think movie lifeless  cant producers waste million movie eerie scary  opinion horrible 
4,do n t form opinion merely hollywood tells n t like  at least remake  s believable reason house haunted instead    original  this scary i first watched enough suspense without gore  granted  n t scary second time around  i ve enjoyed enough watch 
3,this movie o k  the first time i saw movie theater  it scary  i could n t believe pg movie could actually scary  but movie going beginning  cool special effects   favorite part  and owen wilson favorite character  he made funny  overall  i say movie good script plot could little better 
1,this movie  supposedly journey terror  lulls sleep time  the pace slow i thought exposition would never  there n t fear producing moment entire movie  i believe  bambi  scarier this movie dreadful  especially remembers version julie harris  i wonder much money spent making dud 
1,to sum movie takes word word   terrible  if first foray the haunting stop go back years original 
1,this worst movies i ever seen  it absolutly stupid  boring  time waster  the movie seemed forever i could n t wait  plus  ending absolutely terrible stupid  the main character story bizzare character really could n t relate  the characters pretty weird  funny  the special effects ok  really annoyed stupid statues kept coming life make movie go  there many many comedy aspects movie hard tell sometimes whether comedy horror movie  fact characters problems obvious   i n t know old version movie  new really sucks 
1,i saw commercial movie  the special effects looked great  i expecting see great action packed movie  a friend i anxiously stepped theater  the movie started little action  gone  nothing  that  i actually fell asleep  something i never  this stupidest movies i ever seen life  it n t even deserve star  i ve got give something  if think looks like good deal  think  your money worth something much better price 
2,my review simple  bad  watch movie might find boring bit i dont recommend people enjoy movies good story directing 
2,this overdone remake brilliant classic sorely disappointing  if released original movie original title  would worked  the special effects  though good  much movie 
1,this horride movie  it creepy sceans  story flater paper  this proves movie n t need special effects scary  i saw  the sixth sense  much better  and scary  movie  do n t waste money 
2,this bad remake really original scary movie  this remake focuses children trapped house  the original movie focused house scary evil  that made scary  the haunting remake ok special effects needed  whoever reads review i n t really recommend movie waste couple bucks go ahead 
3,this movie  somewhat  based shirley jackson horror story the haunting hill house  if ve read loved novel  need skip watching movie  jackson able scare readers words  she n t rely tricks i loved book  this movie ok spooky film  n t close jackson s work 
2,this horror film based original  the haunting   creepy ways  altogether  s really great film  it good acting  scares pop outs clever  things boost rating    ending n t perfect  really hold movie completely falling apart  the film moves slow beginning  starts pick pace soon  later s intense ending  the film ok ways  ultimately becomes fail win  still n t horrible  i liked house setting  though  that cool  the complete storyline pretty good   if innovative horror  i suggest get  the blair witch project   
4,i think type movie watch night order scared  i would n t call horror film  i would n t call thriller either  it s films scares  i thought liam neeson great movie  way cared nell  i thought owen wilson pretty good  catherine zeta jones character little strange  still good character put  but nell played lili taylor great  she stunning performace  now mansion simply amazing  i know probably sets looked awesome  every room extremely awesome  the sets best part movie  acting  location  music  story  very good movie 
3,laughable special effects  lili taylor super great film czj plays hot bisexual  something fun watch drinking cheap liquor eating cheetos 
4,i found movie good scary movie watch  sure enjoy suspence horror movie  worth watching i hope fun  
1,liam neeson pathetic  catherine zeta jones sham  the young boy boring  though gave pity s killed reason  the thing moved girl story  family story  fact  story pretty interesting  s huge disappointment s waiting  except computer effect s almost nothing 
3,the acting really great  aspects storyline bit choppy  the scenery magnificent  special effects best it interesting combination elements  actually  some pretty scary  superb acting made altogether pretty palatable  despite awkwardness plot i never fully understand how character trouble got situation  seemed though vital scenes must cut movie zeta jones really great  i m glad i saw movie character  she darned likeable funny  if really like ghost stories  ll probably like  it reminded older  scary  movies i grew   tense moments ghostly happenings gore 
3,the haunting visualy pleasing movies i ever seen   thus  gets  stars     the plot  messed   wish producers would  forgotten  pg rating killed couple insomniacs  good spfx awesome scenery  rent today the hauntingrated  pg strong horror sequences mild language three stars 
3,the haunting odd movie  the special effects amazing  and much surprise  actually scary  i think may first time adult life i ever screamed watching movie  much surprise fear   but script definitely lacking  i came close pitying nell  main character  really felt lack empathy characters overall rather shocked something happen  i anxious see special effects would used  there serious holes plot  this good movie relax fun  n t expect moving experience 
3,story catholic teen sent spend summer baptist cousins  try convert  he defends catholic faith bible  preachy  interesting  it great premise  bad author amateur  the first half book almost painful read due author s breaking every rule fiction writing known  ok  maybe i m bit harsh    i force keep reading  eventually stopped bothering much   or maybe got better went along   anyway  i found catholic apologetics fascinating  much i knew agreed  i never understood catholics consider peter first pope   shows ignorant non catholics  even us sympathetic catholic beliefs  
4,i think  a philadelphia catholic king james  court  entertaining educational book  the book boy named michael moves kentucky father  in kentucky astounded see many fundamentalists  philadelphia seen many catholics like  while living kentucky  michael learns many things fundamentalist christians  well religion  catholicism  his uncle continually challenges michael religion tries convert fundamentalist  this book interesting worth  this best apologetics novels i ve ever read 
3,the book interesting know anything catholic apologetics  you learn alot faith book  it good examlpe fundamentalists believ apologists defend faith  there unrealistic things thbook mike went knowing lot knowing evrything defending faith  weeks  overall good book suggest read know interested becoming apologist 
3,  a phildelphia catholic kings james s court  tells story catholic teenager finds living among strict  scripture  fundamentalists  this book packed catholic response fundamentalist ideas  it easy read insightful time  anyone wants learn catholic vs fundatmentalist beliefs start 
4,my students enlightened interested main character s encounters biblical fundamentalist s approach scripture  the students learned important apologetic information catholicism 
3,this novel boy named michael clashes fundamentalist christians matters papacy  mary  eucharist  trying understand faith better  i think novel good job explaining catholics believe  i learned things catholics beliefs  one problem i found book beginning dull boring  draw attention  it started become little interesting bible discussions  still boring overall  i found hard relate living farm  overall  i think gook book read find catholic faith  book put 
4,after reading  a philadelphia catholic king james s court   lot better book i thought would i bought  it exciting read way  story line realistic  it seemed almost like author telling  a negative aspect i reading seemed almost impossible michael   philadelphia catholic  read comprehend information bible  able explain short amount time  this seem major fault book  would probably overlook anyway  this book gave outlook peoples view bible lifestyles  this great book  i recommend reading class  time 
4,i enjoyed book much  suprise  when teacher assigned book  i thought i would bored throughout whole book  i think would interested book church fundamentalism  i got book i really started enjoy  i thought good reading experience  as got deeper deeper book  started getting better better  all information catholic religion mary respected church astonished  this book gave great experience learning things catholic faith never thought would learn  i glad teacher gave assignment 
3,i catholic i could really see michael presented catholic faced fundamentalist s views  the book gives good representation two beliefs conflict give different perspective way people view beliefs 
4,a philly catholic in king james court excellent book abou catholic faith  it taught mary important bread eat church really jesus  it taught amish culture kentucky like  the part i n t like though michael learned whole catholic faith couple weeks  when actually takes years study learn tihngs  other agood book educational 
4,i felt book interesting gave lot knowledge catholicism  most kids michael s age would shown interest religion  little hard believe  for part good book gave many important facts 
3,although book exciting opinion  gave new insights fundamentalist catholic views bible  there background information story bible meaning  it explains passages certain sections bible gives understanding time written  i learned fundamentalists view biblical interpretation  if decide purchase book  i recommend pay close attention fundamentalists sometimes contradict  michael  main character  approaches scripture  this book great interested learning catholic protestant religions  know certain sections bible mean 
2,a philadelphia catholic king james s court catholic vs  fundamentalist christians story  michael  main character went philadelphia kentucky  defended catholic views procedures  he tried explain new ideas fundamentalist  open ideas  i personally felt became better towards novel  at first slow moving hard keep track characters  the description became hackneyed  along plot  also  reading farm life hard relate  after heated bible discussions began  story easier read  overall  book better i expected 
1,this novel shows struggle young boy troubled faith  problems within family father s death  uncle s fighting faith  it shows struggle find catholicism  flaws  religion follow  it shows heresies catholicism  along strengths  it sheer lacking amount entertainment book  yet either strengthen weaken faith  it tends utterly dull times  not good book 
4,after reading a philadelphia catholic king james court martin deporres kennedy  got thinking religion i practice  catholicism  as book starts  michael  tragically losing father  thrown world  would seem ready  as gets know uncle les s fundamentalist view bible  begins realize everything practice follow bible  he begins see arguments arise challenged ways bible  the significant change seemed debate pastor brown  though michael seemed cornered slipped harms way  in opinion  book gives excellent overview issues people disagreed split within church  overall  book may seemed boring  depth knowledge provided made get deeper understanding really practice mass 
3,i found philadelphia catholic king james  court insightful book  this book talks struggles boy undergoes confronted uncle happens biblical fundamentalist  his uncle tries show boy biblical fundamentalist proper way worship join fundamentalist church  this book great book read trying find faith catholic 
4,first i say i got book i expected  having envolved religious debates  i relate nervousness michael experienced  being catholic questions faith  i found book given ability look bible find answers questions 
4,the book philadelphia catholic king james court good novel  the book good story premise  based kentucky talked lot aimish farm life  the thing remotely bad book unrealistic events  overal good book  the book looked boring first plot storyline started develop got lot better  if wondering doubts roman catholic faith  i definitely recommend 
3,a philadelphia catholic king james  court boy named michael  father goes live family kentucky summer  there struggled keep identity catholic ensuing remarks bible fundamentalists  looking entertainment perspective book rather bland boring  information obtained book helpful text catholics especially trying find identity 
4,although unrealistic times  book still got accross catholic aproach major misunderstood topics  the book presented fundamentalists contradict catholic view topics  after facing devastating situation early book  michael overcomes defends catholic faith fundamentalists interpretation using good apologetic arguments mainly bible  overall  i thought book interesting although many unrealistic parts  this good book people know catholic faith  it shows different aspects catholiscism well written fictional story 
3,a philadelphia catholic king james s ok descriptive shows faith important life  give three stars parts n t realistic  pretty much enjoyed  read parts stick head remember cleary  example took open book test without book got  pretty hard questions  pretty good book 
3,a philadelphia catholic in king jame s court pretty good book  if someone told would never thought would like  turned bad  it lot good information catholic faith people n t sure belieave things like papacy great respect worship mary  mother jesus  the reason pretty good nothing exciting made keep reading  it overall good book  didnt anything exciting

4,well researched written tome christopher columbus  it thorough point excessive gets slow points information included well presented  the obvious pro columbus bias present  reader understands advance adjust necessary  the research done included actual sailing similar ships along possible route columbus took  another negative time nautical jargon used author hard understand  morison writes understanding reader interested columbus identify technical verbiage  attempt simplify terms without condescending  despite minor bumps road  book well worth time understand columbus rediscovery america 
2,while morison admit genocide indians lead columbus henchmen  idolizes duration book  a brief admittance guilt  morison  surefire way allowing much bias  idealistic portrayal  questionable  character traits  bartolome de las casas  european minister lived time colombus  gives much realistcally bleek look spanish invasion americas  because morison s focus shifts rapidly bad good  loses major points realism  the book reads likerd grade textbook  morison would us believe santa claus toothfairy exists along side saintly christopher columbus

4,i chanced movie completely accident  it wrong box  it opened goats french subtitles  i thought  oh boy  put sleep  yet movie works many levels   like complex detective story  tiny clues sprinkled throughout gradually coming together overwhelming ending  on level  comedy  poking fun pompous scientists ignorant folk  on another  explores unrequited love  topic movies usually avoid  on another lush scenery quaint village life france  yves montand brilliant actor  he packs much depth every second screen  he feels like real person  it movie faces  memorable  complex  elderly  even ugly faces this movie opposite fluff 
4,while i loved movies  jean florette sequel manon spring  i would rate first pair edge second  they masterfully done  really n t watch  inseparable pair  first movie forming background second  second providing resolution first  without giving much story  movies tell story greed   accidental  murder  resolution likes greek tragedy  critically tenderly revealing mysterious nature human heart  two best set movies ever lifetime  my criticismnd movie weak portrayal young woman  came either poor direction perhaps poor casting decision  overall  flaw overlooked  two movies stand classics many years

2,in book many characters parallel  mimicking thefutility cycle meaningless brought onby wars  the characterization lacked depth writ ing beautiful quality magical realism like inother books marquez  again  marquez s focus pedo philia disconcerting how i like writer much yet dislike book  the answer beautiful writing enough tocreate good book  their needs excellence inform content  marquez excellent form heis low content  i found book confus ing book i completed  if hadnot written marquez  i would finishedit 
2,this book extoled throughout years  i tried  yrs ago quit pages  time book group chose  i determined try  after i m  years older  i read slowly  tried analyze deeply become immersed flow culture  about l00 pages  i thought really creative interesting  fifty pages later  i bored redundancy characters  names magical events  it picked last pages  never many previous readers exclaimed  i disappointed  this book n t live hype 
2,this warning think may found new  great author read  forget  i completely disagree best books time  book boring  characters difficult keep straight due author s annoying decision similarly 
2,i cajoled reading  required reading humanity  masterpiece  i fight finish novel  i thought least  would magical allende s house spirits  i severely disappointed  unlike everyone else  seems everyone else   book change sensibilities  the best part book last pages  almost  almost  made pages worthwhile  i doubt garcia marquez  talent  i believe lot lost translation 
5,this lush book i ever read  the content heady like humid air rainforest  it dense wise  human understanding  style straddling poetry prose  i ll often re read paragraph breathless amazement i ve read  i must small bites  s simply rich  like steak bernaise sauce  but re reading brings joy 
4,i read love time cholera  marquez way words  they unlike fiction i ve read  they completely transplant world creates  as love  i felt environment every paragraph experienced atmosphere way i imagined characters experience  this novel particular explores love  pride  deception  family  it evokes feelings passion  pain  longing  fear wasted time  i really enjoy  i hope next novel giving 
3,i would recommend ggm s works every serious reader  however  i would recommend experience history culture context beginning  i read three works quick succession hoping i could benefit  immersion  experience  i think marquez requires preparation 
3,this great book  n t hook  really last  book best  worth bit slog earlier parts  maybe translation spanish english  maybe families n t play key role identity u s culture latin american culture  it n t seem lyrical moving i expecting  nonetheless ggm s writing style unique fascinating  book provide glimpse another way viewing world 
3,from i ve heard  book far powerful original spanish  i lament i n t speak spanish  i felt long stretches book  colonel buendia s various revolutions chapters dealing banana plantation  great  the elements magical realism touching astonishing  but i never grew unaccustomed book s pace  moves herky jerky decades  sometimes focusing single event pages  leaping several weeks single sentence  in  i felt like i n t gotten know single character  all people book mystified  their fears  hopes  regrets  lost 
4,i read book freshman year college  i loved  it many characters flow together  the story magical realism  characters back life  people live years  it follows lives family deals wars  tragic love  mysterious dealings  i thorougly enjoyed reading book i recommend anyone wants enter magical world filled vibrant characters taking sorts political social issues heart bending far go  think dali 
2,this book highly recommended number people knew i going visit colombia  they said would explain culture tell story colombia  after visiting colombia immersing culture history incredible country  i see fit  colombia country energy  action forward momentum rather sleepy melancholy society chasing tail 
2,my experience years solitude people either love absolutely hate  i m apathetic  i read world cultures class college even teacher could tell us relevant class  the repetition s names makes confusing story line  born tail  weird  say least  but apparently book inspires lot people judging previous reviews  i would suggest read reason form opinion 
2,i enjoyed first hundred pages  the symbolism intriguing  confusing many characters meandering plot  i could stay awake long enough finish 
2,in appears stab western values prize winning author created confusing mess many people book wade seeking sort enlightenment prestigious work  nobel prize   when  reality  book sophomoric slap us western european anti communist policies cold war i saying western policies sound  i say communism system supported proven morally bankrupt fiscally unsound  perhaps politics time pushed nobel committee giving award could given elsewhere 
1,what point book  it n t  opinion  the author said reason writing wanted write book incest  i really enjoy graphic descriptions incest  either  i would reccommend anyone  fact  i tell others not read  i would n t read past tenth page i n t required english class 
5,marquez eloquent way words  he canalso spin excellent evidenced book but  i enjoyed book strengthand depth emotion able convey throughthe written word  this book pulls magical andmorbid world holds hostage ending  it isan immense book  well worth committment  i wouldespecially recommend young developing writers  thisbook definitely increase artistic perspectives 
4,the one hundred years solitude gabriel garcia marquez interesting novel i ever read  first starts married couple counsins  afraid child pig tail  myth happens marry close relations  this novel confusing set characters carried generation generation  and novel interesting events ever read  as read novel  actually see charactrer falling life solitude  one this novel good  i highly recommend 
3,i recognize importance book s achievement literary history well latin american literature  book still difficult read i wanted enjoy much  often found lost  maybe s supposed happen  gets frustrating  i found a clockwork orange  trainspotting  maribou storke nightmares slaughterhouse five easier read took work  it n t anything words dialog  i admire simple prose find majority book thoughtful beautiful  circular story structure multitude character names similar  especially later generations  start wear  i recommend  warning 
2,not sure book raved  when i bought  book store clerk told  favorite book ever   that s quite endorsement i found really uninteresting  it s almost exposition  little dialogue  the characters may  memorable    re  boring   none personality  although well endowed  nice  author trying difficult gives similar names  this book felt like authors parents told lots stories fables growing  tried cram long stream consciousness  i abandoned half way 
2,characters n t interesting  the story compelling  the plot engaging  no mystery kind  just dull  much ado   
1,this book total waste time  i kept thinking going lead somewhere reveal something  never did kept repeating names i idea longer cared rambled unfulfilling 
1,i read book recommended oprah considered  perhaps best book ever written   what disappointment   i slogged way  thinking  must get better s best book ever written    alas   didn t i voracious reader  read fro   books week  i noticed amazon recommended  like  ll like catch    i loved catch  i hated book  what i missing 
3,honestly cant really see book particular great deserve nobel prize  book least  i havnt read authors works  may little deserving  anyhow  book genuinely origional  the idea story goes whole family s rise fall great  repetiton names  however much needed underlying ideology story  got little much bear though  bordering annoyance  the book never really drew either  many parts read like history textbook  time last chapters rolled around i reading finish  desperately hoping something save  ending  however meaningful  little late  the book moments  dont get wrong  cons much outwieghed pros 
1,i read  well  really   i got page felt like i d read three times already  book ten years ago i still rank worse piece tripe i ever misfortune across  but i m biased  like latins  i think whole  magical mysterious  cloak latin literature viewed abroad unfortunate  ultimately s kind rubbish sells

4,this surrealistic excursion  told matter factly style reminiscient james joyce  traces life several generations buendia family  ordinary folks living ordinary lives small colombian town accidentally become witnesses monumental events civil  plagues  social oppresion cherishing passionate encounters obsessive fixations obscure activities  only final pages become clear transpired generations foretold rise fall buendia family mystical gypsy maquiliades  i suspect literary masterpiece impressive original spanish version  constant surprises matter fact style compel reader s attention 
5,this favorite novel distance  the novel simultaneously story several generations extended family story entire human race beginning history  it full magic sense magical things happen  glowing prose deeply sympathetic portrayals characters  the repetition near repetitions names generations invite reader conflate information different characters  demonstrating interconnectedness family members  maybe n t matter keep identities straight  maybe re even supposed  let plot swirl let marquez work magic  then step outside notice world shimmers glows 
2,i sorry say i gave book  i tried even read intellectually capable folks reviews see i missing something  i came conclusion individual rarely reads fiction engineer training could probably never  get  something like book  it almost seems technique writer fascinates many readers perhaps substance  the magical realism style much  i regret i could finish nobel prize winning author not maybe future date i go back try  sorry   
2,i made pages  the book boring  a lot sound fury signifying little  there marriages  deaths  love affairs  suicides  battles   lot happen  but  i n t characters  if n t characters  quirky faults seem abstract dull  like dusty butterflies catalog  various lives chronicled  it s dry description adventures i m left     maybe dryness passes sophistication  book left cold 
5,this best book i ve read since the triumph glory  the quality writing superb  the characters unrelentingly vivid become familiar family  a good book  i highly recommend guarantee like  five stars 
5,this books make friends read experienced magic  it hundred years deaths  births  tragedies  joys cursed family  and best part ending  conclusion leave breathless 
4,one hundred years solitude chronicles years family  buendia  village  city   first family line  founded  the prose lyrical flows smoothly river  that  sometimes rapids times calm  the genre magical realism  fascinating watching magic evolve family village  after finishing book  i m  certain marquez meant  though  it anti war anti oppressive regime themes  s something i n t quite put finger yet  i may need re read letting settle 
5,it s sophisticated read many subplots  include characters   it confusing times  s good book learn character  i read book  times since time i read  i discover something new  do n t expect book read move life  it s simple 
5,most likely greatest epic i ever read  the story grips  pulls  commands  concentration  marquez deserves two nobel prizes 
4,this story really geniune effort read  with fantastic journey toy emotions positive negative ways  a little confusing times  steady reading comes together  wonderful piece literature 
5,this book blew mind  i bit slow confusing  many characters similar names  writing caliber seldom seen  the story intense people stick years 
2,marquez  book takes reader lives times i hope atypical columbian    family  covering roughlyss  it fun parts  oddly repetitive  style seemed half magic realism  half freud  and  course  standard enervating anti american diatribes thrown  i guess latin american author even magic realism mode n t overcome predilictions 
3,i ve heard lot book recently  i thought i d give whirl i saw local library  the plot extremely intruiging  buendia family  original settlers fictional town macondo seems south america  the characters unique colorful i enjoyed traveling generations family sharing experiences however  someone generation  sometimes person  named variant aureliano jose  i constantly confused character experienced feeling plot contradicting  i continually flipped back forth family tree provided beginning book caused feel disconnected story  i would lose track plot ended rereading many sections multiple times eventually  i felt like reading book chore  i ll admit  i relieved i finally finished 
2,as i opened book  i thought  wow  this seems like great story   i found growing depressed disgusted every page  although style marquez  technique unquestionably wonderful  overlaying themes lust  lack self control  immorality outweighed good  the goal nearly character s life  please  very characters least bit caring self sacrificing  the way i could reconcile reading disapointing work fact lesson s depravity  i realized every person  without god s intervention  bad worse marquez  perverse characters  the book without high points i loved ending  mystery segundo twins  ursula s strength  there passages language incredible  marquez mastery imagery  i wish positive images remember   
3,relate writing style  otherwise ll find dull boring  just i  i m much fan gabriel garcia marquez s books    written sense writer making story read along   a sense disorientation  i n t like book  i like story line  somthing expect   suspense  drama   vague idea writer thinks hero s    miserable life it s written beautifully  s sure  but s certainly enough  being able write attractive intellectual phrases make bad story better  especially s story  i n t like 
2,one hundred years characters n t  this novel overloaded characters  i n t feel much anything  it lacks focus  failed make anything happened story 
1,the first paragraph book greatest literary history  it s enough compel reader read next hundred pages  unfortunately  book becomes overrated history many praises given say book difficult  confusing  yet conclusion great book  why  why say difficult confusing books good  this parable many characters  magic realism  genre deserves ignored  though s another discussion  to give marquez credit  magical realism response limits placed upon government lived   nevertheless  poor literary form imitated purely awful   intertwining lives  n t move  the story makes reader wonder big fuss  marquez  book miguel litton  news kidnapping much better  book bores bores 
1,i ll clean first  i stopped reading pages  a lot happens book  deaths spirits insomnia marriages  s fairly easy enough figure s going  yet  nothing happens  so much plot takes place characterization suffers  i simply n t happened characters  anyone town  if bomb levelled macondo  i would simply flipped next page see happened next  read characters  if re interested classic worthy praise  characterization king  favor pick sound fury william faulkner  you ll work read  mind soul enriched  faulkner s novels like movies watch slow motion get every nuance  marquez  hand  like movie watch fast forward  you get plot action  said done  nothing sticks mind worthy space occupies 
2,i see unpopular unique opinion  books i ve stopped reading halfway  and i intention ever finishing  despite fact i horde books  i gave away while prose beautiful  story tended toward dull difficult follow  the fact handful names reused dozens characters help much  most characters unlikable hard relate  after awhile i decided i n t anymore is book masterpiece  perhaps  n t mean s good read 
5,one hundred years solitude fascinating books i ever read  i read thousands  marquez giant  his skill like mythical creature  like phoenix combined hundred great authors the pure fact book written amazing  i n t say anything story  if great literature  let life pass without reading marquez  masterpiece 
5,this book captivates beginning  i fell love characters enjoyed colorful lives  the symbolism translation make book kind 
5,this book comes lifetime  everyone read  it interesting journey allow mind senses places ve never  do n t scared number pages  adventure undergo least 
2,this highly overrated book indicates havoc overweight talk show hosts wreak upon literary world  garcia s juvenile frustrating book yammered book clubs world suddenly think know south american authors the book overly long repetitive  themes repeated nauseum  characters   dimensional unbelievable  by time reach halfway point book praying something different happen  then garcia introduces new character  act like others  within  pages  it s amazing quickly mows creations  tired i was in surprises  feel exhausted repetition  underwhelming  nowhere near good  love time cholera   give miss try  blindness  instead 
1,i bought book four years ago finally forced read cover cover  i n t believe   star  reviews people giving  this book big disappointment exiled bottom shelf collection  the characters meaningless  text scattered awkward  perhaps something lost translation  knows  i ve never give book i considered many times 
1,i count hand number books life i unable finish  i oftimes mocked reading  rate i devour books astronomical  i could drag weary brain kicking screaming dozen pages book i love good fantasy novel  anything gives sense magical  i could find anything interesting random inexplicable bizarre occurrences book  mix dry  long winded prose i find something i never done  sitting book hands  looking around room something else 
2,found weird book  could n t get going it maybe translation i might try soon
1,i expected much book  it started interesting enough  seemed drag  in depressing little confusing  i like fiction book entertaining thought provoking  point  i enjoy book 
4,it takes writer like garcia undertake novel mythic proportions  he weaves magic fantasy politics progress greed  loves  hates  incest lies human existence  macondo every place buendia every woman  garcia draws reader experience depth purity soul even constantly parodies high ground bodily functions smell human pain suffering  he lulls reader bliss solitude forces confront unbearable loneliness breeds  here life forms 
5,marquez creates unique fictional world  town called macondo middle south american jungle the language lush  characters unique  marquez finally trusts reader accept fantasy reality equal partners ongoing unfolding life this novel i ve read four times  it works like magic  like great wine  like wonderful piece music 
5,i ony read first pages book adjective  engrossing  understatement  from moment family patriarch becomes obsessed magnets alchemy equipment gypsies marriage rebeca  literary trip far odysseey leaves everybody s family trees wanting aside title theme desolation less obvious equally salient theme discovery relationship science magic dichotomy  i guess essence so called  magical realism  phenomenon   rarely subject matter tackled perceptiveness aesthetic  though i read beginning  i find wishing book even longer already is thank  gabriel garcia marquez 
4,i found book little difficult getting started due way author seems skip aroundand introduces many new characters third book  i began get it the scope novel intimate details emotions feelings gives story realsense feeling  it slow read i kept going back forth four weeks i amhappy read better understanding another place another culture 
2,cuz this book is a  snooze fest   one hundred years of solitude is right cuz that s how much time you ll need if you ever wan na finish this  i highly doubt oprah made it past chapter one zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
5,i guess book usually categorized  apparently  gabriel garcia marquez popularized genre  i loved book would put top five list  there people i ve talked thinks confusing complicated  that case  it s true many characters  help lot named similarly   but  i think distinct developed well  the book town macondo   s people lived  and  able relate book human characters set environment often real occasionally eerily surreal  that s magical realism 
3,ifth july every day  day day  i think would get pretty dang sick fireworks  that pretty much describes i feel marquez book  parade lasts hundreds hundreds hundreds pages  endless display literary aesthetic achievements if  however  remember back days  where s beef   ads  might understand irritation flawlessly written novel lacks cohesive idea  even thread  unify beauty contained therein  is book masterpiece  undoubtedly  perfection style flavor  could  could marquez added substance style  much  sadly  yes 
2,just recently  i decided give book second chance  like reviewers  i hardly ever give book  but pages second attempt  i feeling exhausted  all bright shiny books bookshelves never looked good point  so i came  read reviews feel better  i think i put book away peace appreciating  i say  words marquez uses descriptions  seem created especially world exists within book  but trip worth  i decided  thank helping peace not completing novel 
1,this first encounter magical realism style i love  the buendia family quite possibly intriguing i encountered book  a must read 
1,so nobel prize author s body work say much work famous work  years solitude  crap  s capital letters   if best work famous work labor read works must capital punishment    much like best book century james joyce  ulysses again another book placed solitary confinement   
2,starts good  pages  gets pretty stupid  lots repetition  trite  totally unbelievable  stuff happened book would never happen real life  girl floating sky  people livings  ant book n t even pictures    omg    check general labrynth read something good garcia marquez   call wild  jack london  perhaps best book ever  
1,this hardest read pointless books i ever misfortune trying read 
5,one hundred    first book garcía marquez i read  since i read work  i never impressed book i  moment i finished  i began  the last pages got much i kept aureliano moment  trying skip bits reach find mistery book  is masterpice everyone read least three times  it might beautiful i ve ever read  sure  love times cholera    sure  powerfull 
3,i understand book absolutely groundbreaking created whole new literary techniques  but s thing made slog  i kept expecting get better  n t  i m glad i never assigned read school if i magical realism  i ll stick isabelle allende  though friends say love time cholera amazing  i plan give ggm second chance 
5,i surprised little lost translation book  garcia writes novel poetry  wonderful use language seems braid mystical well humurous aspects writing  this novel i n t forget recommend readily 
3,first i read  love time cholera   that book i keep always open ready moment  so i curious read earlier book marquez  maybe great book   love   i found disturbing mainly fantacy lack clarity comparison  if go mystery underlying meanings lots lots characters  marquez paints vivid word pictures  i think grew wonderfully wrote years solitude  maybe emerged solitude find  love   
2,i even finished brothers karamazov bleak house  i quit  i felt like i wasting time trying remember characters relations world occuring make believe town macondo  marquez may skilled writer storyteller  book confused  bored frustrated without offering entertainment insight so oprah picked labled classic   enjoyable remarkable  i think i made page so with many books read  waste time trying decipher 
2,i think mr marquez far superior story teller writer  it bad n t around fire listening stories instead  this book basically overall plot  many smaller plots little story within  i thought sheer number characters names similar   annoying  i hard time connecting characters due weaving characters  i know family tree beginning  i got tired flipping back point i care to average reader  without discussion group literary expert  many  hidden gems  missed  on whole  i could n t shake vibe i reading extended version old man sea it interesting point reading mexican writer 
2,disturbing  this single word i use describe book although definatley unique composition style  book dark depressing  the theme incest child porn appeared primary focus book instead creationalism eluded reviews it interesting ending worthy time spent leading 
3,yes mr marquez intelligent remarkable story telling ability  thing n t able  get characters  he lost  stars  it certain parts interesting rich detail  i admit  i forced many parts  and mr marquez try act little joycean  making sentences long     look pgs  paperback edition   and yes  i gripe similar sounding names  however reader keeps reading  he she usually figure context  mr marquez  ever win nobel literature  could please pump something i know brillant mind  make care  
4,i read book sophomore literature courses  course selection  i kind blown away  it s type book pick really n t put back without mysteriously drawn back  within bounds book  get sucked wondering world buendía family became  messed  marvelling  progress  town  i n t give five stars i thought became kind murky towards  kind hard follow  be warned though  pretty dark book  re desire resolution occur sake ending  n t read  might make angry  if n t mind bit random humor breeze past bit vulgarity s book  press  it s great read  especially rainy day tornadoes prowl 
5,this book seems move beyond many books message  beauty description  the intricacy almost surrealism plot draws reader intently exhilarating  also  tone calming learn buendia family history  you away book sharper eye magical aspects everyday life  well hours absolute escape bliss  read  you re likely regret 
5,i read book many many years ago i  i read english spanish  at time i n t know either  i read persian  diminish effect  i guess translation must good  i must read book times period year  and still  every i driving car  passage book comes mind takes back magic  i read book  i n t think getting accustomed reality life around heart handle surge emotions  if n t read though  able pull back reality finishing book  i strongly recommend 
4,i finished reading book  like fresh reads staying mind  the writing first chapter fanciful descriptive compares  i loved hated book time  it dark  family infidelity love  it n t mention word solitude re half way  marquez mention  keeps mentioning seems obvious title book  it almost like first says  experience  ah   moment  being happy go lucky person  i found rooting happiness  happiness  it good read  it comes full circle  enjoy
5,magic realism plus rich  beautiful latin culture combines make beautiful novel town s history  so many wonderfully impossible things happen treat read  even heart wrenching moments  i think s riskier books oprah s club  i n t wait see people say  splendid 
1,i m obsessives forces finish book starts i plugged away hoping i d experience enlightenment reviewers seem found   i n t get  maybe lost something translation  i prefer little dialog fiction   even heavy  pretentious intellectual politically correct fiction  i n t mind magic realism  i get bored sentences run two plus pages without period  oh  well  chalk dissent libertarian crumudgeon redneck s educated beyond intelligence  but i underwhelmed 
1,i recognize lots people think book wonderful  however  extremely well read english major  i think marquez must laughing  without repeating comments one star reviewers  i ll say i underwhelmed  it s nonsenical   i noticed   misogynistic 
1,i agree reviewers say book tedious much overrated  i read quite bit  i usually enjoy everything i read  however  i get book  yes  rambling  confusing  adjectives someone else used  but i n t rambling confusing  i n t spoon fed  would nice identifiable path book  i wonder much lost english translation  would much better read native language i hundred pages book  i ll keep reading  keep hoping improves 
3,i purchased  excelent  used books came writing text  this book  excelent condition  
1,i checked book library reading rave review rave review i wanted like  i really  i honestly understand high marks  to book reads writtenth grader  characterization storyline aside  language turned  it seemed stilted  contrived  lacking fluidity  devoid real color  amateurish effort best perhaps reads better native tongue  translation i read atrocious  i promptly returned library  shooting soundly return force richly deserved

4,i avid book reader  i never read anything like book  it definitely different  reviews oprah s book club site stated many people cried  i n t  i n t really like characters  i know cultural difference  basically i think i could get way marquez writes women   incest  let s say i totally amazed find author actually married  however  real experience read discuss book anyone  and ending superb  best i ve ever read 
2,i avid reader  i n t mind challenging read  i started reading book suggestion colleagues  woman book club  i know considered  modern classic   nobel prize  etc   i could n t even pretend like book  to author s credit  imagery descriptions beautiful  i admired magical world evoked style storytelling  but plot next nonexistent  pages  i really felt like i road nowhere  the story went tangent tangent real  identifiable purpose  reading book gave feeling locked room creative  yet nonsensical crazy person n t shut  after  gets old 
2,i enjoyed mostly although hard going  i m sure except i think partly live close people still understand  this group people leading lives solitude although supposed family community  i grew like weirdness like ghosts  bizarre happenings  i think author writing goes head actually real  the cover said enthralling  i think  it said supernatural  magical 
5,my first couple tries reading book n t go far  i never made beyond first chapter  then visit colombia i determined read book  i kept  before long i totally absorbed story  truly fascinating amazing  now i n t know i could get earlier attempts  i m glad i persisted  so  book i originally could n t get  finally became favorite novels 
5,this stunning literary masterpiece  it takes patience get involved story  difficult put  god  i finished reading book felt like i went shock  the prose gorgeous larger story  stories within stories  metaphors striking  will stay rest life

3,the story line interesting compelling family structure disturbing the buendia family loving emotional towards 
3,i usually love anything girl oprah says love  but time  this book good  times hard follow  this novel difficult keep straight  i probablly would given extra star everyone n t named jose something something jose  sorry  i n t get accent thing work   this novel run gauntlet comedy tragedy love death everything witch made emotional  this book kind history textbook witch ok history blood  intended   irregardless emotionally satisfing  but could improved could simplified 
1,this book nobel prize  i n t help  i need write another review this book placed solitary confinement years  this save time trees used printing book do even dare buy book evennd hand bookstore  believe  waste money 
2,my high school english teacher swore god s gift literature  i tend disagree  i understand garcia marquez trying get symbolism  reptitious names slow plot make good book lag 
1,it required reading college  it boring  no wonder selected oprah book selection  most oprah s book boring hype the story follow logic even within story  you get confuse repeated combination names used througout story  i believe   jose  aurelio  miguel  etc  fiction follow logic i know usually story  even work fiction  sets boundaries within story bounded limit  this story waste paper written  marquez overhyped writers nothing show  i guess result literary critic needing sell books get comission publishing house sorry i mean i forced read college felt waste time money 
1,what horrible book  hard read  many characters  i never figure whole thing  i n t believe nobel prize  definitely waste time reading 
1,yawn  pages nothing incest death  characters throughout book  non linear time   s hard follow  how could  book  change life  i fear love  s like emotions dragged mud everything hold dear ethical pushed away like nothing  it incest  personally  maybe something lost translation  it depressing disturbing  i could sleep without lights i finished reading  i would never suggest book anybody weak constitution easily emotionally disturbed  not good reading highschool student  even faulkner s the bear incest  bad

1,this book confusing  jumps around much  many generations book  i could understand book 
2,this novel written interesting compelling prose  characters hardly worth effort  the charaters obsessive bores compared day time soap opera characters  after reading half novel  i numb constant tragedy melodrama  i simply happened characters anymore  to make matters worse  plot extremely complicated difficult follow  new characters added every chapter the amazing thing book popularity helped author win nobel prize 
2,i expecting consistent story least engaging narrative takes fantastical twists  instead  many characters introduced  many  making difficult  also  struggles rebels whoever fighting   think  vague uninteresting  i n t imagine book transfixing many people  count  i guess 
3,it s fun tell members overeducated elite n t novel  after puffing bit expostulating upon garcia marquez s qualifications  important  writer  upon novel  modern classic   give admit n t particularly good read  either 
3,the story tedious read todays readers  it meanders along real definitive reasoning course conclusions i knew i purchased book  difficult story narrative focus  i enjy reading could finish story without skimming middle 
3,to get sense novel  think cross  dallas    dynasty     the simpsons   set mountainous colombian village  imbued hokey magical realism 
1,i read college course  if best world offer time  pulitzer prize winner   i fear nation  it confusing beginning  conflicting ideas presented  speaks beginning world  characters find ancient items   and story line jumbled personally  i found enjoyment reading  the symbolizism supposed find buried deeply i research internet  i finally found things written symbolism  re read book find  consummed quite bit headache medicine get it it far long say   n t much  never i burned book life  i took special joy planning overnight camping trip sole purpose watching burn 
3,i wanted read book title it really intrigued me but reading i could find solitude life people macondo overfilled lonless  everyones life like that the character i like jose arcadio buendia way isolation comical it funny sat tree exactly nothing i enjoy making gold fishes  too the took surprise me however  feelings reading fast i felt like get  i expected i think needs rereading understand 
5,this novel made author succeed s obvious  a story seems s never going finish  incredible ending  i read last page like hundred times already   a personal advise would get chart family tree  otherwise may enjoy i
3,i n t understand hype book  i bought book companion spark notes prepared read world s greatest books  what grind  repetion silly literary tricks  you d better find another  classic  like moby dick  don quiote  faulkner  hemingway  stegner  steinbeck  etc at least i brag i read  unfortunatley i could spent time reading something rewarding if spanish authors  try jorge borges  now s great writer  deep though  be prpared ponder symbolism   but s different pondering marquez  symbolism  marquez style things n t necessarily make sense think   s great writer must symbolic  otherwise would n t lead path   borges  hand make story interesting and deep 
3,as usual  writing excellent book  good descriptions  always draws right setting story like really  the problem i much plot  i page  i n t know story room grow  there lot characters sometimes whole thing little thick i struggle keep  much less 
2,pretty easy read  load tosh  drivel  whatever call  i see comparisons rushdie  if re sort writing fine  read rabelais instead  least get bit chuckle 
1,100 years solitude dense  confusing novel seemingly endless  most characters  either jose arcadio aureliano boys amaranta remedios girls  the chapters long large amounts action  most chapters similar  incest occurs  child born  named jose arcadio  studies melquiades  fights people  mistress  several children   i recommend book anyone wants quick easy interesting read  it well written conveys many themes  purely painful read 
2,though story written unique voice  great classic everyone claims  it often wandered full characters s personality dialogue  mention names  similar could hardly tell apart let s honest  s trendy read right featured oprah s book club  do n t believe hype 
1,i n t understand gabriel garcia marquez get great reviews years solitude  i thought worst piece magical realism i ever read do n t waste time money terrible piece literature  sincerely  pointless  mediocre definitely nobel prize material 
2,this i think problem   i n t like translation book  if novel written spanish translated english  i would say i loved descriptive  flow sentence  i compelled give novel another try based reviews  it years i feel well deserving 
1,after couple chapters book i went online check many people felt great work literature  the words i found repeatedly magical enchanting   when grown desire nine year old girl  wife  gets pregnant  i n t feel enchanted repulsed  fiction  actually make  speaks self far i concerned  and oprah people recommend book club  i clearly missed point lot things male characters shared names make easier  my husband read well felt passages  i glad i finally finished  i really wanted know whole story making mind

5,garcia marquez favorite autor  one hundred years solitude  wonderful book  read every intelligent reader  he deftly suspends laws reality takes world leave feeling returned rejuvenating vacation  this book missed  the writing mystical cathartic  leave breathless

4,when comes comparing  accelerator  fsol works  becomes apparent ratings systems used  afterall   accelerator  fsol s accessable album  something appeals hardcore fsol fans  average techno loving joe may whole  ambient trance  genre fsol s  lifeforms  basically defined  and  lifeforms  full natural sounds music hypnotic almost music   accelerator  full instead beats  structure  usual odd sound clips thrown occaison add variety  and make good album  fsol s best  rating third   lifeforms    dead cities   
4,despite released turn s  accelerator  sounds less old fashioned nowadays either fsol  lifeforms   remembered anything papua new guinea   mixture dub bass  breakbeats dead can dance  a well balanced halfway house intelligent techno ambient  accelerator  frequently gorgeous  extremely nostalgic  in  seemed intelligent electronic dance music would precipitate irreversible shift musical culture  although fsol n t leave much legacy  makes basement jaxx doubly pitiable 
3,i bought record i started getting orbital techno groups  i d heard classic album i listened i realised n t   expander    papua new guinea  pretty good tunes re industrial techno  n t make album   accelerator  n t accessable  especially ve never heard fsol  s bit shallow lifeless  i recommend  we explosive  anyone interested fsol  this album n t bad s probably best avoid unless fan 
2,i decided pick hearing lifeforms  hearing several great things  papua new guinea   believe hype  papua new guinea   it s mid tempo ambient house masterpiece aged marvelously  the rest album however  kind blah  fsol try hand up tempo acid house  results mediocre best  some tunes decent unmemorable   calcium    expander    cheesy un catchy and album whole lackluster  still need hear  papua new guinea   done either purchasing album  two single releases song  translations appears better   that song alone worth price 
2,this album dance  work out  there steady beat musical rhyme album  except papua new guinea  saving grace album opinion   i n t seem fit music mood  unfortunately i rate 
5,accelerator  if n t album  n t know anything electronic music  it s classic through and through  although may sound slightly dated  still stands head and shoulders techno albums today  with impressive range  moody  while others cry  trance forerunner  calcium  nu industrial  central industrial  storming  moscow   accelerator still great listen  this re release includes mixes  papua new guinea   title inspire devotion among fans electronic music  blue states usual downtempo magic track  simian makes sound like carnival hell  hybrid  course  adds hard breaks  satoshi tomiie makes dark house  some good mixes  hold original  what think answer 
4,this disc single handedly changed perceptions modern dance music  though i originally bought cd  alright  techno tracks  it s not my problem  moscow  calcium  i slowly warmed adventurous songs  especially papua new guinea  for n t heard song let tell   youre missing out big time    other good tracks expander  central industrial  remixes

3,i indeed ordered canterbury tales gift daughter  there many options style book available  i specifically searched something appearing little older different hardcover especially liked idea cloth covered   sold item  when arrived however hardcover cloth covered  rather paper covered looks like cloth actual print  that disappointing   i known i would placed order 
1,i looking well structured side by side version canterbury tales  bantam classics normally great jobs books  whoever transcribed kindle know kindle  left unstructured translation place  intermingled lines  translating wrong verses generally place practically  i reading four lines middle english  five lines modern  three lines middle english   lines modern   lines middle english  forth  there connection middle english translation that wasted  usd kindle version huge disappointment    
5,have ever sat amongst friends  maybe even strangers  swapped stories person attempting make appear impelling  this essence design geoffrey chauncer s  canterbury tales   collection stories told group travelers pilgrimage canterbury cathedral  of stories noted  the knight s tale     the wife bath s tale     the miller s tale     the reeve s tale     the parson s tale   chaucer  born earlys  exact date unknown   lived notable life profound impact english literature  much works influenced love distain church form satirical humor  the latter due impart corruption within clergy condition people suffering drought  famine  disease  chaucer s work brought light new age literature full wit  comedy  daily life 
4,chaucer s the canterbury tales nothing short genius glimpsesth century life today  romance  comedy  adventure fantasy  something amuse everyone if re little intimidated original middle english version book  my suggestion read version first  get copy original middle english read 
4,i bought book reading pardoner s high school english class  it s wonderful  translation great  mention chaucer best writers time  i think i may slightly prefer shakespeare  much  many tales things i n t think people even would dare talk hundreds years ago  really cool  i definitely read book  i m mood   
4,thoroughly interesting  the organization book must creative time  a group consisting everyone cook knight set religios pilgrimage canterbury  a humorous tavern owner suggests way help pass time  everyone tells story  persone tells best story gets free dinner  the stories range serious tales chivalry love  knight  disgusting perverse  summoner   apparently chaucer planned member party tell two tales  i suppose n t get around finishing collection  also  i think  stories complete  s every edition buy 
1,the annotation style edition ruins  putting definitions words line text  rather footnotes notes  disrupts flow reading  it quickly gets confusing original text editorial comment  i m find another edition partway first poem 
5,clearly  chaucer s time  english language looked inderior languages europe  the canterbury tales important use venacular language england  it represents first look language 
2,i find unfortunate i wasted money book i could read entire story internet  of course  story copyright  ll find internet  complete do n t waste money like i  even worse  i never even read book my rating size book  like i said  i never read  i forced issue rating  i wanted enter comment  
2,this version canterbury tales modern english brilliant  nonetheless i deeply disappointed finding parson s tale omitted completely  reason  interest general public   i disagree sweeping statement 
3,every english speaker read chaucer  as dante italian  chaucer english  making english vernacular accepted language write literature  standardizing usages inspiring imitation  making adopting literally hundreds upon hundreds words language  chaucer old english ends middle english begins this translated version okay get story tales  find like chaucer even smallest bit i would strongly urge try reading original middle english  it honestly hard give effort richly rewarded  chaucer s poetry simply breathtaking  this translation decent  know missing half show 
1,this easy read kindle format  in paperback  two translations  middle english  modern english  these displayed side side  earlier english left  modern right  when comes kindle edition  breaks translations  it switches back forth without notice  making really difficult follow  it would alright could view page page  s original format   without option s harder understand   yes  s obvious part  finding stops starts takes away reading experience  it s choppy   in short  buy paperback perhaps different kindle edition  the format makes challenge read 
5,i suppose freshman college student read tales  i professor read us olde english  it really fun really got grasp english language coming  poetry i went english class read whole works  they good  classic short stories  you really going back basics  the stories easy read everyday type people everyday lives  you get classic english literature  history  short story writing techniques  roots english language medium sized book  ca n t beat  it s bargain richard edwardnoble  the hobo philosopher  author   a summer charlie  
4,the canterbury tales favorite book  i personally enjoy original middle english version would highly suggest interested   i purchased copy everyman s library series the canterbury tales favorite used bookstore   though i read everyman s library version many times i repeat many sections word word  i nevill coghill s translation delightful  it best translations book i read  i  course  would suggest reading middle english  frusturated confused language i would recommend translation  it sticks closely feeling get chaucer s original text  i gave  stars instead  middle english version always hold number spot heart 
4,this book collection short stories  many funny  i found self getting bored 
5,the first story  the knight s tale    aucassin nicolette   andrew lang   the friendship  amis amile   old french romances  william morris  usually bought alibris used book put      in opinion  the knight s tale  reason purchase read the canterbury tales  it unmatched heard audio book  blackstone audiobook  unabridged  read fred williams  isbn    i purchased audio books cassette  
4,i remember reading book soph  yer high school sruggling lot translation  but addition much easier fallow  his stories represent motliest crews english literature  wife bath put away five husbands looking sixth  pardoner  reeve  clerk  knight  the millers absolutely histerical crack  hope enkoy reading book much 
3,nice good shape  old expected  good price  enjoyed 
3,if read fascinating account classic banned  look claudia johnson s stifled laughter  a rousing true life story battle provincialism town lake city  florida religious right decided chaucer bawdy crude high school seniors 
3,for middle school kid i thought the chanterbury tales n t great book  the complex language boring discussions made book really dull  some stories far better others  happy reading
3,please note  the bantam version  translated hieatt  contains popular tales   use  inside book  feature check table contents  i  alas    the facing page translation i looking  really wanted complete set 
5,well written beautifully illustrated  a good introduction chaucer young old  a good winter read indeed 
5,   chaucer s  canterbury tales  timeless  the tales  mostly verse  although prose  told part story telling contest group pilgrims travel together journey southwark shrine saint thomas becket canterbury cathedral  these stories paint pictures medieval life  theology  culture and edition preferable  i highly recommend    
4,the canterbury tales appealing due s diverseness  chaucer involved every level society time  this shown characters well rounded  the short  insightful description travelers helpful picturing group riding thier way shrine becket  a great book everyone read  mood  also n t expect continuing theme story  short stories sometimes leaves hanging 
4,the canterbury tales chronicle contest  a storytelling contest pilgrims way canterbury  this probably best translation i read  it downfalls author excluded tales including parson s actually meant conclusion  chaucer died could finish tales   other book good  it break myths sterotypes people time stroies rather humorous could still considered humorous todays society 
3,when i read  back high school  english teacher pumped much beforehand  i expecting hilarious  rollicking fun read boy i disappointed  we read maybe slightly updated version olde english  main part struggle figuring hell going  then  finally figured  something maybe kind of funny  satirical yet juvenile way  it basically takes hour decode  miller cheating wife   oh  say goat if difficult read   i would say read existentialism  the payoff road  usually  biting  social commentary like anti semitism bad  n t worth pain ploughing weird spellings antique words 
2,here lesson learned  write dirty stories  wait hundred years everyone say genius wrote classic  really  nothing chaucer i n t hear locker room local gym  why stuff taught classrooms  because tenured professors think written middle english must revelation life  the could said anecdote told average joe  would seriously 
2,if like television series  the simpsons   probably like chaucer s canterbury tales  they reflect vulgar approach entertainment  instead making us rise gutter everyday life  brings us lowest level crudity  there redeeming tales however  knight s tale  whole  book avoided anyone sense honour decency 
4,in order understand english litterature english language  many read  least tried read  chaucers  canterbury tales   i begin  sort finished  work middle english  hard might lead think  quite labourious painstakingly slow times  with version  great compromise found  translating true original possible yet modern english  i know every time make rewrite translation  things lost  sometimes necessary  quite convenient  this times it great fun reading canterbury tales  the structure work makes accesible easy pick time away  you could treat whole entity collection short stories centered around group persons pilgrimage  one books decent home library n t without 
2,the lonely planet phrasebooks usually great help travelling around world  this however turned creating problems solving  the transliteration weird actually learn two new languages pronouncing anything closely right  i tried book several english speaking lao persons lao speaking native english speakers travelling around country problems transliteration  nothing like would naturally pronounce  for example would say khoj see khawy  helpful lao bit point  i got around  a pity  much better transliterations around 
2,this phrasebook looks reasonable respects  lao english dictionary  that means  trying communicate someone speak english  respond words  even motivated patient enough try carry conversation the description book said  comprehensive dictionary   unfortunately  half comprehensive dictionary  if book make possible actually converse lao speaker  
5,this movie excellent  absolutely extraordinary paired sequel  manon spring  i highly reccomend two pair anyone considering either 
3,i saw film  thought good  good effusive praise heaped upon  so  i see sequel then  someone i know excellent taste said  wait minute  trust  must see sequel   well  i took advice  finished watching sequel  manon spring   manon sources   together  excellent film i would give   stars the first film   jean florette  really half film this really  two disk set  perhaps financial considerations forced film maker split two normal length films  instead long  but  prepared watch both also  i echo another reviewer s comment light cheerful entertainment  rather honest look treat 
3,the story wonderfully simple told typical french style withfocus characters strengths weaknesses  it deserves  stars  i downgraded dvd korean supplierdone letterbox options 
3,i saw movie high school english class  i surprised see video  i remember wondering happened next  now i know movie  i get sequel  even though i m curious find rest story  i would n t rate greatest movie time  still  n t anything better  watch  it interesting  comical  sad moments 
5,in answer to the first review about this movie  most people  in the united states  are really ignorant of what good films are all about  they are blinded by today s  hollywood  industry which is less than perfect  to say the least   everyone    do yourselfs a favor  start watching more foreign films    most of them are not pretentious  not shallow  not hollywood    everyone might learn a thing or two great film  full of good content and meaning   
2,since purchasing dvd player year half ago  i often across reviews bemoan  transfer quality  particular title  now   i know talking about while all time favorite movies  i extremely disappointed picture sound quality  film grain evident throughout times highlight values picture seem overexposed i give movie  stars  i give  transfer  star  since likely re released  special edition  i would reluctantly recommend buying title  longer shelf life vhs edition 
5,truly  all time favorite movies  it realistic story made possible see thinks acts life  everything reason  highly recommended movie  cheers  branko miros

2,i studied titanic many years  starting way james cameron s film  many  facts  presented work go given tons authors explorers titanic  the author seems full  trying give credit n t deserve  it almost seems trying convince everyone co discoverer titanic robert ballard s best friend  i would recommend another author  actually love titanic n t trying make look better 
2,after reading glowing reviews book amazon com  i purchased eagerly awaited arrival  i first read  a night remember   could n t put  this book  hand  difficult stick  the author n t seem know quite wants write  he goes back forth actual sinking  interesting  stuff found lord s book   discovery ship  includes great deal technical dialogue   challenger explosion  perhaps connection bit stretch   as someone become interested subject titanic  result movie   i found book disappointing  the author seemed interested letting us know involved  personally  entire expedition  n t interest  nice try  cigar 
4,dear readers  this book definitly worth reading  not give information finding  unsinkable ship   story going time fateful night  i tell though  s heart wrenching emotional times  some information gives machines used find titanic  stuff like  that little hard understand  probably would young children  i hope enjoy book  go back titanic

2,okay  i m sucker john goodman  s far sexiest cast  i ll admit i enjoyed movie mainly   i actually pay rental   b  i consuming large amounts alcohol time  to film s credit  even drunken stupor i could tell scenes piper pretends sing incredibly corny  i think i remember falling sofa landing head extreme cheese ness  you know  the kind makes skin crawl  in true bruckheimer form  leanne rimes organizes high speed train robbery results spectacular car wreck involving two commercial airliners seattle space needle   i n t spoil anybody  see  read  see   two stars 
2,this kind film i get stuck watching long plane rides would never seek  it silly schlock i marvel hollywood mill churn things make money  s really industrial production process  geared superficial viewers this basic plots  the others include crippled boy  whose love pony allows walk  love  talk  why keep watching junk  a video game least offers chance variation outcome ok  goes  beautiful girl dream  seeking big break  gets gig bar  handles  meets boy n t fit plans  shakes  shakes  shakes lot  flirts corruption  stays course  makes real friends  gets know real self  grows  oh  succeeds terms not recommended  admittedly  acting abysmal  waste time lives could never exist

2,my friend likes movie i checked  i n t like  kind boring  could n t get whole thing  fastforward solved problem  
3,when saw movie big group people  reception mixed  my s light easy to swallow souffle  it s fairly cute  occasionally clever  occasionally bad  never tries reach level dramatic depth  succeeds within limitations  the story fairly hackneyed painlessly rendered  violet  piper perabo  moves new york become singer songwriter  instead finding provacative bartender coyote ugly bar  whilst falling love australian fry cook  adam garcia   i prefer movie infinitely jerry bruckheimer creations  it much better flashdance  similar themed story true acting n t oscar worthy dialogue falls flat  movie trying  entertain  and succeeds enormously a guilty pleasure   extra note  dvd provides entertaining commentary tracks cast relay scene joyful glee  
2,the usual girl goes to the big city cliches  bad d expect mr bruckheimer  thanks lovely charismatic ms perabo nice performance mr goodman  dad    still  gal aspires write songs absolutely nothing to say  that whole whitney mariah thing  yecch the bar scenes certain energy em  coyotes apparently hopes dreams  personalities  here s hoping adorable piper get great even better movie near future  i definitely following career

5,definitely chick flick guy movie  honesty though  great movie  although geared towards younger girls  m sure anyone could enjoy movie  great movie d recommend anyone 
4,this great movie  best seen  it full ambition  young girl finds job bar coyote ugly  bar job  boss living dream gives courage fullfil dreams  full laughts great ending 
4,piper perabo exhibitionist stage fright  okay  n t suspend disbelief movie  hang back closet forget even exists two hours  but beer flows freely  s lots t  a guys nipples and ripples ladies  s highly improbable satisfying cameo leann rimes belting  ca n t fight moonlight   song  think  slight yet satisfying movie is i n t go plot  not s anything give away  really  s secondary bar scenes music  but n t go movie expecting acting actual story  accept on screen party  pretty enjoyable time great movie getting dirty date 
3,if re looking film s smart and sexy  n t  however  relax fill mind couple hours loud music  gooey romance   dreams finally fulfilled  kind story  right movie  the women dance hard  boy cute  founders group tap dogs   songs violet writes little sappy pop  playing new girl  piper perabo turns believable performance wide eyed hopeful big bad city  however  always little convenient everytime around get hot water  always saves day  the supporting cast women indeed bad girls punching guys mouthing whenever possible  the features dvd actaully pretty inventive  so means buy movie re gon need something thoughtless get nighter slow friday night  in short  s brainless fun 
2,i bought movie i love jerry bruckheimer movies  i rented  the entertaining part movie bar scenes  shown trailer  that sums good scenes  when i watched featurette hard looking lead actress excited find piper perabo  i could n t believe  perabo s acting annoying  ruined whole movie  her fear singing public became irritating movie proceeded  i wanted smack say stop whining sniveling  i m people like kinds movies  even really bad ones  i n t think i watching 
1,this movie dumb    how dumb is it   this movie dumb even though bunch hot chicks dancing around sexy clothes provocatively anything sexy provocative  dumb  dumb  dumb did i mention stunk 
1,yeah  let em spend day ted bundy   let s see damn tough act experience  stupid women 
1,this movies really disgusts way depicts women stutting stuff drooling   i absolutely hate type flicks  hey  little imagination pretend strip bar taking em  i found looking women bar  none  pig s  t you jerk think cool  needless say i  i much appreciate hot women  n t get wrong  this sucked 
2,a plot story done  better  miserably bad acting  tara banks  leanne rymes  only highlight  john goodman  better yet  rent something else 
3,i know title confusing allow explain  when i went see movie best time ive movie theatre since    ever  everyone actually dancing singing laughing ive never seen movie made whole theatre people  best  i thought opening credits pretty boring  certain scenes movie  i guess kinda need love story parts tie together though  i really didnt like perabo s character much  kinda bothered  i dunno actually seemed kinda stupid  cant really explain  over i thought movie pretty entertaining good   seeing wet girls jump around bar wasent bad either 
1,this biggest waste time i ever seen  the person would interested movie thirteen year old boy  tyra banks stick day job  she much better model victoria s secret never open mouth  speak  i wasted hour  half life back  this movie predictable  lame  do n t waste time 
5,coyote ugly may ideal family movie excellent  tells story young female musician whose dream someone like whitney houston mariah carey sing songs  after moving new york forced find work order remain living apartment  she meets coyotes finally finds dreams  excellent movie great cast 
4,as aspiring singer  i found film closely related struggles musicians go  unlike violet  i n t stage fright  matter fact  i love stage  however  taking odd  jobs something i m relatible  even tho i ve never taken job bar quite like coyote ugly  shows trying achieve dream  whatever possible  so far comes dancing bar  i ve ever done fun  goes prove n t easy time trying make music business  type scenerio incredibly possible re desperate  whatever takes  even means sacrificing little bit dignity   even tho still hell lot fun  over film easily   s girls shaking bar  s getting 
4,i m pretty sure us guys whose seen trailer first time thought movie targeted male audience  but guess  producer jerry bruckheimer fooled us  it s   chick flick  but s   good chick flick  not piper perabo s character infectiously loveable  coyotes hot sexy well  the plot n t extra ordinary  s fun watch help great soundtrack funny moments  the dvd features behind the scenes look movie  cool graphics  music video leann rimes 
2,now  mind movie  too much focusing women dancing bars story characters  hence boring movie  women good  movie boring  now see wouldnt get table dance  nope  thing  john goodman piper perabo s father treat though  this tyra bank s first big movie breakout see nice  as far m concerned thought coyote ugly  would  except piper perabo  maria bello trains new recruit would new moves   also starring adam garcia 
2,really boring dull cjhick flick awful  lov tira  t ggod movie  didnt wantt watch thers people  go club 
2,viewed  rate   coyote ugly displayed fair story made skin crawl  a dopey looking girl happens dance sexily like never got everything going big city new york  that ll never happen  this film explains reason i nightmares taking  eventually dropped  women s studies college  i n t need manhandled like film like coyote ugly  telling women like depicted film bomb everything  i rather watch true films  touching realistic issues surround females hoop dreams  my left foot  the miracle worker  crappy movies like coyote ugly  what s title  really  s concept  no  really   s actual realization movie made  maybe i open bar  women wooing male patrons  music deported prison numerous pimping violations 
2,i glad i waited see movie cable  minutes  i almost changed channels  but  like accident police car chase  watch  overall  movie sappy  and every  twist  surprising  also  i n t understand movie switched color black and white  i m guessing decision made late editing session n t seem context  in conclusion  i thought bar scenes best   i n t believe i m agreeing guys  i encourage check cable listings re curious movie spend money something better 
1,i rented poor excuse movie could n t help falling asleep whole time  it s pretty predictable entertaining  it s really worth buying 
4,this great movie aspects technique storytelling  it movie thing great  entertain  the sole purpose movie entertain viewer   footloose    dirty dancing  great movies never forgotten entertained viewer   coyote ugly  feel good movie  the music energizes audience  the bar dancing keeps movie watchers interested  i went movie two friends girls  i  we really liked movie  the rest night dancing around singing music heard  this great movie leaves lasting impression viewer 
4,i saw movie i m leann rimes fan she s it i pretty impresed movie i highly reccomend anyone almost  definately must see 
5,the strengths dvd   a nice storyline shows country girl tries survive ny    nice music  ca n t fight moonlight  etc  throughout show    girl appeal esp  innocence piper perabo sensuality coyotes    romance nice ending     various commentaries movie   music video ca n t fight moonlight 
5,i thought going really stupid movie bar dancing scenes  i wrong bar dancing scenes tried put story 
1,coyote ugly worst cgi special effects i never seen years movie bashing  actually  i started watching movies last week  due coyote ugly  i ll never watch another bad movie 
2,this movie pretty boring surburban girl going new york getting dreams crushed finally making big time  being year old male  thing movie enjoyable nice looking girls  the guy movie worst acting jobs ive ever seen  nothing ever really happens  if good taste movies  shouldnt like movie  again  i year old girl  i would probably like movie geared towards year old girls  to give movie credit  kind  cute  story  thats   also  bar like going bouncer  gim break  
3,i personaly thoght movie made make guys droole sneak pretty bad story line small portion girls would hopfully enjoy  i hear people saying  oh going classic love story  mean obviously movie weak predictable storyline hopfully cover s main attraction hot chicks dancing tight cloths  but twist opinion i guy therefor gained star two hot ladies  i think smart  teen movie goer  like  would agree
1,piper perabo great new hollywood i look forward seeing next  that said  i believe director editor  later  taken public place caned bamboo pole what starts cute girl coming of age in the big city movie begins fall apart moment girl s shy sing front anyone starts working bar requires dance bar getting buckets water dumped   oh i m shy sing songs front new date  i ll strip   what    there spasmatic sequence phone call  trip club  family reunion performance spliced together mtv editor drank way much mountain dew eating pixie sticks  one character even repays debt cut could n t even known owed  hopefully piper better luck  slap her  she s french  year 
1,you know re watching bad movie partner leans  without ever seen movie  outlines plot detail  including accurate descriptions scenes follow minutes opening credits run what earth bruckheimer thinkning made  i assume contract studio produce certain number movies fillers an unlikely plot say least  acting substandard john goodman  usually decent actor  looked embarassed associated  seemingly hanging scenes waiting check clear could leave i ve doubt movie earns least  stars many people use site  teenage girl mid s male i m sure think awesome  movie  utter dross  hollywood really needs fresh injection writing talent 
5,i thought movie good girls hotter john goodman mojave desert  bruckheimer great job story line really good
5,i tired reading reviews people think every movie artistic masterpiece  least  poignant message  this entertaining films wife i seen long time  none people involved production anything apologize  it unquestionably delivers exactly bruckheimer  intended  pretend anything else  if i wanted something artistic meaningful  i would looked word  miramax  outside box  studio made many wonderful movies  type high impact  simple fun jerry bruckheimer late don simpson delivered well  sometimes  s doctor ordered turn lights  turn volume  break popcorn  drinks  enjoy  
1,this embarassingly bad films i ve seen recent memory i watched year old house understandably amused girls early twenties dancing top bar   and willing watch non plot half hour scenes  short pubescent male  i think anyone enjoyed movie either miguided  hopefully  idiot if really person looks film  let recommend saving money watching nearly television sit com   they re bad n t cost four bucks pop  take extra four bucks donate library  that way  people dragging human race intellectually depth least offset damage hopefully lifting someone else 
2,i m usually disappointed bruckheimer film  definately first  the plot cheesy slow  all american  apple pie  girl next goes  the big city  make big music business   meets good looking orphan helps overcome stage fright romantic ways  the movie would better  indeed  women coyote ugly  the bar owner s story would resulted better movie less misleading title  this movie likely hit teeny bopper backstreet boys fans junior high school age boys 
3,there loud explosions endless amounts ammunition fire film  this unlike majority bruckheimer s pictures  however  instead guns violence get drunk women dancing top bar cool music  the movie centers around main character violet  played rising star piper perabo  rocky bullwinkle   she movie  big apple  local small town desperate work  she struggling song writer dealing issues singing work  she needs money getting desperate  enter bar coyote ugly  from watch cocktailish movie stars like tyra banks  maria bello  melanie lynskey call shots  most would say chick flick worth watch  but watching women give orders  n t help enjoy 
1,nothing really happening film the girls looking good far film goes much happening it s films watch pure t  a type mood it s fairly air head film 
5,i watch  i wait tv i finally bought
4,i love movie  watched first time best friend realized copy great movie

5,this first garbage cd i really enjoy  the words powerfull shirley manson s voice amazing  i highly recommend cd 
3,what say album melds pop hooks rubbery blast guitar riffs indelibly wonder thought sooner   and  bon jovi  n t count   unlike bands may accused sellout status  garbage nimbly avoids niche constructing pop songs without compromising edginess  credit shirley manson singing without saccharine grandstanding today s divas kudos butch vig producing sharp sound replete hooks beg repeat brain

3,in perspective popular songs time  i enjoy historical value songs past  hearing someone sing things may learned history book  makes real 
3,it  think stinks  strange mix rubber orange smell  abating week sitting next open window 
5,i ve watched one tree hill since first episode first season  i say i m passionate show i used  characters lucas peyton left i thought would ruin show  however  lead show growing getting know smaller characters  season seven one tree hill amazing actors actresses great  it s good show dvd allows episodes watched without commercials  it s smallest compact dvd case seasons  i    i would recommend item 
4,i ve watched every episode season   i really loved  i m big sophia bush fan  i love work  i love brooke julian relationship  i think worth watching  haley nathan still going strong  i like new characters  of course feel emptiness lucas peyton cast really makes absence   maybe return episode two  i would like see brooke s almost adopted daughter make return 
2,first  peyton favorite character  second  haley  mouth millie unlikable characters  opinions  does anyone skills girlfriend lauren  mouth job  and yet  nathan haley s marriage shaky ground  everything seems recycled  fortunately  clay beacon light  a likable guy seemed unable commit  found love quinn  yet schwahn decides kill someone  haley quinn s mother  yet  schwahn uses plot line crazy stalker  unfortunately  character dan much season  attempts funny made  girls getting high brownies  attempts failed  terrible season  the reason i watch season  clay  i ve watching since beginning  the show ended season   
2,i purchased set early december paid  next week target returned   bought another dvd set  house  found cheaper bjs   week christmas amazon put    check prices look around   i overpaid total charged  amazon returning took week credit though   
5,when i found lucas peyton show  i disappointed i think would able coninue show well without  characters  but  new characters  show still amazing always  very entertaining season  i could stop watching 
2,this good product overall  bad quality  seemed like burned original  every disk says disk title scene blurry parts episodes pretty choppy 
2,first  i say i watched entire season seen entire series  this season pitiful there points laugh loud stupid corny  nobody acts like jamie s character goodthth seasons become stupid  the show n t without lucas peyton  s dumb  the writing terrible  worst show year  i ve never seen anything corny  the new characters ok  show n t surviving without lucas peyton pointless stupid without  even without  s bad writers producers could n t make interesting dramatic  instead s full games  messes  snowball fights  stupidity  do n t waste time money  try shows like  gossip girl  the vampire diaries  others would way worth time money 
5,no problems order  received item within time frame  have n t played dvds yet new packaging problems dvd would seller fault 
4,rather skipping cd buying  strauss dances   i recommended june  buy copy onto two sides minute audio cassette rolfe kent s soundtrack holds well time  except last number  vocal heard movie  rearrange re engineer songs like  i put  tivoli rutsch walzer  tape been you might find django rhinehart s  honeysuckle rose   worked well movie  insert  lose  back where you belong  vocal let sting sing last on side  let gaudier ensemble serenade  tivoli  whatever dances like  voila  perfect tape 
3,the soundtrack  kate  leopold  includes wonderful  still  sting  rest soundtrack instrumental  while stirring reminiscent movie  calling images dialog s memory  s something listen  if find  n t incidental soundtrack  buy song 
3,joanne long s reviews right target  i bought soundtrack sting s masterpiece  until   while score lovely times  i find tuning  the flavor  movie  strauss dances  missing  buy soundtrack sting s deeply moving waltz  i find song recorded anywhere else  then follow ms long s instructions perfect recording

1,as surfer yoga enthusiast excited see program created  however  upon watching video became clear s great  it s hard follow poses n t see instructors feet b c re buried sand unless decent knowledge yoga lot important details many poses left  i d recommend non surfing specified yoga dvd  you ll get 
1,n t waste money lots wasted time talking great yoga is content good alot fast fowarding not useful work video 
1,this video good  peggy seems like regular soccer mom decided could make yoga video  her instructions arent good form good enough teaching others  the editing pretty bad  and worst theres awesome surfing clips head bent  how supposed watch sweet barrels  maybe two yoga surfers better i m 
1,i purchased video  impressed  it nice surf footage  yoga instruction really bad  the time would better spent slowing going yoga pose  versus racing large number poses  skip dvd  lesson local yoga place 
5,what great video  i received went routine  the flow wonderful   i surfer  never surfed  i looking good video  everybody recommended   but maybe i ll surfing summer 
4,i hate excercise dvds  yoga dvds  instructional videos  i yoga surfers every night  its really decent  tolerable video  im getting shape get back surfing really helping  it makes muscles nice long  lean  loose  the relaxation part really fantastic helps stay focused reach goal surfer  my complaint slightly talk ey  i could less talking  overall though  lovely music  peggy hall great teacher  relaxing  i would say great purchase level 
2,as far yoga instructional dvds go  i would recommend  particularly familar yoga already  the poses explained well not for surfers dvds  often times  see feet instructor  know place feet unless already know pose  i think peggy probably good instuctor  dvd n t good example  the best part dvd advert rochelle s surf camp  includes cameo appearance minnie driver  i found portion dvd inspiring  if looking instruction yoga poses  good choice 
3,i enjoy pace variety  the pre surf surf sequences effective arranged well  a great way stay relaxed focused water  after  weeks i began notice increased flexablity upper body strength i ve noticed measured improvement i surf better  longer   so  stars  the downside narrative interview part kind chops bit making pre surf warm seem little like infomercial taking away could should instruction beginners technique wise  even camera focused instructor s often waist  i enthusiastically recommend dvd only already several dozen yoga classes belt 
2,this perhaps worst videos today type  if basic knowledge yoga  n t need  create tailor workout  if n t know yoga  s useless  the instruction poor  peppered split screen people surfing practicing yoga  wonder surf mags think s great   little  poorly demonstrated techniques basic yoga  in scenes n t even see feet  crucial failure   even  instructor  says  save money  yoga long enough learn properly  apply surfing  yoga great surfing  poor video 
2,if know anything yoga  buy cd  the positive parts location view waves  this novelty useful  honestly yoga wetsuit pipeline try ali mcgraw s video great intermediate yoga tape 
3,the format book bit confusing  s ok  some lessons incredibly easy  others really difficult  i guess s expected

3,this book contains valuable techniques worth owning  opinion   i personally use ideas taught therein  for jujitsu book even replete techniques  however  i recommend basic book jujitsu  i use several ideas guide  
3,i thought book reviewed lot explained husband difference ju jitsu kwion 
2,the previous reviews must students theauthor s  students students author s  perhaps friends ofthe author  i n t imagine anyone thinking book good  a good comedy  maybe the techniques ju jitsu book almost offensive terms practicality  and though outline tactics concepts applying techniques art  likely book students read brush tests  serious self defense in fact  book interested learning self defense  buy book get killed street  otherwise avoid  unless re student author  course  i d hate see  basic  book like  funny particular book  s worth money buy  even good laugh 
3,if liked movie  ll like book  they almost exactly  it s written well traditional elizabeth chadwick style   movie script  i highly recommend books not based hollywood movie

3,the game much smaller i expected  i actually went back review purchase make sure i n t accidentally buy travl version    overall  s cute game  yr old enjoys  it easily  broken   jaw becomes unhinged  far easily repaired time 
5,i actually ended buying update two old cabinets across  thought needed speakers  turned crossover speakers shot first place  then friend gave jbl set  bass mids highs  old big screen tv free keeping project low cost possible baught  they nice sound price did t expect results got  picky sound m satisfied  plus easy figure hook  terminals marked 
5,i absoultely love mero  i wish single  i n t get enough  i listen single without getting tired  it s group two guys  s entirely pop sounding  it s fun loving music relax enjoy 
1,i glad see disc reissued  even cd r  despite beautiful music  i recommend disc lack information track listing  there liner notes  timings indication composer wrote piece  as rarities mostly interest serious collector listener  major failing 
3,i prejudiced mytile stedman s re release dated book  adobe archtecture  that book  copyright  actually filled designs s  the current volume remodeling fireplaces filled drawings  photos actual structures  the house plans feature small rooms appear taken directly adobe architecture book  many drawings little content  i suspect subject matter far better handled elsewhere  author trading reputation 
5,this series so hilarious  i upset i found cancelled it if watched religiously like i airing mtv    i believe   n t dissapointed  in s short episode run  plenty laughs  you get  hands  you ll plenty quotes share friends weeks 
5,if know show probably n t need tell good  if new buy  it fun never slows  unfortunately season 
3,political scientist james q wilson undeniable brilliant cultural commentator  unfortunately  essays collection move snail s pace failed fully engage  i would found beneficial employed anecdotal vignettes rather utilize broad  abstract approach addressing social problems most collection previously released publications delivered speeches  i read work past  selection far cream crop still crepuscular presentation fully obliterate smart insights conveyed among included passages  at times may require readers deeply hit pay dirt  scintillating nuggets buried within pages 
2,this classic film  alas  aged well  unlike double vinyl release show  dvd rendering sounds like recorded thorugh telephone  the dvd  fact  excellent document historical stuffs  suffers source entertainment  the sound simply terrible  although dated  would think better sound could mixed   purchase die hard bowie fan  like   if n t know bowie  n t start 
3,despite dvd possibilities  video quality n t improved much  the quality n t good  worth fact concert historic event should recorded  however  setlist great mick ronson really shows knows  the setlist is  hang onto yourself  ziggy stardust  watch that man  wild eyed boy from freecloud all the young dudes oh  you pretty things  medley    moonage daydream  best show  really great guitar solo  edited put backing vocals    changes  space oddity  my death  cracked actor10  time11  width of a circle1  let s spend the night together  rolling stones  song   suffragette city1  white light white heat  lou reed s song   rock n  roll suicide
2,the fatal flaw video bowie s performance  brilliant   inferior production quality  it appears pathetically low budget production  pity considering done  d a  pennebaker  wonderfully documented bob dylan s british tour  do n t look back     as  sound quality ziggy stardust performance quite poor  mics positioned yards away stage  moreover  camera work times annoyingly erratic inappropriate  the whole production  strangely  reeks amateurism  if movie would made  example  production quality led zeppelin s  the song remains same   would well worth watching  unfortunately  bizarre sight bowie action saving grace 
3,when stuff current  bowie hottest  coolest  glam est  now looks dated  laugh affectionate sort way  it s great memento  video bad whole thing cheesy feel s probably something d back  still  s good fun  hits day  s worth viewing two 
3,when stuff current  bowie hottest  coolest  glam est  now looks dated  laugh affectionate sort way  it s great memento  sound video bad whole thing cheesy feel s probably something d back  still  s good fun  hits day  s worth viewing two 
3,this tape record bowie spiders mars  it next best thing spite unpolished state  there sound problems first two songs  looks like home movie concert tape  still  us n t  us  real treat  bowie  though constantly changing ever innovative  never quite captured energy charisma raw  edgy  yet refined perfection spiders  enjoy 
4,i dvd video n t much difference  dvd skip guitar solos though get back david   pause perfectly  if buy dvd though  make sure n t surround sound  it sounds much much better s flat together  although n t concert like d see today  s still entertaining  definitely classic  ziggy stardust spiders go together  i ve got friends n t know bowie  know ziggy stardust  this great band  wonderful character  wonderful songs  comes together despite picture quality  you definitely put watch  work something listen  it worth buy  especially love david bowie 
4,this wonderful documentary capturing bowie absolute prime musically creatively  the sound excellent throughout performances  my complaint limitationsmm film lenses used severely hampered quality images captured stage  quite often lenses issues processing extreme colors intensity lighting  seeing totally blown diffused even focus  too bad  it would nice see better pass restoration release bluray  overall i would recommend serious bowie fan music good pass  the surround mix fantastic  clear good amount punch  worth hear soundtrack  i already owned cd   
4,great lovers bowie  but iconic stuff  standard material folks interested lovers form
3,ahhhhhh seen show cleveland  lindisfarne opener  shame audio n t justice thx memories  still day best show ever       seen heard  got involved music industry still making music  producing shows  shame audio todays standards  still history
3,i bought video  shot bowie s peak  as another reviewer mentioned  quality sooo poor wish n t buy  with zillions hours high quality video bowie existing  sh  t released 
2,one first dvds i ordered first  i looked forward  but  making adjustments i could think i could make sound  video matter  quality acceptable  as much i adore david bowie  i n t even able watch even way  i notice favorable reviews vhs version film  too bad  potential 
3,this  honestly  worst concert dvd  i ve ever seen  it s crappy quality  the thingi really like live version songs  very horriblefilming  they must high something  they show theauidence  s good   hardly even see thembecause picture damn dark  bowie s last ziggy gigcould lot effort  bettergig  they show occasinal backstage scenes his costumes kind cool  here songs  intro    hang on to    ziggy stardust    watchthat    wild eyed boy from free cloud    all the youngdudes    oh you pretty things    moonage daydream    changes10  space oddity   my death   cracked actor   time  width of a circle   band introduction   let s spendthe night together   suffergate city   white light whiteheat   farewell speech   rock n roll suicide   endcredits 
3,when i originally saw concert tv teen  concluded blistering encore jean genie mick ronson assisted idol jeff beck  it looked like scene orchestrated vince mcmahon wrestling fame guitar slingers firing blazing riffs back forth  did bowie leave kind beck ola pay ola  did amazing ronson  like lighters bear  shine brighty concert  only david knows sure  there conclusion show without finale  why reissue yet still incomplete  check local boot legger missing cherry  deliberate omissions like fans deserve kind legal swapping discarded gems 
3,it was ok and i m speaking out  all pony pal books they almost never get into fights and they never have had to expierience really bad stuff such as divorce and pranks or sell one of their ponies it would be cool if theit would be jr pony pals withmimi  rosalie  if she ever gets a pony  eve  and pam s siblings also read the saddle club that s all i have to say 
3,this really neat little set perfect little hands  i half way expecting knife axe super flimsy plastic like dollar store stuff  s actually pretty sturdy  i gave product  stars binoculars blurry almost impossible look flashlight cheap  barely works  but everything else neat  year old seems love  especially compass watch  axe  
5,this horseshoe aweomse  i would like buy christmas presents  very well made good value 
5,this amazing book begins author exploring seven women feminine consciousness  s coming  role help reshape world  i n t tell eight people reached enlightenment   well path  spiritual journey discipline  the book ends interviwed saying similar things  concentrating four areas  exploring feminine consciousness  s important spiritual practices  need go beyond transcendence transformation everyday life  balanced way   finally re headed bringing feminine consciousness transformation  it heart felt gratitude author writing book 
5,this probably dad s favorite album simply s ridiculusness  some background  the bonzos  house band  monty python s predicessor  silly british tv show called  do not adjust your set   since house band  n t expect music serious  if listen closely lyrics  songs downright hilarious  i reccomend listening homework  though  i finished essay would ve nomally taken hour write  revise  edit  instead took  hours i listening gorilla  it s good leisure time  homework  in short  i love gorilla album 
5,if listen cd n t laugh loud  then jack  you are dead    better yet  buy entire collection  cd set called cornology  
5,i recently ordered chamae roseoz bottle receivd promptly item described i absolutely purchase 
2,we ordered expresso  color quite different  the lighter shade greenish grey  darker almost black  will better black grey scheme rather expresso scheme   so upsetting 
3,i saw movie  stunned soundtrack  particularly fact five songs newfoundland band great big sea  generally played cafe   i extremely disappointed  therefore  discover none songs made onto cd  fabulous songs  songs crucial part overall mood movie 
4,i enjoyed movie much loved sound track  i really enjoyed would recommend everyone enjoys music celtic sound 
2,this book adds little online documentation provided tomcat team seems published hurry first tomcat book place  e g  p chapter  read   in next chapter  cover securing web application using secure sockets layer  ssl    well  chapter whole book  the chapter  goodwill promises chapter integrating xml apache soap project tomcat  again  chapter covering basics  book good job  said  provided ducumentation well 
2,the author preface says expects book complete reference tomcat  i would say falls far short objective i expected meaningful look tomcat  most information presented already available standard tomcat distribution  there attempt go beyond surface  it seems author rush get book published  rather spend time providing insight tomcat there proper introduction terms concepts related tomcat  i n t expect introduction servlets jsp  all i ask clear concise definitions various tomcat components breakdown config files if intrested finding tomcat stick looking information online  it time well spent 
2,talk disappointed  this book took superficial approach basic concepts result book might useful brand new deploying servlet based web applications useless learn nuts bolts  i bought make sure i d know correctly configure tomcat production environment book added little i d already learned reading documentation 
2,it s shame book poorly written  misleading title  the java tomcat community struggling time tomcat  trying desperately gain sort useful insight horrid online documentation  then along comes long awaited manual could easily saved day thousands sysadmins problem  book provides next useful information integration apache tomcat  it s bad enough information comes nearly book  what s worse  integration chapter pages long  goes  fact  n t even go far  documentation s provided online this book huge disappointment  far better served picking good o reilly book servlets jsp etc  figuring tomcat installation webapp deployment issues 
2,this book good beginner  it scratches onlythe surface topics  at times  i thought itwas work progress  reason  author wasin hurry get book published  the diagrams awfulis many places  the total content book could easilysqueezed less pages most stuff explained easily available theform articles written onjava com author 
1,the book seems give detatiled example install windows platform  s  i install linux  there detail get ground 
2,does little scratch surface areas would use novice ken
3,the information somewhat helpful  it far comprehensive lacks depth  it helped get basic tasks done left lot questions unanswered  there definitely lot room superior book subject along  i d like see book tomcat i n t stand reading online documentation start finish  online docs good looking particular info 
2,if new jsp servlet development know struct log4j  might need  but wanted get depth detail tomcat  forget 
3,i ve using tomcat six months  i ve figuring little little use online material imho lacking  i hoping get good book explain information easily learned product doucmentation instead tomcat focused book  i got decent jsp servlet overview  coverage web site configuration  descriptions different tomcat features short chapters covering apache struts  log4j  soap not i bargained  useless resource either

1,i bought book first printed hoping insight tomcat worked  design decisions  architecture etc  etc what i got nothing rehash online documentation a complete waste money utterly worthless  if copy hang nail 
2,this book  superficial  only small part configuration tomcat covered  plus  certainly outdated today 
1,the price packets several times expensive buying  count package grocery store  the reason i agreed store stopped carrying item  
1,tom lehrer said political satire died day henry kissinger given nobel peace prize  thus cinematic satire film oscar best adapted screenplay  there story worth  it adds nothing understanding human condition  reviewers seem imply value lies   merely series sketches search coherent theme fails qua entertainment  mckellan redgrave best  prosaic material work save boring film whose raison d etre escapes ever increasing somnolent viewer  that oscar screenplay says far academy s often appalling decisions anything else  perhaps  like american presidency  lobby money buy anything 
1,only actor worth hoot thing b fraser  mckellen redgrave s performances pitiful  redgrave acted like skit character snl  i ve seen mckellen s effeminate  snobby british character zillion times  if bored gourd  watch claptrap 
5,although i reservations movie  due whole homosexual theme  i soon put aside differences  truly enjoyed movie  it extremily touching  ending sad sweet  i liked clay able put aside somewhat unenjoyable relationship james whale  remember fondly many years afterward the issue movie deals  something controversal subject many years  i enjoyed bill condon able portray problem senstively emotionally  a terrific drama brendan fraser fans  ever wanted find love acceptence 
4,without doubt  appreciate fine  character driven films find much like bill condon s critically acclaimed biopic legendary horror director james whale  ian mckellen delivers finest performance date charming  charismatic director whose best days behind along lynn redgrave doting maid brendan fraser young gardener strikes quick quirky friendship whale  the beauty film lies narrow scope small palette locations supporting characters  giving film intimate feel close confines three major players along subtlety interaction on disc ll get poorly transferred trailer ho hum minute featurette offers little way value  also disappointing lack proper dolby  audio track  ll get shiny disc paltry  mono job 
4,i finally watched movie read many reviews found good  i really loved learning james whale life  look psyche  this movie become new favourites s portrayal gay s life simply one dimensional character  whole person happened gay 
5,i purchased movie i huge brendan fraser fan  movie moving i somewhat forgot brendan became captivated story  i ended watching second time  it wonderfully acted  i think s brendan s best work ever ian mckellen outstanding movie  for anyone looking movie move wanting friends family see   it s powerful drama  one i watch  i m glad collection 
4,good movie  especially enjoy old universal horror movies  knew little  frankenstein  director james whale  movie gives much insight 
3,gods monsters perfect movies  the letterboxing  dvd  however  absolutely ruins  many little things  ie  teacups  arm movements  etc  gone  gone  gone  watch vhs 
4,nudity could left  it exact impact without  redgrave absolutely wonderful  although i agreee ian mckellan s oscar nod  performance mediocre compared jim carrey s delightful performance the truman show  the discrete nudity downfall well made written film 
2,i often buy seen movie  especially reviews glowing  thankfully  i rented first  i n t see special movie family friendly  boring drifted  my tastes go movie watch large family  this n t qualify moreover  i n t see usual devises make back say   wow  well written   i rented academy award  i n t agree gotten award worthy competitors rent first i  maybe ll agree professional reviews 
5,every comes movie reminds entertainment intelligent emotional experience  this poignant story loneliness friendship everything go  ian mckellen s performance memorable brendon fraser best  script  direction dialogues brilliantly handled newcomer director bill condon  it appeal everyone movie life death  loneliness friendship  the widescreen edition remarkable 
5,what surprising movie  first  screen s great performances ian mckellen  s stunning revelation brendan fraser great depth power actor pretty much wasted films  except terrific comedy   this film dvd marvel  the images crisp clean  sound clear distinct  music score carter burwell finest recent years  subtly entwining psychological makeup characters storyline   gods monsters  movie rare depth directorial eloquence  i recommend highly enough thinking moviegoers 
4,the film interesting dvd capitalizes opportunity informing viewer real facts behind  fact tion  story director james whale  unfortunately production special features seemed bit rushed  unproduced   apparently  according director  much way film  interesting insight world indie film leaves audience wondering glorious heights might reached filmmakers ample time resources recognize vision  nonetheless  beautifully acted packaged piece   well worth time attention 
4,the excellent performaces mckellen  redgrave  surprise  fraser  along insightful script direction bill condon make year s best films  it makes discover director james whale s  whose story  works beyond franenstien  i would love see journey s end   the road back    unnfortunatly dvd  special edition  bit disappointing  the audio commentary bill condon good  however i wish members cast involved  particularly mckellen   the minute documentary shed much light director james whale s tormented life work  the new frankenstien dvd much better regard  other trailer   extras  mention  gods monsters certainly worth rental  think twice purchasing  collector s edtion   
3,like movie much    stars played well think s best scenario ever seen    thx
3,the bottom line  everyone seems love gods monsters i think s duty inform interesting first half kinda flies handle hard to believe final act  acting fine concept interesting execution rather spotty  
3,it appear movie last days historical english gay hollywood film director the acting good  theme i like movie he makes passes college student ex marine gardener lynn redgrave good maid cook character actor the english seem  like catholic priesthood  real problemwith homosexuality 
2,this movie n t grab  point  i usually tremendous fan mckellan s work  like fraser s style  however  neither really clinched film  the scene stealer blas film redgrave  playing mckellan s hungarian housekeeper  the film covers recollections director original frankenstein film  mckellen finds confidante fraser  yard pool boy  while recollections could riveting  somehow delivery flat  find saying  cares   time  without forming affinity either character s plight  yes  mckellen openly gay actor  yes  fraser bit nude scene  s reason run buy film  rent slow saturday afternoon  it s watchable  n t re watch 
5,one recent films i anticipated good exceeded expectations sir ian mckellen performs well  the real surprise brendan fraser  thanks bill condon s amazing screenplay  fraser study expressive innocent contrast mckellen s anguished self defeated character  make point get  best screenplays consist strong dialogue  pacing  narrative  the oscars usually accurrate 
5,i thought i already reviewed product  i love moviei hate site updates sites n t keep ratings notes items 
4,i say movie much better i expected be i really enjoyed ending meaning behind befriending  strong type  guy   get movie u wont disappointed  
5,there much love film s hard know begin  ian mackellan brilliant director james whale  brandon fraser perfect  monster   lynn redgrave wonderful long suffering maid hanna  the three perfect ensemble compliment perfectly there many layers dimensions story  each time i watch  i discover love  i heartily recommend movie although everyone understand deeper meaning  and s definitely homophobic  open mind love 
4,as usual  kevin bacon great job playing someone nice guy yet manages give character humanity  you tell researched character s profession brad renfroe good job s sad life cut short life choices  he promising actor the story entertaining enough  i n t get boy s attraction callista flockhart s character  she plays pretty drab inside 
5,this film sweet sense get know karchy goes realizes america isnt necessary place get away telling lies meets idol billy magic personally i would recommend movie great performances brad renfro  kevin bacon calista flockhart

5,this complete thorough examination life playing career baseball icon  the author done commendable job separating facts fanciful fictions grown surrounding george herman ruth  while home run record surpassed  i still think argue ruth greatest baseball player considers addition hitting abilities ruth outstanding pitcher  he shifted outfield managers determined could greater value everyday player rather pitching every third fourth day 
4,i really enjoyed book  it gave behind scenes look greatest baseball player time  not i enjoy baseball stories  i found stories unique personality ths amusing 
3,this book started really well  kept attention throughout  however ms glass seems rushed ending  the story develops characters well  believable entertaining  i thought climax rushed  everything happens last chapter  seemed like wanted finish book without finishing story  i would recommend book easy read

2,i read book result reading reviews site  while story held interest i see  i thought writting corny dialogue phony juvenille  eventually sexual overtones became annoying unrealistic  perhaps author would better success  young adult  writter   despite sex  book came across 
4, s nice bra support  like s full coverage  s pretty much victoria secret bras  paid less   
3,the wbc genesis commentary  vol   wenham  follows series  format  technical material first  scholarly textual evaluation criticism  finishing commentary  for diligent hebrew scholars  first section overkill  for hold high view scriptural inspiration  documentary theories sympathetic comments late editing found int middle section frustrate lessen credibility  the commentary solidly done  agreeing every point  i find generally helpful worth consulting 
5,gordon wenham produced first class exegetical commentary genesis  the bibliographies cover full range topics authors  for section biblical text  begins textual notes quite valuable familiar ancient languages  next addresses issues form structure  finally  provides verse by verse commentary  in process  addresses various approaches viewpoints even handed fair way 
5,i imagine less user friendly layout word biblical commentary series  the series uneven  occasionally goes overboard literary source criticism  but up to date  critical commentary genesis shelves  best 
4,my daughter loves  the thing i wish would change would make package recyclable 
1,mary daheim obviously not hip replaced would known do need walker wheel chair get around physical therapy starts day surgery  also obnoxious renie sounds like real jerk screaming whatever hospital  one sure wash hair shower shoulder surgery either  this first book series i ve read n t know i read another silly  mary daheim research books quit putting fast    
4,everyone little leery hospitals  good cheer good reason make judith renie nervous  two high profile patients recently died fairly routine surgery  judith needs hip replacement  renie scheduled shoulder surgery  the night operations  well known ex football player next room well  since nothing think s going  judith renie put minds solving mystery find aabout strange things happening good cheer hospital this best series produced long time  hospitals naturally creepy really strange  the setting hospital isolated snow storm really adds drama  enjoy  i 
3,i always get excited i seem mary daheim s author new bed and breakfast mystery   least i always used get excited   suture self  takes place hospital  ultimate bed breakfast  cutsey improbable title implies  the largest problem location  might guess  s difficult three murders floor  various characters wander room confess  observe hit run hospital window  it n t work  and humor daheim usually exhibits n t work either  s strained artificial  filled weak puns plays words i m saddened see daheim turn weak product  formulaic novel based past work  unlike hospital set  novel sterile lacking credibility color 
1,an anemic effort someone touted cover best selling author  i d go back check titles gave status instead reading book very weak characters  obvious mystery  too convenient plot devices every page  cheap shocks make feel stupid find  characters literally fall hospital room spill guts  confessions  bed ridden mystery solver   and someone gall compare miss marple   she blushes modestly   search little farther amazon i m sure ll find something worth time  try janet evanovich katy munger  their stuff treat re adult reader child 
4,judith mcmonigle flynn needs hip replacement  coincidentally time cousin renie shoulder surgery  they little apprehensive admission good cheer hospital  seems rash deaths basically healthy people recently surgery hospital  there rumor takeover good cheer plenty quirky hospital employees well relatives deceased gives judith long list suspects  her husband working case dealing homeless people judith suspects connection case s working  undaunted surgery  judith travels around hospital wheel chair  usual  manages solve mystery police  this another enjoyable book bed and breakfast series 
2,i read bed  breakfast thru   i kept hoping mary daheim might get back groove  not  somewhere along line  books lost charm  renie developed severe overbite  prominent front teeth  heavily focused last books  she gotten quite attitude  making difficult get along anyone  added renie bill s ridiculous storyline dressing bunny  books  obsessed stuffed gorilla  they even go far oscar gorilla held hostage negotiate  please  gertrude s acided tongue never entertained  realistically would put verbal abuse heaped throughout years  judith turned doormat on plus side  i read alpine series  far delightful  but i pass bed  breakfast series 
3,arrived pretty box  the silver cz s bit bigger i would liked  made seem little costume y

3,proctor gifted writer done wonderful job characters night   they dimensional truly know inside  the plot different twist unexpected  thus far i would rate       but i really hate books written outback  aboriginies  etc   and took great deal enjoyment  of course entire book works setting must  if like australia  ll probably like book  i lot skimming

3,okay  i agree n t carlton s best work  it s clearly cd intended commercial radio air play building guitarist s reputation  but  n t necessarily mean music bad  n t  in fact   good for  best cd two  put tracks   it s piece i really like s fun listening carlton back years  the rest cd n t exciting s listenable i like  roll  title track on hand re looking start carlton s solo music  need start something else  something earlier catalog  but re fan i d say get  keep expectations line cd  safe  commercial sounding  excellently played recorded  and s still carlton still manages least 
1,1  yes   i larry carlton fan   i ve seen numerous times years  as baseline  favorite albums earlier efforts etc   my favorite song   strikes twice mulberry street   which makes frustrating   great musician turn   completely boring music  i n t understand i guess i never  the bottomline   tend like neutral  tepid music  ie background music    fine  otherwise  skip effort via larry pray comes back life puts good album 
2,larry carlton fine guitarist  fails show talent latest release  the session musicians far prominent mask playing  i would love hear larry carlton solo  bass drum 
2,the elevator arrived  mr carlton s latest effort lackluster unimaginative i frankly n t believe  he wonderful player years library full work  this album appears dedicated proposition raised pulse risky  it almost forced melancholy  riffs dull whole work seems stifled desire background music car something  what drag  
4,carlton  the veteran jazz guitarist s second release many years dissapoint  it best jazz albums i ve purchased heard year  this ten track cd plus bonus track full gems  especially cover eagles  i ca n t tell you why  r  b artist shai guest vocals track  it smooth jazz version  he covers steve winwood s  roll with it   if re fan carlton  fourplay jazz  check cd  it s carlton best 
2,i ve fan larry carlton quite time  i still listen  sleepwalk  album find vibrant came  larry always tasteful player bit edge make things interesting  this new album sounds much carefully drawn  the guitar far mix larry seems playing session album  the  selections vocals n t really add anything anyone looking larry carlton  i hope next album finds reaching bit taking chances

1,this movie ridiculously overpriced  the acting horrible  plot nonexistent  the dvd n t even much commentary track  i guess i learned lesson  never give rosie perez second chance 
3,when already  n t much go  two people already criminal tendencies start excite crimes   macho   you throw voodoo kidknapping  rape white collar crimes business  it exciting strange beginning  if immorality vicious crimes looking  may  stars  rosie perez believeable    
4,steve miller probably world s underated guitarist  he underated artist  your saving grace exception  the title track heavy emotion writen miller  shows talent tim davis backbone early stuff  the forcefull lovesong  little girl  civil rights motif  do n t let nobody  solid rock tracks hint blues lot attitude   baby s house  shows piano skills nicky hopkins well miller s strength vocalist  if miller s box set missing full version awesome song   motherless children  blues twing solid emotional base makes classic  while album short  good buy  for miller enthusist well worth  if  might start early stuff antholgy 
3,your saving grace first five steve miller band cd s gone print  it makes s reentry cd market japanese reissue  however  not remastered  none japanese pressings  they sound identical domestic releases available decade

4,this great baby record book  the pages thorough laid simply  i gave cousin loved  i gave four stars n t include pouch pocket page i saw liked many books  keep newspaper clippings  band hospital etc  otherwise great book 
3,of course i agree reviewers content book interesting  i read completely  despite painfully boring flatness prose  it might useful psychologist trying understand patient unpleasant love affair  ah yes  re stage   subdivision   sectiona  imagine mechanical drawing  say  exploded diagram pencil sharpener  call work art  glorious detail  exact descriptions  complete entire   but s work art creatively  to say svevo bridge george eliot james joyce misses totally art language created two 
4,this book whose relative failure made svevo abandon literary career decade two young irishman named james joyce happened upon tutoring old english realized greatness  it s wonderful story  future luminary resuscitating old  broken spirit gave impetus even pick svevo book  the confessions zeno   but  it engaging  biting  vivid story  told wit  grace style  but  usually  clearly pales later masterpiece  if given choice  i would definitely recommend zeno  still truly excellent read  the story liasons gone awry  psychological musings problems new creature  modern neurotic  spine story  provide sturdy support   even get better treatment next book 
5,dont  ahve mp3s say cd awesome   
5,this absolute best sailor moon right  not sailor moon sailor stars best season ever sonds greatest 
2,i bought ring ring size testing  quality problem  but something ring s center stone think let buyers know advance  i highly doubt material cz  cubic zirconia   through carefully observing x30 jewelers scope  refractive index center stone seems low    close glass cz  typically  cz refractive index around   and diamond    for know talking  let s put way  the center stone sparkle looks cloudy   i guess wont return since cheap  
3,this fun cd little much pop taste  first half album nothing candy singing bubblegum pop music  the second half latin feel  nice  this nice album give someone listens pop swears like jazz  but someone looking honest jazz cd  n t  i hope candy puts saxophone next album  lot less vocal 
3,displays soul dispenses drum bass  first even remotely jazz cd  i count  tracks would considered drum bass downtempo    my soul purchased strength my love alone flat best urban track i ve heard  other highlights cuts everyday people  december quirky freak out  do n t get wrong  candy blow mindy adair contact lessons  right my soul sounds like kraftwerk attempted make jazz cd   
4,this good cd  if i could stop playing finsbury park i could really enjoy songs even more very talented lady 
2,when i got product opened box  literature said use kind shower head valve turns flow  this filter housing plastic subject cracking bursting turn flow downstream filter that s kind shower head i  i like use valve feature  i really really wish egeneralmedical said  limited  online literature  and expect pay return shipping  restocking fee 
3,this probably fourth replacement cartridge i purchased  time include replacement rubber  o  ring seals cartridge housing  so i drip deal  not good 
5,i purchased system year ago dreading change filter  i hate changing filters anything s never easy manufacturer claims  i changed filter took  minutes  super easy  i love product  my skin n t itchy i shower anymore 
3,i would actually give book   stars  the reason i m giving stars concepts regarding evolution spiritual  though still retaining validity  seem somehow outmoded  in addition  writing style bit anachronistic  however author remarkable time  long ago  still much worth reading  he underrated  somewhat eclectic philosopher courageous enough question scientism day 
1,while dvd  fact  playable computer region player  image quality poor  scenes shot outdoors washed overexposed  rapid on screen motion cause image blur perceptibly  this gets worse film progresses  i got suckered buying clinker warnings difference regions posted prominently  however  i n t believe incompatibility entirely accounts poor performance product  looks behaves like poorly executed copy copy made company equipped  n t enough  produce high quality dvd 
5,what else say john wayne movie said  good fast service good movie 
4,i have seen this movie many times prior to buying it  i bought it on line as a package deal with  other dvd s  even walmart wanted to much money and i went to several before i found one  i like john wayne  but i bought it for the fonda acting  he plays the part well 
4,dvd newcomer  fort apache    looks great  minimal wear crisp black and white images  original nitrate elements  bugle brisk audio  the film  ironically  finds henry fonda playing maddeningly hawkish cavalry commander john wayne s humanistic officer willing risk peace justice the  single  dvd documentary exciting heartfelt film  shame  it include minute piece monument valley  covering ford s significant seemingly beneficial role indian reservation s history  the navajo  paid good wages appearances  called  giant soldier     i ve kissed babies politician   ford said   part vision world re small scheme things   film historian joseph mcbride says   i think  monument valley  gives dimension seriousness work intensified went along      
3,this part john ford trilogy i would consider outstanding classic  it s start class shines action desire it bad film originally filmed color studio pay money color  it n t last movie trilogy she wore yellow ribbon filmed studio agreed filmed color  turner decided bought film pay colorized  a great job done  unfortunately released video tape recorded ep mode  this big mistake little reason  thus movie i would give colorization  stars releasing ep i would give turner star
3,i ve always liked movie years ago i bought colourised vhs copy nyc  i amazed much better  i would say  tape ep speed  backs many would made colour producers forseen future  vhs  laserdisc dvd  the colour good even ep speed  imagine blu ray  i know fans movie prefer original b w  put blu ray two seperate discs recently  it s a wonderful life   those blue uniforms yellow stipes wonderful  the movie i would give  stars disapointing release s three 
3,as soon dvd available shipped arrived great shape  the blue ray version classic clearly better picture  i sorely disappointed full screen format  my older version  even though blue ray better field view  pan scan i think  closer widescreen  i must missed screen size per order movie 
4,fort apache  best westerns movies  henry fonda great crazy commander  john waynes knowlegable calvaryman part great balance fondas  the irish sargent confederate veteran stand  the apaches less villified usual  focus calvarys problems 
5,john ford john wayne teamed many films days hollywood western adventure among best horse operas ever made  set picturesque monument valley  favorite ford outdoor setting  movie tells life army outpost arizona unease officers enlisted command disgruntled  by the book lieutenant colonel  henry fonda excellent martinent alienates clashes wayne s captain york throughout film  differences exploding peace parley apaches ends rousing cavalry indian engagement near movie  ford s regulars  led ward bond  victor mclaglen hank worden among cast members  shirley temple john agar provide romantic angle proceedings  the black white cinematography archie stout striking richard hageman s wistful score among film s top notch production values 
3,the vhs fort apache i received url turner release  much earlier vidamerica product  different cover art  it s old s label cover reading   the affordable collectables  thirty four ninety five       numeric  the box sealed sides  to extract tape opens top flap  this mids recording sp mode  linear mono audio track  hifi   clear faint hiss  film stock used unrestored often shows snow specks  scratch lines edit breaks  picture high contrast lacks subtle detail  an average product best  watchable  though 
3,this famous western ever made  henry fonda plays commanding officer acts like custer with results custer  i find henry fonda character unpleasent watch to point unblieveable  it good john ford cavalry movies  my advice skip movie watch she wore yellow ribbon  rio grande  
3,the scenery west great  open vast quiet clean i area city  helps calm center helps better understand characters plot lines better 
5,john ford greatest directors ever step movie set  he proficient many genres acclaim westerns  especially starring john wayne  fort apache ranks among best offerings  great direction two super stars peak powers  duke wayne hank fonda play contrasting characters share thing common  call duty  the scenery glorious pacing sublime highly recommended film

2,i seen several versions emma enjoyed  however  least favorite  the actress plays emma rather grated nerves i enjoy performance  i would recommend 
3,it s ok  i n t really enjoy many actors  sets  scenery n t great i felt like strayed book unneccesary ways it s worth collector jane austin movies  least three much better versions 
4,i chose version  emma  free amazon prime   emma    mr knightly  especially likeable characters  what comes across poignantly economic social need early nineteenth century women marry order survive avoid spinsterhood governess positions  the eponynous emma convincingly severe throughout series  i recommend production good rendering original novel  outlook people time  interesting taste s acting styles 
3,this emma follows book faithfully  means plenty could cut  the main problem lead actors  they much old year old emma year old mr knightley  if see emma light funny sweet  like spirit novel  get a  e bbc production starring kate beckinsale 
3,i watched  i believe  emmas available  this i enjoyed least  emma n t seem lovable  though i felt like i could relate better i starting recognize subtle facial expressions later movie  i thought mr woodhouse interesting character movie  i liked mr elton  this movie n t make mr elton seem like bad guy  probability seems realistic  i thought mrs bates pretty good and record  though i m expert  definitely changes dialogue details movie 
3,this  chick flick   i watched least dozen times  i like newer version better fills evening well  i enjoy period pieces constantly amazed piece still claims facination years  i fan jane austen i several versions works  i read books well 
1,honestly  i m shocked production received high praise  i enjoy book  ugly  drawn out thing bored tears  production proves important adapt book screen  rather pedantically act scene by scene  word by word the sets bad  sound worse  i ve seen better looking costumes high school productions i enjoyed donald eccles mr woodhouse  fiona walker mrs elton  debbie bowen harriet smith  loathed doran godwin emma  emma supposed beautiful  weird looking  i know sounds bit shallow  movies visual medium  poor godwin long  scrawny chicken neck slightly pop eyed  she creeped out austen fans probably watch  say watched  i recommend borrowing rather paying money 
1,took hours remove old finish oak table piece looks cloudy dull  i disappointed need use something bring table life 
2,i thought prime purchase slow cost high    waste time money  i drive town get items i get project done time 
3,sure s typical genetic mutations loose horror novel  creatures actually pretty inventive far first book made feel little ookie picturing  department s step  however  compared rest story amount monster action lacking  most book centers main characters trying decide truly love  easily  pages could dropped make tighter compact enjoyable read  instead tends drag shift focus disinteresting thoughts main characters far much  character developement fine  case instead developement things stuck repeat  overall  yes  i liked book  editing done 
1,i toothpaste ada seal approval nowhere found tube  it n t whiten either 
2,this book called  white girl culture    hardly ethnic looking girl book  lots suburban teen age girls looking like trying fit  nothing really insightful  new surprising  some photos bit interesting overly self conscious subject photographer   sorry images easy forget   border teasing male viewers    save money wait video 
3,girl culture s concept women interesting  the photos show women see  some really great revealing photos 
2,while photographs lauren greenfield beautiful  i found subjects chose predictable poor representation girlhood american girls  come   fat camp  anorexics  models  spring break photos good measure  greenfield s book would ve groundbreaking early s  subjects done over again it appears greenfield looking something profound subjects  the results feel labored  almost eager  though photos invisable caption attached  there neither spontaniety  profundity way frames subject there photos i like  for example  photographs young girl s quinceanera   sweet  fifteen  lovely refreshing  i enjoyed accompanying text  girls talk life 
3,this book ok  i would consider gift woman  as male reader  i found book bit boring photojournal  stories mildly interesting  not addition personal library  read donate opinion 
3,i girls book  i lauren photographed  there photograph story go along  why  because i teen buzz cut worked youth organization peer counselor  this fit theme book  idea i controlled consumer culture worked serve concept rest omitted  but hey  i like clothes i must mindless drone beast consumer culture  i book i think admirable  unfortunately i think shows side i curious rest girls portrayed negatively  this book makes point needs heard  it warns us dangers materialism portrayal women media  but i sad lauren shown side  simply blots make sure proves point 
1,i found exact product   today walgreens  this price  however  even regular price less  i feel some many mega diaper packs amazon good deal

5,if enjoy movies make uneasy yet keep watching voyeueristic mix repulsion fascination  look   s ve looking for brando considered legend  movie proof   acting  small word describe performance gave here pain  confusion  lust  grasping redemption slithers fingers   s right  folks this movie carousel torment  there s anonymous person riding next  laugh  keep crying 
4,it s hard believe  prime  considered maybe greatest picture ever made  it n t n t  and yet  barbieri s score storaro s cinematography still delight ear eye  although see camera s reflection window pane last scene   regarding sex  s much said  in fact  lot said little seen  brando gives  performance lifetime   case  seeing  superman   probably true  maria schneider   jean pierre laúd execrable mássimo girotti steals show brando s funny you should ask rival  all  much ado   butter 
2,marlon brando marvelous actor  please someone else write dialogue  on many different occasions film need hear pigs  i never understood movie lauded much  i decided give another chance  the dialogue simply absurd  who talks like  the relationship brando young french girl s  m   opinion  themes explored better attractively    weeks   if re looking nudity graphic sex  n t find either  the sex scenes far  occur reaction likely  oh  my eyes    a film without writer recipe disaster  really shows  skip  you re missing thing 
4,  fired  fired i i og wer adgf faerb asdb  okn dswlelkb dlf twd  i oo peradts sdg sodmr  bye 
3,the film uneven  every scene involving brando taking immediate plunge energy interest  fortunately  lot brando  brando absolute best  broken  brooding  continuously near tears violence  wracked obscene despair  one moment particular  toys  bored  old harmonica  suddenly breaks weeping like little boy  leaves utterly moved empty  three stars film overall  five marlon brando s wonderful  gutsy performance 
5,i remember seeing movie first time billion yrs ago thinking  so this superb actor   brando  playing expat paris despair wife s recent suicide  never seems acting  never seems aware camera audience  never seems consider others view role movie  unbelievable the film shocking first made  especially graphic  time  unusual  sexual scenes  still makes viewers squirm bit  odd almost voiceless relationship maria schneider self serving either  it s dispassionate anonymous sex  meant band aid wound painful dealt way super  super  super 
1,i never saw movie first came film  i thought i would buy  it worst movie i ever saw life i movie buff  the acting storyline horrible  in nudity shots looks like wearing black bear skin rug private parts  do n t waste money 
1,unless thinks film lots female nudity  art   skip  it s stupid  sexist  pretentious  dialogue wretched  n t care characters   lot things reviewers already said 
2,when movie first came  talk town  mainly nudity  i believe  the plot silly brando s acting awful 
4,i wanted long time see movie i n t dissapointed  interesting subject  great cinema 
4,the movie good  i thought would  entire movie french  prepared read subtitles  it took several tries watch way  my fault  i known 
1,i though film terrible  brando mumbled french plot unrealistic  i purchased film see sexualism changed years  since touted first expicit sexual scenes 
2,there was not really that much sex in the film  there brutal language butr not much sex  this film said  i love stories fan like   dont get  dont word
1,just finished watchingrd time last years  i try give ltip another chance every severalyears  hoping something changed maturedso i  get  bit better  well  i n t n t  it still seems like indulgent  boring mess  yes  brando act yes  maria schneider fantastic year old body  what add  nothing  a  hour waste time  a movie totally emoty story emotional core  i like lot stufffrom lates earlys  sitting tedium like art indicative  thankgod ve moved  oh  congratulations otherwise usually excellent bertolucci starraro accomplishing impossible making paris look ugly 
5,ohmijesus  arriviste paris lets go branch grab onto thinks established importance  brando raped faerie queen vivien leigh a streetcar named desire bereaved  many varied way badly cloaked toxic ambition  this break telephone via email better yet vanish  this precursor fatal attraction  i think movie supposed annoying  off putting unattractive  his dead wife daughter french resistence member  could important movie 
1,do n t waste precicous time pretentious tripe  the acting self conciously artsy overwrought  brando s character abusive jerk  schneider s character n t get enough  spare nonsense please  if nudity bag  rent playboy video instead  ll thank keeping losing  hours mess 
1,brando favorite actor s known taking anyrole great job  he great job film walked away  i admirer  edge  movies themes hard   however  film leaves viewerwith thought  bertolucci filthy  lecherous old   i rarely hate movie bankrupt  purely perverted film awful  hope brando made lot money least 
4,marlon brando extraordinay actor  see movie  great mr brando performance i great expectations movie  but i m little disapointed  i think picture erotic superlative degree   good drama story erotic content  i like movies erotic content the lover  in realm senses  david lynch s lost highway   well i like movies erotic content tha considered bizarre david lynch s blue velvet  heavenly creatures  among others 
2,feeble  inarticulate struggling deep without knowing wants deep  it fast forwarded without anything missed  alas  poor brando  knew well 
4,marlon brando mrevel  very unorthodox acting style  the movie  however  contains lots sexual scenes must kept away children  very unusual story 
2,i went film thinking i would see unorthodox film involving sex  i ve seen many films could fit description  happiness  todd solondz  romance  catherine breillat  unlike films  i failed see point one the sex scenes extremely grotesque graphic perverse nature  especially scene involving sodomy i n t say i would reccommend film anyone  the reason gets  stars  i think marlon brando convincing entertaining  i failed see point film whole therefore i give good rating 
2,i saw film special screening late s art house cinema minneapolis  the film leave lasting impression  unlike films i saw around time frame  i hardly remember single detail  its like get amneisia film  especially trully great work art  but since i barely recall seen last tango  leaves impression film great work art urband legand makers would 
1,i n t understand anyone like trash  it long  plotless  besides whole wife commiting suicide thing i would ve i married paul   random time i asking what f     i understand shocking time  especially butter scene otherwise  huge waste time  its amazing many people say great film brando  mumbling psycho terrized young woman  they absolutely no chemistry time  i idea going  overrated  overrated  overrated   hours life ll never get back 
1,this worst show i ve ever seen  do n t waste money buying  your time better spent cleaning gutters watching tripe i would rated show minus stars possible

3,this interesting movie good actors explicit plot it worth seeing marlon brando s great performance this good movie people trashy romance however  n t audiences compelling fascinating film adults very powerfull 
3,i looking foward seeing movie reading reviews i dissapointed i finally watched  the movie overlong drags although brando great scences movie isnt great  save money rent 
3,  last tango paris  curious mixture brilliance tedium  brando s acting finely honed  direction cinematography striking atmospheric  the best parts film  several scenes lovers  brando s monologue dead wife  darkly haunting the problem  however  memorable scenes separated long stretches stupendous boredom  the entire subplot jean pierre leaud weak annoying  much dialogue throughout movie atrocious  sort rambling dreck might expect college student trying sound  deep   it s film s editor incapable distinguishing real emotion sophomoric posturing simply left everything final print rent buying possible  reactions film vary wildly 
4,i m going break trend life time amazon comment actual item question blu ray disk movie  last tango paris  movie  the good news film subtle remastering blu ray studio sensitive source material keeping original palette movie without making look artificial hi def  as long n t black levels set high n t disappointed  sound big improvement mono dts remastering job making important aspect dialogue crystal clear  no extras trailer i m afraid 
2,faded color millions artifacts problems dvd  hopefully remastered soon 
3,i seen movie  it oldie i thought i would buy hype received  it so so movie today s standards  i guess i brando fan  he always seemed moody  much like james dean  this movie exception  i would recommend movie friend 
3,i thought movie n t bold i thought going  i think people like  however  movie certainly moments  eulogy brando gives wife  eventual divulging personal information jeanne  i love line   i m still good stickman  even i n t kids   i time guy like could walk joint like  pick girl like call bimbo   also  i think college guys seats paul balls say  repeat     n t give away  all  i think definitely people enjoy film  i m still deciding i 
1,finally saw much vaunted last tango paris  on dvd case  reviewer squeals   the erotically powerful movie ever made   yes  oh  erotic  marlon brando uses stick butter prepare girlfriend   well  let imagination soar  its clear every single reviewer gave good review must ve paid handsomely  to  words like  vacant     nihilistic     empty   instantly effortlessly leap mind  quite possibly  over damn hyped  contentless  worthless film cinematic history  i m appalled beyond words 
3,this movie overrated  the plot quite weak  i find erotic all there fair amount sex  characters paul  marlon brando  jeanne  maria schneider  insufficiently developed  we learn paul s wife recently killed  affair appears driven boredom  escapism  chance  what characters feeling  animal attraction   brando s acting excellent  weak plot  seems waste  the cinematography nice  lots darkness 
2,this overrated movie ever made  even s standards  i n t see hoopla  marlon brando usual brooding self  the girl extremely beautiful  even naked entire movie  i understand anyone considers cinema masterpiece 
5,we know shakespeare  review writing required  however  i would like say everyman s library series worth getting  unlike omnibus editions  riverside shakespeare   actually portable n t need table hold reading  the everyman s library series good hardbindings  conveniently sized carry around  illuminating extensive introductions  the typeface used old  letters large easily readable  something concern editions  tragedies  volume contains  hamlet  othello  king lear  machbeth

5,this entertaining anything allowed  avoid operating heavy machinery listening and n t listen asleep ll wake floor wondering came elevated 
2,i picked into wilderness accident thought best books i d read  i counted days dawn distant shore released found  best  disappointing  truth told  i found story farfetched  characters  seemed alive into wilderness  flat  instances  plain unlikeable  voyage boring  absolutely nothing book caught interest    strange  i found first book captivating terms developing storyline elizabeth nathanial book s historical context  i still look forward next installment  primarily s set back hidden wolf story belongs  i n t counting days release i n t invest hardback edition 
5,i liked  better first  i think  although i go re read  i especially liked way characters developing complex people  the scenes wonderful  i say i m glad n t leave scotland  too much scotland days love stories  do n t people realize s wet cold time  i m looking forward next installment back ny frontier  give mosquitos scotsmen anyday i theory reviews call book boring  five  i think   there three reasons mind call boring  somebody glued pages together  re brain dead  ve got something author  i suspect reviews written boring person  a vendetta  sour grapes  oxygen deprivation  who knows 
2,i hoping find another series would similar diana gabaldon s books  i disappointed  i still found anyone writes like gabaldon  i ll make short sweet i think donati developed characters well could  i wanted story wrapped around elizabeth nathaniel  instead  much story came hannah s point view  i realize probably due fact hannah s character built upcoming book  i interested  elizabeth s character developed well  i felt into wilderness dawn distant shore  nathaniel strong character hero image i would liked  i feel passion two i hoped  even ending weak 
2,i hoping would great sequel  disappointed  the characters  except hanna develop  nathaniel elizabeth beginning relationship first book characters well developed  two dimensional book  that said i await next book i trust ms donati continue story without destroying characters 
1,i got library boy i glad i n t waste money buying  i might done based donati s first novel  i sooo disappointed  this snoozorama say least  i guess i hope improvementrd novel  this novel sooooooo slow boring  daniel  boots  chemistry disappointing
1,it s good thing i read into wilderness first i never would bothered read another books  i read  i admit i  skimmed  last  it definite sleeper 
2,i found sequel big disappointment pales comparison donati s first book  this time around  characters bordered boring  plot lines forgetable donati s sweeping prose sadly absent  i thought overall tough read  hopefully next page turner like first 
2,the story falls ever gets started  it n t convince course action possible nathaniel try rescue father  mother sense god gave goose would newborn babies dangerous trip  i know sacajawea went much harder trip pregnant  book needed convince  didn t the adventures dangers thrown us fasst furiously  we given much chance enjoy peaceful spots anticipate fear next obstacle  it s boring way laundry list problems boring reader n t whether characters get  or n t really believe plot first place 
1,i loved into wilderness  this author  it boring  the characters dull whole book dragged  i definitly borrow next book library 
2,into wilderness absolutely top notch maybe expectations high dawn distant shore  this story contained little action far much gossip  these wonderful outdoorsmen  women  confined rocking ships pages  i homesick mountains hannah  i love ms donati s characters i uncomfortable oversea adventure  i hope brings home next installment  if i n t read first book i would never finished  plot much stretch  bonners terrific i know happened 
5,i n t enjoy much first  i usually think first book series best anyway  all excellent series  recommend 
1,i enjoyed rest series  i found book boring compared rest  much story spent ship  i feel characters introduced developed well  the books series much better 
2,after falling love nathaniel elizabeth into wilderness  i thrilled continue series  much dismay  book live expectations  is coincidence gabaldon s voyager book  set mainly upon high  least favorite author s series  hmmm  the thing kept going promise third book lake the clouds  the book worth reading  n t get wrong  especially continue series  the scotland thing seemed unnecessary  i would happier d stayed north america  oh well  artistic license 
5,i felt first book series started little weak definitely grew strength novel progressed  however  i enjoyed  dawn distant shore  start finish went purchase titles series right away  my complaint book kindle edition 
5,the kind book makes turn phone ignore kids  those two reviewers said  boring   i m wondering read book  i suppose need nuclear explosion like keep happy  what i like  interesting characters challenging situations  ve got abundance the first good  even better  more tightly written  miss donati stride  bring hidden wolf

3,great music many distracting sound effects  chirping birds  etc   not sure reggae mixing engineers insist adding sound effects music   often ruin great album   free africa  much better 
3,i high hopes virgin reissue i slightly disappointed  the majority songs lack certain punch even though musicianship typical late s jamaica top notch flawless  the twinkle brother s output unique world reggae sense s lp s seem stronger s lp s  if locate copy mid s stunner  underground  pick instead 
5,the powerful melodic music virginia city really stands today s soundtracks rolling drums string chords  oddly  volume disk rather low  enjoy best movie music 
4,not official nfl product saved money quality good enough  this product keep head warm show team pride

5,not great scare halloween movie scareathon  great bargain excellent condition  thank
3,started pretty good  then gets kinda silly  monsters  get story  had pretty scary moments 
3,overall  i thought pretty good horror movie  it begins dramatic opening scene  moves group young women adventurers exploring rather unusual cave  the succeding scenes cave climbing drag bit tension gradually developes action gets exciting  horrific really interesting series highly dramatic frightening scenes involving  cave creatures  leading satisfying conclusion  the movie reminds another movie  the cave 
5,when the movie started i was not sure about what exactly was the plot about  and that really worked good for me  after a very shocking scene of an accident  six women decided to explore a cave and they find what true horror is  i was shocked and stuck to my sit from the beginning till the end of the movie  this movie is so good and well done  directed and edited  visual effects are outstanding  i wo n t tell anything else to avoid to spoil it when you watch it  but trust me  this movies is so good that now  i will follow closer all works by director neil marshall  something you need to know is that the movie has won  important awards british independent film award  best director  neil marshall    british independent film award  best technical achievement    empire award  best horror movie  and has  other nominations   the movie is a total success  thumps up for neil marshall
4,this great movie horror film buff  not provide viewer guts  gore  blood love  explores real fears  clostrophobia  lonliness  betrayal  the movie good job making monsters seem somewhat human viewer almost feels sense sorrow creatures  unable see  evolved keen sense hearing underground caveworld  the ending n t typical horror film ending  heroine makes alive  that  alone  makes movie worth watching  i believe definitely worth money 
3,i saw movie drive in summer  perfect location movie like  it made even creepier watch outside  this movie brutal way wracks nerves  since never quite tell coming girls  the movie well shot considering location  it kept adrenaline pumping pretty much start finish  my complaint would many characters  cleary done enough kill  however  since least   characters distinguish  i emotional investment survival  must see horror movie 
1,poor acting  somehow rated   stars means   people rated idiots   scary parts total  acting horrifying though  scariest part movie long shot acting 
3,ok  got done watching the descent  kind disappointed  i rented b c reviews said scary so 
3,i assumed based book  the book much better  but movie good enough i got past expecting see something approximated book  it s worth rental  i would n t buy 
2,this movie really left cold  just could n t feel empathy characters  in fact  i kinda ended rooting monsters  i mean  cave  maybe venturing snack odd lost kid something  then adventure seeking bimbos show act suprised monsters make part buffet  hey  s s turf  huh  does nice moments suspense building  overall satisfying experience 
1,movie totally sucks  spent dollars still think wasted money  monsters fake took like hour anything happened  cool part begining guy died pole  thats  movie sucked dont buy 
2,i m usually horror movies  friend made watch  the descent   n t awful i thought would  the first half movie scarier rest  involves group six women exploring dangerous underground cave  being extremely claustrophobic  alone scary enough  however  women start hunted evil gollum like creatures live deep within cave  film takes turn worse  if re fan horror films  ll probably enjoy  the descent   s gruesome relatively scary  unlike ridiculous films currently pepper film genre  however  re like n t much type movies  definitely skip 
4,i started enjoying film  caving started deep surface  everthing starts getting creepy  tightand heart starts beating faster   adventurers tofind alone above average creepiness great direction puts movie othercave movies  should nt dissapoint extra features great   film good  you get see workand effort involved   and predator actors someof best around  enjoy 
2,some things good  bad  s run positive negative     side the setting underground cave couple moments make jump great concept    side story cast troll creatures tried seriously
2,almost full hour movie see movie even supposed  it s basically chick flick mutants last minutes  a horror movie  suspense  right  i guess new style  horror  i ll stick halloween  the exorcist texas chainsaw massacre basically   young women go mountains romp around together trying help friend loss family  consists first minutes movie  then finally go cave another minutes see s chasing wanting kill them  the mutants actually pretty neat n t see much like  sweet home alabama meets the gargoyles   if going advertise movie  scary    horror  make it like one  this chick flick  boo   tossed towards  stay away failed flick 
5,do buy film afraid small dark cramped spaces underground  this movie scare bee jabbers  other   s good thrill ride 
3,all needed bunch female egotists normally  executed  witless males movie like  they re heads   case  gaggle women decide go spelunking wind ripped shreds eaten piecemeal  intended  bunch hungry cave ghouls  descriptive term  what follows usual  offing  one by one adventurists  well   horrific scenes  guffaw   subtle  chortle    bloody  snicker    predictable  the spelunkers get  desserts     or  least ghouls  snort   blood  gore  screams  yelling  dismemberment  almost like watching old ozzie osborn concert  still entertaining horror flick 
4,yes  i know re thinking   another pick  one at a time horror flicks    and  but s  this movie actually made scream i m getting freaked writing dark  dark room  a bloodbath makes squirm   enjoying effect adrenalin rush  i claustrophobic  scenes made feel like i trapped rocky cave means escaping   the descent  broke basic major rules writing horror story  i n t tell  n t expect big twist travel never ending cave  fighting life  i d say rent first see buy   it s everyone 
5,before film film even close scaring  those films mentioned like watching teletubbies comparison film  i even consciously considered getting leaving cinema film i thought mind could n t handle tension  the action simply never stops starts  and  i n t spoil anything  first gory scene film  kind stuff n t even allowed  i never thought line could moved far 
1,yet another cheesy  cliche horror movie bunch dumb idiots  sometimes cool ways  nothing creative  nothing interesting  nothing original  stupid  i found hard laugh  yeah  creatures supposed blind  yet seem able see fine  dumb bimbos n t shut  i love  horror  movies like contradict every turn  the ending nothing laughable  it s hard draw line horror comedy  just pure joke  nothing  unless re another little mtv airhead finds kind crap scary entertaining 
1,this movie inch gonging  it like i cave watching  i plan sell blockbuster worthy collection the best part 
1,six macho bisexual chicks go caving find blind creepy underground things hey girls  n t cheap rent guide done cave   duhhh it s hard feel sorry dumb dumber dumber   
1,i love horror movies    but really horrible movie  gore looks fake lot appears cg although real props used  the actresses bad acting  cool b horror movie way either  suck  i know tons gore fans like may like movie trash  the only good thing about this movie is that it is only minutes long       guess i start go back asian import shop good horror 
3,the beginning little slow  pointless  middle ok far scary goes  there way much cursing sounds out of place  you n t believe makes seem fake  the  show down  let stupid ending  then ending stupid  i saw someone say  typical american happy ending   i n t understand since leaves movie happy  again  scary parts semi scare worthy  n t expect much resolution so called story 
2,the movie for me started when they got lost in the cave  i know they were trying to get you to know the charcters in the beginning  the dialogue could have been better  i did know one of the women was having an affair with one of her friends husband  i do n t think the charcters were strong enough  maybe they needed stronger actresses like sigourny weaver  linda hamilton even angela basset  but the movie had it s moments  it s good to watch  and it s good to put on when you have movie night with friends    
2,i watched second time year  i gave  stars science fiction merits would given star otherwise  a group women descend cavern n t get back due multiple stupid mistakes underground monsters  the main mistake way handled battery problem lanterns limited use becaue low battery life  instead alternating use  latern lit lead others following first person either used glow lights  many flaws mistakes led demise leaving unsympathetic plight  in addition ending confusing  interesting watch regardless 
1,i thought movie horror movies took forever get point    it reminded wolf creek i barely watched  these movies make something happen bad almost turn movie  finally get good parts pretty good  i wish story line could figured different way find creatures instead showing flashbacks people cheating women s husbands died blah blah blah blah blah  different storyline  characters  might awesome 
1,buyer beware  this version feel good hollywood formula ending  it original  redone give us viewers somewhat happy typical usa horror ending  resolution   pretty symbolic countries state i would say   get european version  i bought thing w o realizing redid  i buying original   
2,what major disappointment movie  it s bunch horrifying images little character developement  was i supposed women watch hope i find death scenes enjoyable  and exactly many centuries would humans become bat like beyond  i n t think would happened yet  and strong things  they large game wolves pound woman  time  whatever  the deleted scenes horrible deserved deleted  maybe deleted whole movie  i gave  stars movie somewhat watchable  what hell anyway  if would ended dream getaway i would said bad movie  actual ending made dislike even  i say waste less time get cave instead  i even liked dog soliders  happened 
5,this great powerful movie  it starts slow gets going  it great movie everything great  if horror monster like creatures like movie 
3,technically good  could perhaps benefitted slightly stronger plot  now neil marshall said pleased audiences n t quite know make ending   is dead  still cave  one creatures  i find interesting enough watch try figure things 
5,first spoilers i say theier build movie  hits fan  really hits fan i havnt feeling gut long time  since first alien film  felt similiar me this movie faint heart although gorry previous movies used effective  movie make feel unsettled  sure best creature film ve seen years  bring nerves sum i wont caves sure anytime near future  yes go ahead buy need waste money rent collection instant classic
3,i always wanted see movie i   i movie title bucket list
5,when watching movie  i feel like i m labyrinthine cave far underground  i find mountain crevasse viewing touching void  i found troglodytes believable well  the character development quite adequate  the acting fine  i found nothing detracted experience except last seconds  i n t give away   i find movie engrossing terrorific adventure 
3,this film s pretty good  nothing great bad either  imo  high ratings movie got partly due lack quality horror films makes look excellent comparison  but scary  film uses lot typical  cheap boo type scare scenes n t get jumpy unless re complete horror flick noob there elements film i really like though  its really dark film  yeah duh cave  claustrophobia done good effect  i felt queasy watching movie cuz anything else  one scene i felt done well main character falls monsters  pit  completely dark  essentially uses camcorder set eyes  on side note  us ending lousy   completely typical cliched type horror movie ending  the real ending gives film deeper meaning opens possibilities really happened film 
5,i word movie  awesome   movie anything horror movie need  need see movie   star 
2,i thought good job makeup movie script way directed typical movie type  made feel budget 
3,the girls hot   s boring  there couple scary parts mostly s junk nice package  it helps girls hot  cinematography pacing superb   s boring ultimately n t 
3,it s action film horror film  though lots gore  not much story  psychological twists friends begin turn another  totally entertaining  lots fighting ugly cave creatures tons suspense 
4,this movie freaked quite bit  i m bit unsure  yes  s kinda gory  i think dark  clostrophobic nature got  definetly worth least rent 
5,simply spine chilling    after bit drama beginning set relationship friends  movie erupts action thriller biting nails  something i n t done years   this movie otherworldly  may scare would be spelunkers away dark  creepy caves forever  s worth risk love horror  if liked dog soldiers   ll bite   grab popcorn hang creatures stage eyes glued wide open   o k  i viewed bloody scenes fingers first time   i watched twice still jumped things i knew coming  very well written  the cave climbing shots immense fear factor never go top  sure raise blood pressure notches  excellent horror film  i believe director really roll p s  be sure check beautiful mountain scenery chrissy k mcvay  author
4,a bunch women men well  go cave  intended  meet interesting things way  that s said    things  or creatures apparently  short silly review hey  i like movie i certainly enjoyed more the descent   
2,i n t find descent interesting film  it predictable storyline bunch young women go cave  predictably get stuck search another way out once re stuck cave  probably guess happens next  odd creatures  apparently n t see  rely hearing  attack women  different ways  they n t scary people made  just typical looking monsters a big problem i descent picture incredibly dark  majority movie takes place cave  darkness mostly around  except flashlights whatnot  a dark film there couple moments made jump  scene beginning film woman jumped bed walked window  other  movie typical horror bloodfest  it would good idea look elsewhere 
3,how descent different the cave   descent uses female cast  the creatures haunting exactly aliens  the cave  rather evidences results darwin s evolution a year losing husband daughter tragic accident  sarah rejoins friends trip nature adventure  this time  re going caving the problem go cave thought charted  however  soon learn girls decided try uncharted cave  of course  caves  happened go littered blind  screeching bloodthirsty creatures there couple scenes make jump  but  really n t anything special movie   especially ve already seen the cave  neither better 
2,if wasnt suspense sudden frightenly moments movie i would given star 
1,i made hour horrible picture  i kept hoping something would happen  when monster  finally appeared  like watching silly kiddie horror film  i said i ve enough  everyone else watching felt way  this british version  uncut 
3,it starts intriguing thriller  horror movie  ends complete joke  drawn exciting cave expediton monsters living inside finally revealed  turns complete waste time  at least suspense leading dissapointment something n t say atrocious horror films year  pulse  grudge   etc   oh luke warm feel 
3,for patient gore  pretty well grossed would hope the descent  however  gets point  movie drags lags bit getting  i ve seen better i ve surely seen worse  i d give movie  stars gore horribly closed in feelings watching  rest ok ll find interested big bucket popcorn little women discover s kind creatures caves  if small spaces lots gore desire  check movie prepared endure quite bit movie actually gets good 
5,the best horror film years  easy  if way claustraphobic film hard  the cave terrifying  quite acheivement considering modest budget  as women descend deeper cave i felt i watching a stanly kubrick ridly scott film  the buidup real threat fantastic  theaters filled screams movie hits u s next month  i think american studio cut real ending sell unrated  dvd afterwards  they know hit hands  milk s worth  this version must horror fan n t wait year proper us release 
4,really bit sleeper  not press great ride none less  the blu ray visual improvement dvd 
2,i problems film  it seems pretty implausible six potential models would even expedition  even i accept premise  none characters distinguished  i therefore emotional investment  when ultimately get depths cave things become dark confusing  by film i n t know dead dying really n t care this well made film  could great taken cue deliverance  reduced amount characters four gotten well known actress two 
2,hmmmmmm  thoughts mind  gruesome  goulish  bloody  if like  love  it good plot  movie keeps toes  blood gore movie apparent graphic  not suitable children  period 
3,  the descent  latest offering makers  saw  series bent frightening us splattering blood  sickening crunches steadily diminishing body count after shocking opening scene  begins harmlessly enough group women rock jocks going caving unmapped cave supposedly north carolina  though i gave idea elk moose   however  group soon trouble dangers cave   well  inhabitants the movie lives story descends deeper deeper visceral terror  the cinematography  times reminiscent  the blair witch project   frightening heart pounding  way  and s re looking   the descent  delivers  the movie startling gory  lacks believability  makes brutality  if thought  wolf creek    saw ii  n t bloody enough  ll leave  the descent  satisfied 
3,if film scare crap could  little intense  the whole film made uncomfortable claustorphobic sort way  even without creatures menace six ladies adventure  film intense scary  i could see fan gore would give  stars  it type movie   i probably n t even writing review   oh well  i m happy i watched   convinced stay caves  although creatures i think ripoffs short story h p  lovecraft i read last summer  one thing i n t get the ending   what  did n t  was n t  boy i hate that now i think night 
5,this great movie  i n t sure expect i bought  i m glad i took chance  it beautiful scenery  good actors s really quite scary  iv e cave went much farther expected guy n t like confined spaces  this movie captures feel fear involved exploring underground  if i ever go another  i watching freaky creatures live within caves movie  these guys  gals  natually freak  the way look  move  sound great  there plenty suspense alot scary scenes i little  put off  ending  i guess prelude  decent ii   i n t seen yet  over  s worth renting  buying  it s classic  
4,this great movie  however  i commonly say  i fully enjoy movie without watch entirety  the second half movie  i e  monsters really  get little less fully entertaining  that notwithstanding  characters interesting engaging  concept fun adventurish kind way  even better  characters wears arcteryx jacket  far best adventure gear planet  forget northface spyder  overpriced garbage   however  movie great  blu ray transfer  i owned original  sd  version  bought hd i m blu ray junkie  highly disappointed  lots noise video transfer  far much fact movie recently created  i n t advise someone buying replace sd version unless re lost blu ray ocd gods like i 
4,a bunch adventure seeking women decide explore cave part yearly get together  they discover bats stalactites exploration i idea movie i started watching i pleasantly surprised  i familiar actresses definitely gave cramped quarters cave  the movie reminded best zombie movies tension left creatures  the setting plays huge beautiful role  i highly recommend film 
4,i really liked movie  it female cast typical stereotype helpless defenseless  the movie moves fast solid pieces suspense throughout  the ending catches guard  usual ending  good solid acting 
4,although title may say  unedited original cut  not  the movie americanized ending original uk ending  much much much better  do n t fall trick i get crappy american version  go rent dvd instead  make sure select alternate ending ending  this movie would five stars instead four n t american ending 
1,this film utterly horrible  gore shoots creatures women propelled pressure washer  creatures somehow rip several women shreds without teeth coming contact flesh  movements look ridiculous actually moving quickly film rate   monsters  camera far much looking silly rather scary  woman accidentally kills companion heat battle judged  crippled left dead another group  dream gotcha ending  nonexistent plot i fan horror movies  good  it starts compelling story ends slasher flick characters annoying  protagonist included  wait  although lot time money spent special effects  redeeming factor  as obscure military leadership saying goes   you n t polish turd   
1,taking classic james cameron aliens premise  except going underground  really got nowhere  despite great reviews  i got nowhere  i sorry i found nothing new  perhaps  i retard  i felt i robbed time  i found lacked story  story odd  ok   main character dreamed   the journey centre earth much imagination charm rope length

2,okay  let s start good  the atmosphere suitably claustrophobic  the background music fit feel movie  the crawlers well designed   spoiler alert  unfortunately  movie little make empathize  heroine   juno affair sarah s late husband  that bad  but vilified even accidentally killing another girl insanity battle crawlers  leaving girl fell ground  i m sorry  wound  i would expected dead  but  sarah wounds juno leaves behind  i lost interest seeing main character survive  well  since movie n t give us indication escapes caves  well  least part

3,this good book seek taxonomic keys identify insects laboratory  its large size make difficult field  some aspects neglected  e g  physiology evolution  i think lot better books subjects 
2,listening synthesizedst century adaptation great classic could turn classical enthusiast classical hater  after listening anemic attempt capturing power acclaimed musical portrait using synthesized instruments  left wonder recording company n t recorded piece using large orchestra  it begs real thing  at least large orchestra might justification charge  minutes music  i would strongly urge classical music lovers approach caution thinking buying selections classical music series played alexander jero  too bad amazon n t offer money back guarantee opened cds  as sound  enveloping  like surrounded harsh virtual instrumentation 
1,the product give surround sound experience  sounded okay cars audio system  however  version orchestral sound i expecting  rather organ piece  i find rich vibrant 
1,music experience  dimensional soundthis cd shouldnt recordedmy fault bougt cdwas tempted dts recordingi could readed rewiewsthe experience listen saddnes stupidityloke1858

4,i remember kid scared death tv commercials  every time came sister i would freak  i n t seen film years always remembered real twisted thriller  well  s available years later still remains great  creepy thriller  hopkins sooo young already shows tremendous actor  ann margret still true beauty burgess meredith great  eeerie  creepy well acted  this still winner years later  oh  thing  tv commercials  still scary 
4,all i really say movie puppet steals show  it really n t matter weak story puppet s comments made show 
3,i m saddened lackluster movie  could really good edited bit  hopkins n t faulted  performance great  yes  dummy scary disturbing  film unrelentingly grim 
1,oh  god  i remember seeing dummy s ads  that scariest thing movie  i probably   time  i remember watching  the incredible hulk  friday night commercials came  this appeared screen i thought might show  n t  they kept zooming i got scared  from  every time i saw  i would switch channel cover eyes  and years  whenever i ve seen  i ve nearly jumped skin  yeah  fats scary 
4,with recent film successes actor note  likely sir anthony would reminded work modest thriller  he n t worried  though  delivers outstanding performance oft repeated role ventriloquist whose alter ego takes  his jekyl hyde turn corky fats dummy shows  even  actor rise ample support  intended  given ann margret love corky s youth  ed lauter husband  always dependable burgess meredith manager agent finds late star performer really is with ominous yet quiet score jerry goldsmith  film never descends gore common current horror flicks  although best genre  flick still worthwhile viewing experience better average rating reflects   star rating rounded   
4,this anthony hopkins movie seen anthony hopkins fan  he young job acting  ann margret stars movie  i vhs tape happy find amazon dvd i would recommend 
4,i like bluray release anthony hopkins ann margret film  the bluray transfer done nicely extras pretty good could better i really enjoyed dennis alwood interview  fats friends  i wish new interviews anthony hopkins ann margret though  there old  archival anthony hopkins interview leaves much desired  though s better nothing

2,one time favorite movies edited television recorded extended long play  packaged though nothing done  n t buy tape wait dvd version coming soon 
2,  magic  poses question whether ventriloquist corky withers  anthony hopkins  dummy fats two separate entities fats extension corky s twisted psyche  alas  answer telegraphed soon whatever suspense director richard attenborough trying muster drained away  anthony hopkins n t help matters chewing scenery performance s neither terrifying funny  ann margret essentially wasted called upon model tight sweaters  retrospect  entirely bad thing  hight point film burgess meredith hopkins  agent  author william goldman screenwriter adapted book 
3,i admire film sheer terror i experienced watching commerical i young lad  the dummy says  abracadabra i knee  presto chango  hocus pocus put bed  magic fun  we re deadok  may sound like big deal   scary looking dummy dominating tv screen  n t forget  by way  much thanks sister made watch commerical i  years old  my therapist says  everything i suffer fault

3,after reading reviews purchasing  assumption  since close  hours  alotted time would highlight saints miracles throughtout time  if familiar st padre pio word mouth  pictures articles  ll appreciate film  however  advid reader st padre pio  ll probally disappointed well the reason  besides receiving stigmata attacks devil  fails capture incredible abilities  healings  mystic visions  interaction guardian angels  bi location  levititation

2,this  long film  poor performances make longer   lot pay incomplete story line 
1,this book proves mr pinnock  rather dialoguing conservative  evangelical providence theists  extreme libertarian ultra arminian attempting synthesis  amalgamation processism reaction perceived brand hyper calvinism  embrace none authors devastate free willism like millard erickson  this quasi processism plain simple chaff outweighs the wheatmore steak sauce than meat

4,a good introduction plone  but  typographical errors code samples send minor troubleshooting trips  the author covers add ins cause errors try remove   causing troubleshooting  not bad  a little troubleshooting helps learn system 
1,this book maybe six pages useful info  it tells make custom portlet much describes obvious looking plone interface  moreover  i suspect author may know plone zope well save money  the plone books better 
2,if designer wants know customize plone s look beyond changing colors fonts  ll disappointed book  sure  introduction still good  chapter   example   instructs work plone base properties file giving outdated method  well suited upgrades maintenance  i believe stylesheets way go    i m still trying figure  thanks book  the instructions adding slots chapter  impossible follow even vaguely work  yes  text english  descriptions bear little resemblence plone  experience this book  however  give somewhat glossy overview entire application  i would get recent version andy mckay s book  look elsewhere customization help

4,this book great  person bit perception could see going  do n t get wrong  n t  sister got skills  i m talking author   mad props sent camika suspense filled book 
3,this good book  long bit drawn  i believe greg needed get issues mother earlier  usually reality things  i found hard believe sister naive  overall i would read 
5,this exciting book  i finished  days  i cant wait next book 
3,based on the reviews i expected a more scandalous secret  i kept turning pages hoping get good parts  i find funny times  i think s good stories author head  i ll give another try 
4,camika always serious etsu  see actually write book humor almost sent grave  i enjoyed book s good finally see author relax live little  i never thought d author either  all ever made smile play spades  the book i m really glad know i know someone taking bull horns following dream  hey camika  remember water gun fight omegas time kidnapped guy thought line alpha  those days  i m supporter life  oo oop 
1,i shocked i read book  i went purchased i support black authors  when i found sorority sister  i sick stomach  how dare put jarvis christian college  historically black college never attended  you made alma mater look degree received worthless  i successful life jcc alumnus  it black authors protray us positve light degrade us  before writes another book needs get informations researched thoroughly  just case ms spencer reads i reached delta4620  yahoo com
4,for first effort  i found book well detailed creating imagery character development  although shreese s situation reverend adrian s scandal easy predict  ms spencer good job   i felt like i jazz club reading scenes greg s parents  there good research put making jazz life  and felt afro americans insulted stereotyped  lighten   it s fiction  you know  creations imagination  
2,i found story line predictable  i felt author made female characters novel nothing   air heads  she made effort prove woman need complete person  i disappointed sistah feels lowly kind 
2,after reading many  good  reviews book  i decided check library  i think book overrated  there good moments  seemed like book put together night 
5,well bookclub enjoyed every page book new author us got money worth  boy adrian something else knew something n t right like n t bring greg life like  mother real women i m glad sister got head straight  you enjoy book i passed everyone say thing i could n t stop reading 
3,this book okay  i n t explosive good reviews horrible bad reviews  i think writing could use little fine tuning   just thought  look offending people audience  i agree outrages beauticians small town college graduates  hopefully  novel    slow think
3,i read entire book sitting   usual  though book easy read held attention   i n t walk away anything  when i closed cover   like i n t read thing  i suggest checking book library   spending money  one big plus   ending hilarious   though kinda predictable 
3,this book ok  first novel  i felt could came better story line  hopefully second novel better 
5,i dont wrong book  if i could n t put says lot  i read reviews people disappointed  takes work commitment even write paragraph let alone book  camika  n t let comments hinder i ve yet read work  your book flaws s book n t  all i say book grabbed attention i finish matter  that s definition good book  i n t like sappy endings either allowed conclusions  i m sure random house helping everything else  i m forever corner ve done us dream 
5,this book emotional rollercoaster  i bought read  days  by time i finished i breathing hard mad adrian  she knew better  maybe n t  i need sequel 
1,let first say i read reviews work rushed bought  i wish i slowed read pages store  i would left  i found book insulting levels  point i unable finish  all characters simple single minded signs intelligent life anywhere found  i lose words describe bad book  i would recommend  despite read  n t buy  for record  i avid reader enjoys likes toni morrison  alice walker  anne rice  terry mcmillan  valerie wilson wesley  many others  if good  easy read african american life  i would suggest tryin  sleep bed you made  it much better read 
2,it took exactly pages book even begin interesting  ms spencer tendency go spatting seemed opinions  voicing greg  main character  while good  voice smother characters  i thought shreese s character extreme  she seemed like stereotype  it book see true person rather stock character  it slow read pick page   from  i waiting something happen  the climax smooth well written  book closes giving  reader sense closure well  it refreshing since beginning stale  spencer used stereotypes instead modeling characters real people  it almost though book written two different people  this book gone unpublished 
3,the book mixed reviews i gave average rating  i moved book  this author s first book i ll give props  her character development  adrian  could better  what i enjoy author wrote male s persepective  i look forward reading next book 
2,i usually n t give bad reviews i must make exception  i purchased book sometime last year  struggled finish pickin putting couple times after seeing  glorious  reviews i decided give another try finish it  i must say i truly disappointed  i sure ms spencer s next book  bomb  dud me it tooooooooooooo slow  sooooooooooo predictable  i mean i figured book s ending first portion book took ms spencer pages finally get story i m sorry   i expecting lot more based reviews i read  but   i judge  try might like 
2,when all hell breaks loose great disappointment  i thought story building something  i knew ending going bring i got anticlimatic  i n t like synopsis characters  ms spencer n t make really like grow attached characters i could n t less happened  all male female bashing hatred disheartening 
2,after reading reviews book  i thought would pretty good  however  i found predictable  the story line seemed dragging several points book i n t buying the reason adrian s betrayal seemed unrealistic 
3,it okay  it moments  his friends jerks could n t buy clue  his mother reasons leaving family  father understood  somebody clued kids long time ago  their lives may taken different direction  as girlfriend  please  she could n t honest  could honest  it okay book  i think i would like better wiithout couple jerk friends  it made wonder even friends  of course  i n t told anyone had run get  i wished i borrowed rather bought 
4,this wonderful first effort camika spencer  drama  however  perfect word describe  i thought ideas set great stage characters  personalities situations  we able follow main character  greg  throughout difficult stressful times life  i absolutely love interaction greg  friends  family  coworkers  the character development absolutely great  there n t many confused possessed  i quite pleased book  it fairly easy read enough suspense keep looking plot outcome  personally  i pleased able follow greg matured situation  i would much rather find characters changed mature novel  falling scenarios  ms spencer done excellent job premier novel  i look forward work 
3,sometimes bad things happen really good people  such case greg  siter father  greg hopeful adrian  how could compete  you could certainly feel love shared  what shame hurt guy way  why could n t adrian true upfront greg  she entitled live life hurt another process  sherese  sister  hand learned hard lesson life  a  even called god  i glad dad regained love life  i guess sometimes follow dream case mom  heart still 
2,this book poorly written contained information purely insulting  women perms natural small black colleges produce mediocre people  black women uplift people  we get knocked enough already 
3,nice story traveling handyman befriended german speaking nuns  my favorite scene shows sidney poitier teaching nuns spiritual  amen   
2,i think point film faith  everyone likes good miracle movie  right  well  quite  there plenty cringe worthy moments regarding race  mr ashton calling homer boy  telling nuns smith lazy shiftless but still wanted work   weird   i hated scenes shuffling please  and i n t understand mother maria simply could n t say thank you  especially begging everything  out good roles poitier played  give oscar played good field slave told  whatever

4,i really enjoy trigun series  thinking buying soundtrack  i curious though  really tune shows nearly every episode  the calm tune sounds like flute  i n t know title anything  know i talking  could give info  thanks     
1,the user comments technically correct  the film great   original version   deadly china hero   however  clipped version film  last hero china   i highly recommend original film instead  cuts several crucial scenes important subplots  there s reason settle hacked up version 
1,when i first put dvd i noticed cut away opening  movie starts i n t believe eyes quality dvd even lower vcd version  frustrating watch  the subtitle change removed since fixed onto movie  subtitle chinese english use time  quality image subtitle times n t even read  another thing audio  n t switch cantonese mandarin like vcd  yes fixed cantonese  there extra features  might well buy vhs tape  would probably improvement picture quality  it look like tranfer movie overused vhs tape intention sell unsuspecting  customers   read victims  
5,i agree michael van clipped version  deadly china hero  i  last hero china  movie orginal presentation subtitles  this actually  placed order sequences year  fourth  once upon time china  series ouatic iv v came  nonetheless  watch movie  usual  great martial art scenes  i ouatic iv jet li s dvd s available  theth version ouatic  once upon time china america  starring jet li  though mayth jet li wong fei hung  see three previous ouatic s  order important version wong fei hung tales martial artist  real actual chinese hero   get dvd try get  last hero china   in fact  get every jet li movie made  you dissappointed  this replacement bruce lee 
4,this awesome movie remove everything ever knew once upon time china series head  except jet li playing serious wong fei hung  then make movie craziest funniest movies ever stick wong fei hung middle  what enjoyable movie  and much i like  music best part  for know ouatic series  know tsui hark first ones put lyrics movie wong fei hung theme song  well jing wong second  great soundtrack all people trying stick way  please wait fight 
1,deadly china hero poorly edited version original last hero china  i m glad many people like lacks minutes original movie minutes make cohesive movie instead jumble martial arts fights  this taking classic martial arts movie  chopping  releasing different got stop  people deserve chance see original movies 
4,anyone jet li fan indeed appreciate kung fu sequences movie   especially last li makes deadly amalgamation drunken fist shaolin five fist styles   result superb ending fight  the story long irrelevant parts  comprehensible  here s insight   anything yuen woo ping  renowned director martial arts choreographer  touches classic   wu tang master  fist of legend  drunken master   need i say  also  chicken centipede dance ridiculous yet amusing    purchase 
2,i bought film whim  since store i went n t exactly  i wanted  ouatic  fer sure  so i figured i d watch last series since ouatic america huge disappointment  i yet make mind jet li films  and put negative state   the story slow unmoving  characters interesting  fighting sparse  else get kung film   last fight jet chicken suit  jet li in a chicken suit       last straw  i m sorry  fist of legend best  must far worst   i would n t buy dvd your money     
3,this movie needs learn classic movie like enter the dragon missin in action  hong kong movies bad karate  even karate  trust  i m second degree black belt i know m talking 
3,originally titled  the last hero chine   a nice twist wong fei hong storyline  master wong moving martial arts studio  unbeknownst  next brothel  the righteous master n t  turns brothel helps defeat baddies  a ridiculous display jet li fighting chicken outfit quickly made brilliant display drunken boxing  jet li usual charismatic self  yuen woo ping counted deliver every time  
4,it good movie  already last hero china  already movie  movie two different names  i n t know 
2,i love jet li s work  esp  lw   movie terrible  way much wire fu  plot unintelligible seemed like whole film fast forward  the saving grace horrible job translating subtitles  example  character means say  i go bathroom  instead says  i pissing   without would n t funny 
3,though good upon time series  s still pretty good movie  throughs humor mix  ve seen deadly china hero basically last hero china  extra scenes  s something really n t notice n t effect plot movie  they even time favorites gordon lui  s bad guy time though  recommend version dvd two reasons first s jet li  know re getting great fight scenes   even though drunken boxing n t good jackie chan played wong fei hong drunken master   secondly deadly china hero dvd worst dvd collection  s worst anything vhs collection well  so seen upon time china series suggest give chance see jet li play light hearted version made internationaly known
4,this movie deadly chinese hero  changed  if deadly chinese hero  already movie 
4,jet li amazing action filled flick  outstanding fight sequences  along cameo martial arts film legend gordon liu bad guy  some original fights  including must see battle centipede fighters jet  using newly masterd rooster style kung  great action  good story  ofcourse jet li make spectacular mix

3,fong torres talented writer  readers interested rock n  roll history may wish skip book s chapters people like diane keaton  neil diamond  annie leibovitz  tom hanks  eddie murphy     rodney dangerfield   steve martin s worth reading  however   not worry  though  volume contain actual interviews profiles music industry folks like ricky nelson  three dog night  dick clark  you probably see problem book s title cover image  and might understand i got excited i came book s piece iggy pop  unfortunately  two page description appearance iggy tower records drat

4,this warmer good job keeping beverage hot  but mug make difference  all mugs buy raised ring bottom entire bottom touch warming plate  you need look around ceramic mug like ones made hand completely flat bottom  you find line  also bigger mugs n t work well either  i use oz  mug  it s bulb shaped  wide bottom narrows top  i several i bought local craft fairs  it keeps coffee drinkable temp  hours  covering top helps i n t need 
1,very disappointing  barely keeps coffee warm  watts enough  have another brand watts much better  didnt realize much difference  at  cant expect much  not worth much  not worth returning  dont buy like coffee hot 
1,barely applies heat cup  fresh off the stove water luke warm within minutes  very poor  highly disappointing  performance  would never buy another  mr coffee  cup warmer 
2,my coffee cup barely fit plate  i thought i would try different manufacturer mug warmers  i already worked  both products worked  i realize voltage limit  n t keep coffee hot enough unless drink cup coffee minutes  i sip  hours get tired continually zap coffee microwave heat still using coffee warmer can manufacturer s better idea actually works 
5,just i needed since i drink coffee really slow cup warmer keeps coffee warm last drop 
1,i wanted use tea i m away home n t get hot enough  even tepid 
5,sometimes takes forever get coffee  s cold  cold coffee sucks  so i microwave   times morning progressively tastes worse worse  well i tell  s microwave s fault  i finished last sip coffee i poured  hours ago  warm delicious  hours minutes ago  see  i really slow   now i mr coffee warmer i happy  efficient worker  i need get another home  i love  love  love product 
4,i satisfied product  but coffee mugs big properly warmer  i remember use smaller cup order work properly  i warmer i used several years  alas died  it wonderful job  n t remember brand  large enough accommodate larger mugs

2,i bought  give fianc work replace i years  she happy prefers coffee lukewarm  i hand like fresh hot quite displeased since stays lukewarm i ve gone back year old new used  candle warmer   
2,i arrived home today work find mr coffee warmer still heating  i assumed i must forgotten switch though i try careful i turned  should i feel lucky n t start fire  it n t even last year easily rates piece o junk book 
1,this thing waste money thought item would good buy brand since i coffee years old longer anything i  i wrong it n t even keep cup coffee warm even mention hot save money wait around christmas time get dollar stores someplace 
4,this product looks nice easy operate n t keep coffee hot enough  i m people likes coffee scalding hot either  it definitely trick s beef  it might work better closed top mug 
4,this warmer exactly  keep coffee  warm   definitely hot  i guess kept coffee hot would called coffee  heater    it s ok  keeps coffee going luke warm cold 
1,i bought thing  read reviews  i tried everything including using flat bottom cup maximum contact  pre heating cup making sure coffee hot put device  i left warmer  minutes  hot  putting coffee  when  coffee cools off    warmer  gets cooler  it simply run hot enough work  it work put inch pre heated coffee pre heated cup  then keeps semi hot  i took back bb  b 
4,i researched internet read amazon reviews  decided add mr coffee warmer wishlist  my sister bought i ve using less week far  i say i think preforms quite well  i tried putting room temp cold beverage yet  since may strong enough  the less liquid mug  hotter gets stays  the first time i used  melting burning plastic smell  expected never occured  this mug i dissapointed   office  mug works fine  i might suggest using mug top cover since would maintain heat even better  the black color blends desk s quite small eye sore  i d reccommend item  s saving time money since i m dumping cold coffee buying anymore 
3,if looking method reheating cool coffee   this product warm coffee  rather tries keep warm  varying success the coffee warmer keep cup temperature first put  this varies amount cup  with less cup  coffee might actually get warmer  with cup large full cup  might actually cool somewhat the heat output equal watt light bulb 
5,i bought coffee warmers keep coffee warm office  it really job  note cold coffee mug expect device heat  n t purpose  if set warm coffee heater  get go get something printer  get distracted talk people  back desk later coffee still warm  maybe even hot depending hot poured  i love  i bought home  the success coffee warmer dependent coffee mug  i find works best coffee mugs large surface area bottom  i would definitely recommend product  i already  i love 
3,same complaint rest  it could hotter  i think i find flat bottom coffee mug much better 
5,this little warmer works great  it really heat full cup cold coffee  keep hot coffee hot  heat half cup coffee well 
1,this does n t even keep coffee lukewarm    my old that i had for over yrs  was still working  but the plastic was cracked underneath  so it was n t safe to use anymore  i ca n t even find the brand anymore    it was some little known brand  but it sure worked great for    oh well  i just guess i ll have to gulp my coffee and get up off my rear end and heat it in the microwave when it gets lukewarm   ugh   
1,i read several reviews buying kept mind several recommendations  i actually ordered  thinking give stocking stuffer keep  i tried first basically n t work get go  broken i guess   so n t give gift  kept  n t give bad gift   finally got around trying second   put steaming cup hot tea  probably drank half cup pretty quickly second half sat quite i went drink  cold  i hate say i would recommend 
2,i started hot coffee temperature i like keep temperature  still hot enough  mcdonald s coffee n t scare 
5,i use work  turn go get coffee breakroom  best cup coffee already warm 
2,i hoping keep coffee somewhere close hot  my coffee  normal coffee mug  barely warm minutes  yeah  s warmer would without i still go warm fresh coffee i enjoy  my expectations low  i n t even like coffee hot  did not expect thing let  it keeps coffee  seconds worth microwaving 
3,this mug warmer keeps coffee slightly luke warm  i find coffee still enjoyable temperater easy the mug use slightly curved bottom cause less stellar performance  ve looked around mug completely flat bottom hav n t able find  i m sure exists alluded me anyways  keep coffee warm drink able perhaps perform better different mugs  i say product acceptable  i might indepth review actually measuring temp coffee certain amount time passed  i  types coffee mug warmers interesting see results 
2,made china  does n t keep coffee warm enough  if i traditional small coffee mug half full keep pretty hot s   full larger coffee mug coffee gets gets cold leastf degree i like  i m returning looking wattage  watts n t enough

2,the only reason i giving book marginal  stars entertaining bad  the plot contrived  characters sided annoying writing wretched  and   s even funny  i n t even crack grin but probably biggest annoyance book annoying characters  lucy tries desperately assert  independence   s irritating   bad boy sexy mytery cop  the whole mid life crisis thing made mysterious   defiantly sexy   honestly times i stop reading middle chapter walk away raditated   stupidity if read smart  funny airhead  two sexy please check janet evanovich stephanie plum series trust  re wasting time reading title 
2,this book disappointment comparison crusie books  her books first foray contemporary romance  the plot developed interesting matter  and main characters  pretty flat 
5,this first book jennifer crusie read loved  got hold book bad day   i depressed  easy make laugh book  laughed loud   felt good  as crusie favorite romance writer  thank jennifer writing book 
4,it cute story i personally prefer anyone but you story  the character zack story bit rough around edges  although soften lot  i felt character rough  however nice  humorous story  keep reader interested plot 
3,something repetitive little boring conversations first third book  this author s first books n t good later books  i annoyed lucy kept saying n t believe shot danger  even though bullet hit cheek  bomb went car  she went jog beauty parlor stayed home police protection  there humorous lines  i d recommend skipping book unless re die hard crusie fan  it ok  i used  sexual language  mild  number sex scenes   setting  current day u s  copyright   genre  mystery romance 
4,i m recent jennifer crusie fan  working reading  old  books  i love  her writing top  keeps realistic enough believeable  humorous  this earlier books harlequin  temptation  line  see appears harlequin holding back someways   getting rid bradley  n t funny earlier works  it feels like s following rules laid harlequin  however  despite  allows voice  from lucy green hair end  top writing gets better 
3,is book really called  overall  book fast paced fun read  the hero  zach  definitely worth read spoiled book lucy complete ditz  for woman physics teacher lives logic reason  certainly lacked common sense  every time zach called  dummy   i found nodding agreement if n t mind clueless heroine otherwise entertaining story  read book  it day get laughs  but types heroines frustrate  skip book read  manhunting   far superior book crusie wrote early years 
4,i admit bit overwhelmed beginning since jumped characters action  long settle comfortably plot  i adored crusie allows reader certain amount imagination comes lustier moments  the characters wonderful blend humor  intelligence  chemistry  also  plot interesting twists turns  nothing seemed outlandishly implausible 
3,this nearly raunchy others i ve read  notably  welcome temptation  vastly enjoyable  though characters bit unbelievable aspects story seemed stretch  overall plot pretty straightforward  even included enough clues could  times   ahead  characters  plus  dislike main character loves dogs much   
4,this book entertaining funny  i recommend book  it easy reading n t put book 
4,this definitely better reads  it hint mystery  much love making writing   
2,the story line typical crusie formula plot weak felt rushed  characters fall almost immediately without reason tension lacking comparison books

1,as advertised  unit portrayed apc oem replacement cartridge oem apc parts  when unit arrived clearly remanufactured item using batteries  abc   manufactured vietnam   the advertisement presented mention item remanufactured part using non oem parts  this first experience unbeatablesale certainly last 
4,reviews  head wounds  complete trash  richtofen clearly shot right  putting perfectly within range aussies ground   way could brown shot coming behind above furthermore  richtofen gotten nailed fatal head wound would conscious said last word  kaput  aussies approached downed machine he killed single bullet right side entering chest diagonally upward slug exiting left breast  get  brown got  garbage  got short burst skedaddled luck pushed 
3,great video ww1 aircraft flying scens names flyers real  fiction non fiction  john phillp law s brown bit overacted  but great air scenes worth buy 
4,for buff  outstanding flying scenes  even aircraft types wrong  john phillip law good von richtofen  though tall  the baron small  don stroud portrays roy brown sort cowboy  brown officer gentleman  american actors n t play canadians well  if like flying  i highly recommend howard hughes  film hell s angels     as real gets 
2,phoney  lots errors way movie made  bad lip syncing woman singer  played ruthless killers fact stories tell otherwise  one part shows bullet shot top head flying  yet see head bandaged wraped around side head wound top 
3,what shame  life death combat gasoline powered kites  heroic personalities nostalgia dramatic time rendered uninteresting wooden performances mediocre costuming  see the blue max instead  its german pilots inaccurately kitted uhlan uniforms least story compelling acting better  and usula andress hard watch either  someday maybe hbo right  until  s pretty much two movies  dawn patrol   
2,quite aside historical gaffes  many well documented others   s really lousy movie characters clumsy  everyone nasty everyone else  bad attitudes pass drama  i thought worst movie subject time  recently seen newer  the red baron   while movie much nicer airplanes  long list historical absurdities  i think wins  race fairy tale but top  dialogue silly editing chopped n t even follow storyline so  von richthofen brown nd worst movie subject  still awful 
1,to perfectly fair  nova s documentary disputes claim made keri bailey  kilby  review regarding death manfred richtoven  bailey cites undenialble proof  nova s documentary shows another side story claiming raf flier roy brown could shot  red baron   it includes autopsy reports photos neither showed described head wound cited bailey s claim this review made author blood scotland  m e  grant 
1,this movie good  it seemed like low budget maderd world tv production  the planes hoaky wrong type time periods portrayed story  the story red baron incorrect well  ending totally wrong  for movie history way base 
3,the complete collection wonderful photographer s work available  book unfortunately printed poorly qualities photographs lost  the photos look muddy suffer low contrast  the essay  however  excellent  worth reading introduction bravo s life work  the aperture books bravo s work  offering far fewer photographs  much better reproduction 
3,bracelet nice described  clasp hard work stones little purple color  however  i think fair value 
1,this made ok  the stones washed  color  purchased gifts give embarrass  i would returned i traveling missed deadline 
3,ok  i ve read reviews i agree  this movie simply beautiful  i pre ordered gem day announced  but  imagine surprise came standard version  even amazon com advertises widescreen disc several places  gaah  so disc loses two stars  one false advertising  yep  even image preview said widescreen    stupid decision first place  they already re mastered letter boxed laser disc  could n t   especially since company released incredible widescreen enhanced fiddler roof same day  anyway  i ve said piece  if never plan buyx tv dislike black bars  found letter boxed editions  buy disc  otherwise  n t support nonsense  wait criterion  well should  
5,the film nice flow plot  the music great  it geared toward italian familia  i love cher  nicholas cage  olivia dukacas  they gave great performances  i already loved la boheme prior seeing movie bought cd movie soundtrack  anyone wanting see enjoyable movie listen great music put high list  it entertaining holds interest  unlike lot movies  it used  star movie rated  star movie  high  star  it classic viewed  the music puccini live forever  once see movie  music flows scene scene mind a must buy cd 
1,i complete agreement viewer mn unfortunate full screen format dvd version produced  what blunder  what loss visual information important script  i make vhs recording tcm they presented movie  letterbox format  i hope someone smartens up rereleases moonstruck dvd delivers great cinematography 
4,wonderful movie  stand chopped format  get  if letterbox  tape  december  tcm  or look rumored widescreen dvd version   why ever made chopped version dvd  i ll never understand   
1,like reviewers  i m baffled letterbox  i live without super duper extras  i reason upgrade vhs widescreen version published  the rating reflective dislike fullscreen formatting  the movie great romantic comedies a love letter love  nyc 
2,this fantastic movie   i would buy second   features commentary sound wonderful i wont buy dvd comes widescreen 
2,i toshiba blu ray player s year old blu ray dvd would play player s new apparently year old blu ray player needs upgrade costs   so i m reluctant buy blu rays  i regret getting blu ray player  i gave dvd friend i m sure s fine  n t get unless new blu ray player

5,yes dear viewer  moonstruck provides sophisticated elements good movie could offer  a great story  excellent performers fabulous music puccini  end
5,a full cycle emotions watching real artists deliver craft  cher beautiful  humorous devilish themen life complicate compliment 
3,got christmas gift somebody loves movie  let s hope dvd version edited  we watched film night couple scenes deleted probably  time  constraints  so  let s hope percent okay 
1,the first disc defective  returned replacement  the replacement slightly sync video audio movie  shows poor quality control 
4,i dont care what people say about cher  but i enjoy this movie so much i got it in vhs and now on dvd even though its a bit crazy  it has a clitch to it  learning that her boyfriend has to go to palermo for his mother bed dying side and in the mean time learning that he has a brother no one ever talks about nicolas cage could have made a better preformance but he is good in the mean time she learns her father is having an affair with a lady that only wants his money and his attention in the mean time learn the meaning to life and choosing to live instead of living life with out no meaning 
3,the bottom line  moonstruck never feels authentic  e g  scenes old italian looking moon saying  o bella luna    feel weird quirky enough set apart romantic comedies  may mean s good film  i certainly n t think   re sick usual tripe instead watch unusual tripe 
2,all stupid jerks screw lives lives around  fortunately safety new york city  women wise  patient nurturing  manage get bozos back track  no wonder wife thinks best movie time 
2,this review movie general  there enough already  however dvd dissapointing  purportedly sound upgraded dolby  surround  the sound instead washed volume difficult maintain level  often volume needs increased hear actors reduced background music swells  almost bad video  it s produced dvd old  beat print  small flashes white black spots continually appear throughout movie i bought dvd reputable retailer  plays like bootleg 
3,i almost returned dvd unopened n t letterbox format  moonstruck time favorite great movie deserving letterbox format release  i subtract  stars 
3,the movie favorites however damaged minutes  i repeatedly cleaned i see defect disk continues problem  what suggest i  i satisfied video
1,i bought widescreen edition feel totally ripped    i standard format edition  i love movie much  worth buying widescreen format  this  widescreen  edition nothing standard format edition top bottom chopped  this time actually better standard format edition  i watched editions side side  widescreen edition much wider  missing top bottom picture  there actually see standard format edition 
4,this time took bit longer  but i guess n t fault  russian post blame  thanks anyway 
1,fake italian accent ruined everything  they gotten real talented italian actress movie instead 
2,an italian guy itchy scalp waits dessert ask italian woman marry  meanwhile brother wooden hand pizza shop mother try stop wedding  there s lot strange cultural dialogue customs movie i understand  if n t enjoy listening lot conversation kitchens bedrooms i would avoid 
1,i think wise review cd seperately  far removed movie featured it this said  let s look merits cd  first  featured classical music  the classical music used regular run mill hits cherish  italian classics  this could good could bad  depends taste c music  in case music never struck postitive nerve  i guess taste classical music love big hits masters  you know million seller tunes i really felt like music waste  far individual needs concerned  the song i really got kind charge non classical piece  moonglow   it really stole show opinion  in fairness  i ask anyone buy cd 
3,i love movie  the thing extremely disappointing backround loud i hear dialog 
5,i cher fan  always always  that said  i n t always fan movies  but regardless weather cher true classic every way possible  i must seen movie times last years still never tire  i use many catch fraise often movie become part everyday language  this story reminds childhood i came typical italian family acted much way lived jersey side ny  story house view hudson  this movie dead character  vibe humor  if n t seen moonstruck  n t know re missing  i might add  nick cages finest performances  rich
1,when dvd released  somebody struck idea dvd concept  the commentary s helpful informative  but help understand academy award winning movie shown widescreen  or input nicholas cage viewpoint making film  did i mention widescreen  this film must adamantly rereleased special addition widescreen full attention detail deserve five stars  until stick video save money 
5,this movie funny well written  if like laugh love love story buy movie 
5,  when love em drive crazy know  many truthful  poignant  memorable lines intelligent  warm  grown up story  this n t movie  s tradition story telling s finest  the music  settings  characters tell fine  truthful  i swear i smell food kitchen  dining room  restaurant  ll see i mean see movie 
1,totally unacceptable  i would buy movie version original aspect ratio 
1,i absolutely agree previous reviews  great movie  widescreen version dvd  otherwise i watch tv  i hope someday i ll able buy widescreen version 
1,i n t believe great film has giventhe widescreen treatment   deserve some extraswould nice 
4,this movie great  nick cage younger cher   well   anyhow   look great story clever well built grounds la boheme  lover s classic opera  cameos lot great actors time  the roots catholic italians new york intriging   whole issue age s timelessness   definitely collection 
5,i never grow tired seeing movie  i sureif i italian relate many scenes actions  excellent acting cher  nicolas cage others put forth roles a love story grabs attention first act holds glued seat throughout movie tender  sweet loving  yet tinted true life raw emotions  outstanding this movie miss seeing  excellent 
4,moonstruck movie easily deserves five stars  however  dvd edition moonstruck edited full screen format original widescreen  as far i m concerned  publishers edit film manner  effect butchering film makers  original vision  one grossly butchered scene involves cher aielo  sp   together front seat car  viewer allowed see actor time  full screen format fit actor onscreen  this causes audience miss exactly one half actor s wonderful performance  what shame to knowledge widescreen version outstanding movie available dvd  that s bad 
3,i bought wife  mother s day  replace videotape version widescreen  theater layout  it course great moonstruck dvd  letterbox format  sound seems mixed little low  i m tempted say sound may touch less clear videotape version  so  crank volume tv  n t big deal  next time turn tv  blam  it s blaring 
2,a cute  romantic comedy  great scenes manhattan brooklyn  very good character development  cher nicolas cage work well together  olympia dukakis great job emotionally deep  morally strong mother sense humour  great music  though  mix dynamic  sound stays mainly center channel  muddy  making dialogue difficult follow times  the video pan scan  ruins book 
2,it s interesting movie since i involved large  close knit italian family several years  many parallels real life based experience   bad thing  very enjoyable on rental  in addition restart movie  times  supposed amazon s hd version movie poor quality looked like old vhr quality disappointing watch blurry picture  i register complaint though i doubt change particular offering based response i received this first last movie rental amazon 
5,i romantic heart  love good love story  been cher fan since day tv 
1,why earth released pan scan  i ve watched vhs copy countless times looking forward replacing nice widescreen dvd  but  fuggitaboudit 
5,i recently took bus load seniors bus trip  the trip  hours long  we usually movie show time goes faster  i picked moonstruck  it funny light hearted  it quite hit  the seniors mostly italian really enjoyed movie  some missed came quite years ago  it s first time showed appreciation movie clapping  i pleased 
2,serves right checking viewer reviews first  i absolutely love movie gave away vhs version i ordered dvd  so  i still   screen format  widescreen format i looking forward  focussing  content  would misleading dvd buyers  amazon  i m tempted return  subtract three stars really irritating studio decision 
2,note norman jewison  re release wonderful movie letterbox format  intended shown  tcm shows widescreen  n t public 
2,this best movies time  the reason i dont movie dvd available full screen  the movie  star movie dvd receives  stars lack options widescreen viewing  i waiting patiently change widescreen unfortunately i suggest  you miss much including director s vision watch full screen worth see fabulous movie way originally made 
2,the sound quality bad dvd i returning  i surprised mgm would release dvd poor sound  it totally ruins movie n t easily hear actors saying  also  music important part movie totally destoyed lousy sound i would describe tinny  equalized towards upper frequencies   i  movie old large laserdisk  sound fantastic media 
1,i rated  dvd  lowest possible rating  although i would give movie highest rating  who makes decisions regarding full screen versus letterbox  with advent dvd s  excuse us miss incredible cinematography s new york glory  i absolutely refuse buy copy movie reissued  remastered includes serious extras  this greatest romantic comedies time 
3,good emotional  not much romantic comedy expected  plus i nicolas cage fan  would rent buy 
3,moonstruck huge hit released  much earnt cher oscar performance  i enjoyed film back  rewatching last week  i think great  very over rated today s standards cher portrays italian woman  crossroads life  in fact characters crossroad  the film explores risks people  hope living happy life  just cher becomes engaged boyfriend  meets real soulmate people interested buying dvd perhaps look overseas  the australian release glorious anamorphic widwidescreen version  whereas usa version pan scan full frame  urgh   
5,this perhaps romantic movie i ever seen  but n t let word romantic turn away this movie hilarious  there something movie everyone  cher olympia great deserved oscar  it s full fluff trash it s perfect date movie also reccomended  moulin rouge  my big fat greek wedding  about boy  
5,  moonstruck  time favorite films  frothy  romantic  poignant  film watch  all characters loveable endearing  i feel like i part castarini family every time i watch  the script absolutely perfect  every line quotable  one favorites rita s wry   cosmo n t own moon   puccini s gorgeous melodies  la boheme  make perfect musical backdrop contemporary masterpiece  a gem 
4,this collection is worth the price the only collection available  until one of her old labels in the us decide to get together and release a more comprehensive collection this is the one  there are no songs from her days with warner brothers or columbia  but definitely worth the price of admission 
2,iv e heard mauro piccoto s good stuff i though would like  s way hard liking  though like hard techno  go  warned  certainly n t trance  exception  back to cali    
2,my loves appearance shoe  item description misleading product features listed description  leather soft  calfskin leather upper a youth shoe employs powerpulse technology optimal kicking power eva insole comfort split outsole optimal weight flexibilitythe tag shoe actually lists synthetic upper  i would recommend seller based deceptive advertising 
2,got pair daughter  however  tried  hard time fitting quite tight  though fits  comfortable  ended wearing 
1,bad  not a good bad  just plain bad people run backwards and weapons float in the air there is no thinking to do on a mission as long as you know how to pull a trigger missions are too short  a lot of effort probably went into the game but it s still just plain and ugly bad 
2,this book alright  it n t exactly i expected  the story seemed little kindergarteners  they n t quite understand  it would probably great first second grades

4,pampers swaddlers equally good  swaddlers comes additional box packing  waste environment  i like better comes without additional box packing
3,somehow hold less size pampers cruisers   good product 
3,these diapers ok  comparing swaddlers  ok  the fit great baby gets red spots thighs  stretchy bands  and forget hour protection night cause   hours leaked  i like thin compared brands  i would recomend swaddlers 
5,i mother  ranging ages i always used pampers  best  i tried none compare baby dry  i n t problem leaking  n t tear easily  nice sent  affordable  what else could ask 
2,it s okay i n t use pampers dry max  compare dry max  dry diaper n t absorb much makes diaper heavy  so need change diapers frequently using dry diapers  my  month old daughter first diaper rash starts using dry diapers  previously used dry max   so i n t buy dry diapers anymore 
5,i really like diapers  i fewer leaks pampers swaddlers  i like contoured fit huggies pure natural  i loved super absorbency  they hold lot  my baby heavy wetter  almost never leak  even though stretchy  i find fit fine compared huggies  price difference absorbency  i would choose 
5,thanks amazon i longer run store get diapers show doorstep  and savings great 
4,pampers always favorite diapers frankly get  baby dry  tailored pampers gel  my baby n t break  baby dry  like tailored ones  the thing i n t like n t hold enough wetness night  but baby pees gallon  i guess ll   
5,i tried huggies  pampers loves  far pampers far best  price cents diaper great deal  i priced around didnt find better deal size  very happy
3,i bought diapers low price  they okay  comparable luvs  i expecting better absorbancy since  pampers   i n t get  if child close going size  i d say order size  they fit fine either way  gives absorbancy avoid leaks  i m satisfied becuase price  n t first choice diapers 
5,just noticed i could buy open box pampers cheaper  arrived outside opened  cares dont keep box  pampers closed original package 
3,personally  found luvs functional  blow outs  keeps butt dry  softness significantly cheaper price  this product worked well  much value luvs pack 
1,left baby diaper rash  days use  i n t suspect diapers first couple weeks later i went finish using package rash appeared  i ll never use pampers 
5,while i prefer cruisers s really big deal baby dry work well re cute 
2,i m pampers fan  from swaddlers cruisers baby dry  but daughter moved size   pamper leaks night  she soaking mess morning  and soaking particles diaper  the diaper literally falls apart  i bought case s almost finished thankfully  back cruisers go 
3,i really wanted like diapers  they soft really nice vibrant colors  nice change since i use huggies usually  i love slight baby powder smell  it seems people either love hate  i find baby dry diapers run small  my baby small side  even lbs  yet baby dry  fit perfectly  way could work lbs  my couple leaks diapers always top n t fit snuggly around waist like huggies extra elastic around waist band  i betting diapers would well baby girls chunkier babies  although might need order size larger  get good fit around waist baby i return tried true huggies spite nice smell  faded pastel colors soft diaper  whatever works though  
4,i used pampers swaddlers baby first born loved    it s silly  since s outgrown swaddlers i ve started buying less expensive diapers  i ve missed powdery clean smell pampers room  i figured would lot better huggies price  i excited find good deal pampers  turns re fine  softer huggies  get wet feel like full gel  kinda weird  i n t think worth paying get  i n t problems  oh  baby around pounds  i done pack  i think i ll move size   he s months  little chubby   diapers getting little small around waist  plus  sleeps long time  challenges capacity 
5,it n t leak  stay dry long time   thinner layer provides flexibility daughter s movement  strongly recommend 
2,we started swaddlers  moved baby dry size   at size   switched huggies  no pampers diapers elastic back waist  asks poo explosion back  we several  i finally realized friend s diapers elastic back n t problem  she generic store brand even  i never put pamper kid i n t clothes stained 
1,my  months old ve using pampers swaddlers pretty much since birth  we bought baby dry size two s horror show ever since  diapers hardly day since n t clean explosive diaper  my breast fed s solid food diaper labeled  baby dry  should done trick instead un absorbant thus leaky  even diaper n t shot poo baby s backside playing i place changing table  sure  creating mess  my husband wants throw diapers  i give away almost seems cruel give someone 
5,we  month old b g twins  i love diapers  they thin  yet protect well  we n t diaper rash yet hopefully stay way  but i rinse almost every time poop  we tried huggies n t hold  bulky many leaks  so go 
5,i find pampers work better longer leaner babies  toddlers chunky babies  less leakage  huggies work better chunky babies 
2,i typically use pampers swaddlers thought would good cheaper alternative  these diapers tended give gel balls worst wetness indicator  although swaddlers expensive re definitely worth money 
3,i love pamper s swaddlers  i ve tried huggies pampers brands  swaddlers favorite  that said  baby dry diapers terrible  if need quality diaper  shell extra dough swaddlers

5,it fast delivery  days free shipping without tax it s cheap everywhere 
2,i m little peeved i using pampers nany dry  years  unannounced company makes pampers baby dry diapers made major design change pampers baby dry diapers  seem like huggies   much elastic  narrower straps much less absorbent material  it s hard make thru night without diaper change 
3,it took nearly three weeks fianlly ship  i canceled  i n t realize showed many weight period left 
1,i pampers lover  anymore  i used pampers diaper three years first second  but  looks like company makes thin diaper recently  as another mom says   diaper gets full  burst absorbant material goes everywhere   i absolutely agree  therefore  i cancelled subscription changed another brand 
3,they n t   ve best diaper ve tried far  closer   others ve tried include kirkland huggies  i ve told size child little average height weight  may case diapers

2,pampers baby dry huge misnomer   terrible urine intake  if baby sleeps tummy night   you will wake up with a wet baby and wet sheets everything  use pampers swaddlers   least size  largest size swaddlers make reason  you thank later  baby dry  wet baby    
5,no leaks  blow outs   i love s easy tell wet  brands thick s kinda hard tell 
1,i m new mom first i introduced pampers swaddlers hospital   nice fit  wetness indicator stripe  leaks  good absorption  well i ordered case babydry mistake thinking  i wrong  the baby dry fitting  poorly constructed diapers n t even need wetness indicator ll see around baby s sheets    you always make sure fasten high tight ll leak  also baby runny stools good luck  sometimes ll catch times n t  i n t like plastic bag feel  maybe s  rating stays star

5,love diapers   my  month old daughter leaking diapers found    no wet sheets morning    and  ca n t beat diapers bucks    love amazonmom   
5,we think great diapers  virtually never blowout what learned weight recommendation box generally ignored  the size  packaging says  lbs  our baby started wearing around lbs it s really simple  when diaper gets full  s room   thus blowout with first child  using size weight recommendations   blowouts ruined clothing regular occurance  with second child  ignoring size weight recommendations   blowouts rarity 
4,i pleased amazon mom especially buying diapers  the pampers economy pack gives plenty diapers last next delivery  i love price 
4,great money  especially sign subscribe save amazon mom discounts  i like many brands tried 
3,i thought swaddlers little disappointed  but worked fine  i think use cloth cost effected better environment  my babe small fit cloth diapers use disposables  so i happy start using cloth gaining weight  but whatever diaper choose best mom dad baby  keep good work love lots

4,as mom   i lots experience diapers  i tried go  cheap  route early  quickly discovered actually save money use cheap diapers  basically  changing often likely experience i like call  blow outs   even compared brands  pampers performs every time  they abosorb saving money washing long run  i really love pampers introduced baby dry less expensive good cruisers extensive experience 
5,i lovemonth baby using bit started using pamper crusiers tad bit expensive exact thing  great hold alot  pampers are better than huggies i tried them and had a horrible expiernce  my baby wouldnt have them on even on min when she would be leaking  these diapers last her great all through the night real full   but no leaking  i highly reccomend them
1,this worst diaper i used different brand pampers  just quantity n t mean good quality  i ready yet  i giving pampers cruiser try i make final decision move another brand diapers  i hoping still continue business  since i using brand  years children 
2,when baby sleeps hours  diaper wet  it leaked times  also  subscribe save amazon  price almost doubled within past  months  i got box less  april   i check somewhere else better deals 
2,pampers good quality  pretty good protection blowouts  etc  but two complaints  first  s mesh inside sticks baby s bottom pretty consistently  worse  us   dry  part chemicals diaper  caused baby develop red  rashy skin quickly  we ve since read common issue pampers  especially  dry max   overall  i would recommend friend  huggies others worked far better us 
2,props   the diaper actually good job dry out cons   it thin hold watery poop it wetness indicator definitely good choice new parents  i probably buy baby older  months s cheaper others 
4,i love pampers diapers  i using swaddlers switched baby dry lower price  i would say pretty comparable  i like design swaddlers better  baby dry blue quite soft like swaddlers pay little less i think ll happy baby dry 
2,my daughter using pampers diapers since born  we tried huggies size   felt cheap thin  oh leaked everytime  so went back pampers cruisers  she size  i wondering baby dry cheaper  i decided try box  baby dry n t s diaper job  she wet car seat  chair many times already baby dry diapers  we decided go back cruisers  they best daughter  pampers overnight night time use best well  ofcourse occasional leaks  minimum  sometimes leaks happen  minimum okay 
2,these diapers feel wet touch  i thought crazy morning i went change feeding burp clothe i laid  blowout feeding work clothes wont get messed  wet  i thought leaked i looked pjs wet spots near openings  i diaper essences split different spots  i n t buying

2,i used days  bought big box put craigslist baby dry lovers  recommend usethem  every time change layers clothing diaper  bad laundry budget 
5,i bought pampers i heard best  however rethinking due poop explosions daughter
1,i purchased these  days ago and had free   day shipping  and have still not received the product  we have two babies at home that are both in diapers so i was hoping this would be convenient and i purchased these because we do n t live close to a city so i was trying to save us a trip   what a mistake     very disatisfied with amazon  
4,i used buy pampers   cruisers  time  but reading reviews  i decided give  baby dry  try   i m forever fan pampers  need go brands    baby dry  proven economical  with diapers package  last lot longer  cruisers  without compromise quality  price wise s cheaper  thisnd order nothing goes wrong  i m gon continue ordering  however seem soft  cruisers   s keeping dry i n t consider critical factor  my baby happy  diaper rash stays dry  what could asked  mother mo daughter
4,good diapers  high price  would use store brand instead  small babies n t pee much  save money buy cheaper diapers 
2,by time i wanted size  diapers baby  pampers swaddlers available i buy reading reviews  the problem n t wet indicator baby dry n t absorb runny poop tends go right back side diaper onto outfit usually whatever whoever lying on it s worth money saved  i buy swaddlers  hope helps someone wondering buy swaddlers baby dry  definitely go swaddlers   this almost existing reviews 
1,i useally buying dipers amazon com  however  dipers box looks like old  also  i see brown spots surface  i really return  i already opened used  check diper time

2,my review comments apply amazon s shipping rather product  i recently subscribed amazon mom rudely surprised see regular two day shipments started taking almost days arrive   i wish amazon would let us know advance would stopping two day free shipping came prime membership  enroll amazon mom  very disappointing indeed 
3,these diapers soft feel comfortable hand  but n t secure well  they tend slide create big mess active baby  huggies opposite  little stiff secure better  so weigh two  personally  i feel scent little much babies 
4,these work great daughter although seem run little small grows sizes quick  leak proof sleeps night 
5,these diapers great absorbency i change diaper middle night  sleeps hours  leaks diaper rashes 
4,these diapers good  i would given  stars tabs easily breaks

2,great  she wanted every  seconds headache  i trying brand different method 
5,baby stays dry happy time use pampers especially count real value
2,pampers cruisers better pampers diapers  i would recommend particular type  leak  still better  
3,i using pampers cruisers dry max long time comparisons  i wanted give baby dry try since s still pampers  cheaper  baby dry dry max  softer  after several weeks use  realized pay get  the baby dry hold much  would wake wet leakage many times  poop would leak  since i ordered  boxes trying save money use diaper day change frequently  we purchased cruisers dry max use night  if little wets lot night  diaper  my months right 
5,i mom  kidsth way  we used pampers years  we trust best know experience s worth money  they gentle skin leak proof  do n t waste time trying diapers i tried nothing compares pampers quality

2,after getting box diapers  defected   amazon s great customer service replaced box luvs  the diapers tend sag leak  i really recommend mom i know i would n t purchase 
1,the price great twin grandsons  after month babies developed severe rash baby dry diapers  other mom s said thing  now switched huggies 
1,these pampers leaked  five times makes changing much harder i recomend product anyone 
4,as new mom  i ve tried couple different brands   pampers winner  for specific  s great cost  wetness indicator   something live without  ones  help quite bit  but n t complain change diaper like  times day  cost comes big player purchasing items 
4,pampers baby dry luvs two go to brands active little guy  for newborn thru   pampers definitely favorites  but hit size three  ve gone numerous times   and thing say sure like better huggies    we get batch pampers  months ago elastic tabs would sometimes break apart  pampers credit gave us refund well half off coupons could use local tarzjay  probably random bad batch something  probs others in  really comes cost   and compare pampers vs luvs  luvs ends cents cheaper diaper  given way dems republicans ruining economy  every cent makes difference  hence reason i m giving luvs  star pampers  star rating  excellent luvs little cheaper 
3,diapers would fine babies daughter allergic reaction cheaper diapers   i thought i getting great deal n t work ended gifting  she fine cruisers huggies though  just fyi 
2,as another reviewer mentioned  pampers changed design  we hate new design  amazon old design stock  there s unfortunately difference box product labeling  i suppose get open chance 
2,diapers basicly size problem n t get something comapable size   i ordered size  longer fit things huge constantly leak hope pampers sees goes back old sizing pampers best leaks etc stupid  combo insane   
2,i two main complaints  these absorbant pampers swaddlers  since s diaper  s pretty much main task  i n t experience liquid leakage  solids problematic  any detailed description probably prevent review published     these diapers wetness indicator lines found swaddlers  i n t realize lines useful i subscribed  used get target  anyway  two reasons sufficient cancel subscription two shipments this review means related amazon s subscription shipping service  i think amazon fantastic job  all shipments arrived stated arrival dates problems 
3,i ordered daughter came home daycare wearing pampers diaper  i loved  unfortunaltey  diaper came home  these plastic worth money  with exception cute prints  exactly like luvs  lot expensive  i like luvs  thats i wanted paid  also  diaper i loved much actually pampers cruiser  which i ordering next time around  like swaddlers   soft  cloth like 
2,its expected  i really did nt like pampers baby dry i using pampers swaddlers dry max since baby born  i problem  it really soft feels good  but comparatively pampers baby dry good  it looks like plastic by seeing price ust got fooled so beware purchasing product 
4,i found baby dry diapers hold well night  they soft pampers cruiers  work great  i found amazon best price around   shipped right

3,i read anything i ancient egypt factual data historical novels  i hard time getting particular novel  it bit slow moving got better progressed 
1,this author knew little ancient egypt  s people s history  n t bother learn a wast time 
2,i wish broken sections like copy i borrowed library  it s kind overwhelming way printed without breaks 
2,i know classic  popular book  walt whitman amazing  seemed like rambling random thoughts  i m sure lines really speak  i could n t finish  maybe s intellectual 
2,at least available kindle  edition  it seems final edition  course great  i intended get based product description posted  also  foreward afterward mentioned description missing  i n t expect moon low price  i expect get i pay 
2,i bought book based buyer s reviews  i disappointed  this book filled much violence little mystery content 
2,literature book pictured amazon website  old version took forever get 
1,i bought returned  there must someone right voice reading skills bring us whitman s words rhythms  ms gibson s soprano sing song n t make 
1,whitman glorified  whitman s descriptions nature inspired style exudes passion subject  yet  self absorption overshadows talent  whitman s poem   song myself  takes significant portion book  leaves grass  here  whitman keeps points reserve  spends sections  celebrating   he feels   great panacea  he suckles mercy fills subject matter  influences technique structure well  his intriguing mind leads reader along  disappointment found another laborious passage expounding god status call ascend level distorted thinking  whitman s momentary descriptive nuggets lost narcissism 
3,several reviewers state whitman  real american   fair enough  but  bravado self love  defended sort humility someone projecting romantic reading onto person self proclaimed imperialist  he hardly someone wanted everyone find truth  of course  today s post  america  imperialist certainly makes whitman seem like contemporary american 
2,the bold faced comments laura ross frustrating  who cares thinks  it would much appropriate easier read without  the thoughts sensitive original  seems lick gemick not happy book 
2,i recently got kindle  i started looking books put  walt whitman s  leaves grass  old favorite  i looked kindle editions  there matches search  though actual book poems  my complaints offering start absence table contents  whitman n t title poems original edition  though subsequent editions  table contents could show first line poem  beyond lack toc  edition identified  publisher   makes difficult  though impossible  associate rating specific offering 
5,i needed copy  leaves grass  includes prose preface  the formatting kindle book perfect  i know i could read computer free websites  i wanted version kindle  this kindle edition disappoint  i gladly paid   portable  option  i prefer reading kindle computer screen 
5,this good app works well system problems app far 
5,love   love  i trying find book  i guess electronic copy works better since i forever kindle 
5,this thick soft backed  pocket  book pages  it could called the complete whitman  it contains hundreds poems i senior citizen read whitman years enjoying much  his descriptionsth century s people  places  inventions eye openers  he actually feminist concept  abolitionist  he truly believed equality democracy  he nature lover wanted protect environment of course  parts i could quibble  would foolish  whitman ahead time 
2,walt whitman s literary reputation hyped  gay  critics  i suspect   i m totally hostile free verse  fact  i like t s  eliot  famous proponent genre  whitman wrote ramblingly  seemingly devoid poetic coherence reader s creative imagination left unstirred  i agree robert frost  truly great american poet  writing poetry without classic  conventional rules like playing tennis  net 
4,i like push read  i enjoy grade associated  be place put different time place  project writing mind simpler time 
1,i compared many editions edition completely wrong  structure poems messed up it s pity considering whitman s poetry people simon brown even able print edition manages respect something simple spacing lines poems here example simon brown edition  exactly printed  as i ponder d silence  returning upon poems  considering  lingering long  a phantom arouse distrustful aspect  terrible beauty  age  powerit painfully obvious  i seen editions i consulted  as i ponder d silence  returning upon poems  considering  lingering long  a phantom arose distrustful aspect  terrible beauty  age  power  the whole book edited way  makes unreadable
4,a nice book read relax reflect life  i enjoy poems awhile go book 
2,in full bloom late sixties  i find much whitman s writing far less rhapsodic even elegiac i remember told  hot air  
1,i n t exposed whitman education i gave try  i ploddingly tediously read introduction first pages book i threw down i failed i sorry  certainly i philistine deserves excoriated community loves work  here s attempt make peace  if re wondering whitman s  leaves grass  good place start enjoyment poetry  go ahead give whirl  you get used penny 
3,i hate literary types venerate books authors like virgin mary see problems inherent  this book really boring  yes  amazing style poetry revolutionized literature  s still boring  his poems  like song myself drag like pages rumbling sorts thoughts  events  seemingly haphazardly chunked together without real logical thread  drags  drags  i dare anyone read book cover cover 
1,this edition does not contain table contents  makes impossible navigate totally useless overall save dollar look elsewhere 
3,keep freebies coming  amazon  turn walt whitman expert  never cared i younger  now i golden years  i love reading  better late never 
3,while i love whitman s  leaves grass   i would n t quite consider reproduction  original  edition  the editor highlighted certain passages green  added commentary exercises poem  i suspect lots folks n t mind  for s cause enough return book i pre ordered item i intent finding edition preface  without new person s additions classic work  i much would like read work whitman presented  without interjections editor new person whose voice interruption this editor presents work means writers find inspiration work  attempts guide least aid reader project  for someone like  writing  reading  intensely personal  prefers work directly text  without intervention  right book 
1,a co worker gave book  he fan i  whitman grew  next several months  i learned appreciate work however  i left book toilet disturbed relative snooped taking dump  discovering secrets co worker i together  i regret ever read silly book planning burning 
1,it frustrating kindle accommodate  it fun read awkward line breaks 
1,while i adore first edition leaves grass  book advertised  i definitely encourage buy another edition  i returned note  hopefully amazon change description soon 
4,so far i across typos edition  the typesetting ideal  the introduction fine  line breaks placed somewhat arbitrarily text poem  necessary play font size and or words line get satisfactory formatting  it shame engraving whitman included first edition book reproduced  other  good original edition book small price
3,note  review whitman s work  always worthy five stars  instead evaluation particular kindle edition leaves grass this great value  s perfect  it includes bearable representation text  table contents hard navigate  s tough get kindle s cursor even line links  default text size lines poems n t wrap well  however  cents  i real complaints kindle book  especially supplement since i already real text version paper 
2,it difficult find specific events dvd  partly main menu organized olympics day  day    partly events simply n t  kim yu na  instance  screen seconds  so n t look world record setting performances  figure skating performances  think   if know day event looking took place  would help  but s still guarantee would included it seems dvd meant casual viewing  if would like sports rumbling tv  n t particular  might  it include highlights opening closing ceremonies  performances lindsay vaugn  shaun white  apollo ohno  but highlights  find   if find

3,a decent flick featuring good performance jurgen prochnow  became famous das boot  coincidentally  german version film called der skipper  liz hurley patsy kensit n t terrific actresses  certainly easy eyes 
5,several vignettes various lives taken seemingly magical summer eve masterfully described finland countryside  this n t ordinary prose  while reading book  i experienced emotions usually felt listening favorite music  looking desert sunset drinking fine nut brown  the words jump page  straight mind create vivid  colourful images imaginable  track copy book  s definately masterpiece

3,the original version the flying express poorly written book certain respects  the book slightly disjointed places perhaps point contains several glaring errors well known hardy enthusiasts  ie  the incorrect names given mrs hardy  chief collig  that said things aside pretty good book  as i child i held book high esteem  it story spies using train called flying express  it brothers task find spies camp bring justice  it bad book contains several errors otherwise great plot enjoyable read  more accurately i rate   star  story  star  errors within  star  rated b revision  the revision  memory dud  i may best person rate revision  i simply say i read impressed  its worth reading  ranks among bottom dwellers 
3,this review concerns revised edition  when new hydrofoil set begin taking passengers bayport cape cutlass  owner  fearing sabotage angry boat owners  asks frank joe along maiden voyage  arriving cape cutlass  frank joe  try help father case concerning gang stealing boating supplies  i hate reviewing books like really n t much say  the book neither excellent bad  average  the mystery n t better ones  however  boring either  i n t think fans series would rank book favourites  i n t believe many fans would disappointed book either

3,i purchased necklace gift  at amount discounted  i thought i would getting amazing deal price  the necklace i recieved pictured  stones smaller i believed be the necklace pretty  delicate  still nice gift  the stones nice light blue color  however  original price discount extremely overinflated  i would never million paid  necklace  the necklace n t look expensive  links made look moderately cheap  my price    probably correct value  disguised deep discount 
2,put necklace  n t even see either sparkle  beauty  the stones small  expected  what expected stones linked     meaning   stones seem soldered together  connected  stones  etc   this made awkward appearance worn since s  fluid   in words  necklace would  flip  constantly  saw silver  topaz   i considered keeping anyways price great  stones sparkly color pretty    wouldnt fitx around wrist x made large  worn bracelet sorts unfortunately  go back  i wish better designed movement stone laid better skin 
1,poorly made  washed stones  can use gifts quality terrible  would returned missed return deadline due travel  stuck 
4,very nicely constructed  service seller truly rare s excellence personally professionaly touch the zafu tiny bit smaller i expected  exactly  it expectation  great item 
4,i watched film cold saturday night year old grandfather warming fire entranced  after seen love hewitt playing teeny boppers angst ridden soap stars  refreshign well deserved change  she took mammoth task playing world s finest best know stars graciously played ability  the moving parts childhood  frances fisher brought usual grace dignity part audrey s mother complemented love hewitt perfectly  all  perfect rainy day film typical chick flick 
4,i thought honoring audrey hepburn wonderful idea ever since i found special  i wanted see  although  beginning  i particularly like hewitt s interpretation audrey  i watched times  performance grew  i find watching tape weekend weekend  hanging every word  waiting see happens next   even though i memorized   the story amazing different love struggles goes  my favorite moments proposals break ups  i think anyone likes good romantic flick would love movie  it definately worth watching 
1,as huge audrey fan i disgusted see jennifer love hewit cast play audrey biopic  not jlh resemble audrey way jlh n t act  fashion  i see another chance jlh overexposed something  i e  actress  singer   if buy recomend burning done 
3,obviously  jennifer love hewitt great respect love ms hepburn  get credit taking risk  but audrey actress  s icon  anyone taking role bound offend people  i familiar jennifer love hewitt s previous work  i eager check  she certainly beautiful screen presence  audey hepburn  least yet  ms hewitt miscast s ironic movie takes place filming  breakfast tiffany s   movie ms hepburn miscast  my real objection movie n t casting acting  s way movie plotted  the subject looking back on his her life plot become cliche  someone needs put new life biography movie 
2,jennifer love hewitt n t look thing like audrey hepburn  i truely believe producers casting directors made terrible call casting hewitt  the actress i believe reminds people audrey well looks like natalie portman  exceptional actress   natalie would made much mcuh better audrey hepburn 
3,this movie started slow bad it eventually got little better much it bit disappointment i feel percent accurate rather rushed it told audrey hepburn s childhood went acting career back childhood i really like audrey hepburn actress movie so i recommend see movies instead wish see n t let review stop you hope review helped 
1,did n t anyone courage tell puzzlingly popular jennifer love hewitt wrong role  by way  audrey hepburn s career breakfast at tiffany s  zero stars  zero 
1,jennifer love hewit realy fad trying play legend seems realy silly  for i actually liked jlh well maybey like i could stand seeing movie lost resepct  i n t think could play  though i think winona ryder ways reminds though doubt d tv movie  jennifer love hewit maybe admires audrey hepburn i still think movey bad idea  she could helped unacef s audrey hepburn probaly would remebered  they n t mention  okay five second unacef  showed two films made audrey hepburned made  i fond flim insulting audrey hepburn fans 
1,i saw movie television  i really excited i thought would interesting audrey hepburn favorite actresses  well   this movie awful   why earth would pick jennifer hewitt play audrey hepburn  natile portman might better choice  as others said  girl played younger audrey pretty good job  perhaps miss hewitt better actress shows movies  time  this movie could almost classified comedy  she n t even keep fake audrey voice throughout entire movie  use sounded like audrey word cat the actors played gregory peck william holden joke  awful n t look sound like either peck holden  the movie showed none audrey s later life  if missed seeing television  n t miss much  if still see  rent  might sorry buy first 
3,this movie started slow good  it got little bit better much  it bit disappointment i felt rushed percent accurate the movie talked childhood acting career childhood love life could get confusing i felt little dramatic like soap opera there disputes jennifer love hewitt playing audrey pretty good really play audrey except audrey herself i really like audrey hepburn actress i like movie much i like her i suggest watch movies instead wish see let review stop you i hope i helped 
4,i learned lot audrey hepburn s childhood i never realized  beginning wwii brought story home made real 
2,jlh terrible job portraying audrey hepburn  she seemed depressed time insecurity depiction much  jlh looks nothing like miss hepburn i n t konw given part  she elegance grace miss hepburn  head shaking thing waay much  her accent time  singing  although s good  sounded nothing like miss hepburn  they played recording instead  overall  i disappointed  others already said  natalie portman would much better miss hepburn 
2,sadly  movie suppose story greatest acting fashion legends  time   this movie poorly done  way honor tribute audrey hepburn being acting content story poor  smart thing proceed amazon books order   enchantment  the life audrey hepburn   
1,i could get passed fact whole movie love hewitt acting audrey  i get role  the accent everything  i spent whole  hours sitting watching movie  pressing pause commercial  thinking i might actually watch later  they better put audrey s movies dvd along order buy 
4,i found film especially performance lead actor hewett absolutely enchanting  born  i grew awareness audrey hepburn  tv tribute truly introduced magic star  i commend jennifer love hewitt performance thank reacquinting audrey  i ve recently ordered  classic hepburn movies i might truly experience beautiful actress fascinating culture days   later    for  film accomplished likely objective  i appreciate audrey hepburn much greater way  well done  buy video avoid commercials tv 
1,  compared piece tripe a lot people  including  thought audrey slaughtered film version my fair lady  personally  i forgave audrey error long ago  is movie payback  jennifer  get self  your horrid actress  i believe gotten far career  i never thought anyone could miscast themselves since jlh played audrey  s suggestions future movies legendary actresses   starr jones bette daviscindy crawford katherine hepburnrosanne marlene dietrichbea arthur marilyn monroeelizabeth berkley ethel mermantori spelling judy garlandif jlh play audrey  list plausable 
1,do n t bother watching movie  the facts wrong  the acting god  jlh tries best falls flat  if learn audrey read many books written watch a  e biography 
4,jennifer good job portraying beautiful legendary audrey  audrey hepburn  i enjoyed story much able get passed fact resemblance voice exactly like audrey s  i recommend story  heartwarming  expecting see exact duplicate audrey  rent audrey s old films  
5,this classic album  aloe blacc finds right mix electro funk classic hip hop make album diverse sound  highly recommended hip hop head 
1,the description jonbenet ramsey case lengthy  detailed boooooring  already known media   the  psychic part  chapter short   pages  short disappointing  author writes   i n t claim know    that s 
3,he did homework  i borrowed book friend nothing new say case  he knows nothing miss lizzie borden  i bet n t even know birthday crimes commited  middle  died  died  history  the needs read book it s finished i answers n t know  except really unsolved  a i right people 
3,first  book fascinating read  john douglas taken fascinating cases crime history  offered compelling arguments evidence   accuseds case  i love true crime books  interesting  descriptions evidence authorities work with but hand  s goes tangents  authorities done       around hand older cases  would cases locked  it s easy criticize distance years  i ll bet quite competent investigators case  best could time the author s shameless patting back books incredibly annoying  point i fast forward past objective parts 
4,n t necessarily shed new light  the first difficulty mr douglas s massive ego  the second problem  regardless unbiased thinks  look cases fresh eye  i found disagreeing almost  likely  suspects felt disregarded relevant information n t fit theories  i think mr douglas profiled cases preconceived notions  outcome would significantly different the book interesting look several famous cases  n t expect know whodunit finish book 
4,a good book  hard put  i hoping mr douglas going tell us who dun it case  cases old  instead  told us would handled today s technology personality profiling  still  interesting 
5,this book informed things i never known  i watch lot crime shows mark john go behind scenes explain actual process works  the difficulties solving crime making sure right person  very interesting read  could put 
4,if re looking good insights criminal behaviour   i liked learned things i n t already explored 
4,i like true crime analysis older cases interesting   details given opinions explored possible suspects  i felt sorry charles lindbergh wife  the ramsey case still baffles  police procedures gone wrong  scary thought   it made wonder lot killers actually really died still lurking wanting kill 
2,too many statements duratiion time profiling clear poor grasp human behavior   no mother would act way   vain  aging beauty queen mothers facingth birthday history dolling tights rouge preschool age children probably suspected behavior slightly different norm  interesting cases presented  interpretations behaviors superficial  lack insight  lack curiosity  why patsy ramsey unmoved sofa others reacted screams basement  duh  no clear answer would compose lengthy note without worry discovery  duh  i inspired seek authors insights 
2,wait paperback  this book rehash earlier works  it may interesting n t know much profiling  however  mindhunter much better book recycled effort  seems written primarily justify support ramseys  regarding ramsey case  presents credible scenarios incriminating paty and or john  immediately dismisses  absurd   his ego seems created quite blind spot 
4,thought book alot info crimes suspects  n t necessarily agree author s input jon benet ramsey murder s still good read  book makes protect children  
3,the world renowned douglas relies too heavily on the  research  of other writers in forming opinions       some of it is thinly disguised fiction  as in john gilmore s  severed   the black dahlia   or robert graysmith s eponymous  zodiac        sometimes he s right on target  lizzie   real close  jack the ripper   or  and i m sure most will agree  totally wrong  jon benet       douglas did not do his homework correctly here  and sometimes it shows badly       of course  with some of these ancient crimes  is it even possible to seperate fact from speculation anymore        other writers have devoted years of their lives to some of these cases  and they re totally lost  sometimes     maybe the complexity involved w most cases presented here defies encapsulation  which is basically what this book provides       john douglas should stick to the fresh crimes out there  its too late for the hopelessly distorted ones here      
1,mr douglas done great disservice profession work jonbenet ramsey case  his self serving patronizing chapter case incredible  i knew little case reading book  mr douglas certainly offered credible insight matter  there many holes theories i compelled completely disregard opinion entirely motivated ego  others defended integrity pointing point case refused payment services  sure useful ramsey s cooperation purpose writing book  example 
2,i thought book boring  i fascinated details cases  i think poorly written 
2,a dummy s guide understanding bizarre murder cases i would read new immigrant western world  so  would look around weightier books  specific crime topic this book broad informative enough the reason cases haunt fbi need turn light switch 
3,as noted  ramsey case written biased manner  placed first reader wonder information left cases  the book comes across self justifying  reviews said  in borden case   from experience  way stranger would      even maniac would n t hang around ninety minutes  would killed lizzie bridget   yet ramsey case  makes claim behavior  despite classifications  organized disorganized mixed  behavioural characteristics  s mostly lot arm waving building assumptions upon assumptions upon assumptions   though i admit many conclusions likely right  arguments get n t airtight  and s followup discussion jeff merrick  etc    
5,this great book person interested psychology  i know detectives psychologists delight interesting way douglas makes wisdom fbi available readers  the united states spent millions dollars researching psychology criminal behavior  surprize much quality information exists  douglas olshaker excellent job disseminating information fascinating way  researchers human behaviors note massive work done united states criminal mind 
5,one best books i ve ever read everyone read clear misconceptions regarding cases mentioned book  i refer often cases pops back news i hear new theory regarding cases 
3,detailed book  lots speculation  pretty interesting  many old cases  lizzie borden murder  lindberg kidnapping  etc not insightful books  interesting 
4,interesting investigations famous crimes past centurys recently  the author analyzes  investigates tells us victims popular notorious murder cases  some cases investigates jon benet ramsey murder  lindbergh baby kidnapping  zodiac killer  tons interesting info highly enjoyable read   stars good anyone interested crime murder investigations 
2,i ll try make short sweet  good book ultimately marred terrible chapter jonbenet ramsey murder  for chapter  mr douglas spends time attacking theories  character  credible law enforcement officials called illogical findings presented paid ramsey s lawyers  frankly  s little embarrassing  you blew  john   know it just glad see others posting similar comments final  regrettable chapter  book  it s amazing see someone much skill experience really  well  crap bed like

1,summer jams memorable think  hollaback girl  gwen stefani  oh  ciara  this song cassie totally forgettable  when i first heard  me  u  i thought okay  but hearing           nth times  i decided song weak  the music sounds like looped cassie sings like s half asleep  there emotion intensity song  none  it s bland dreary  but i guess s sample s upcoming album  anywho  song already forgotten like bowl ramen noodles hot sauce checks 
1,my cd of cassie s me and you skips throughout the cd  this is thend time i ve received a cd from amazon that has skipped  this will be the last time i order any cd s from amazon  this is very frustrating as i feel i ve spent my hard earned money on this thanks for nothing    
4,i first heard song car radio smooth whistle melody sythesized bass caught attention  it s songs turn bass back relax  the vocals nothing special  instrumental alone gives song unique vibe  i m excited see rest album offers 
3,i wish i could give bs cd damn  stars  the good thing cassie looks  i downloaded junk file sharing  and i money back  that s  cd   the reason i gave cd  stars  s sexy mug  it s  shame wasted nice piece technology  cd  voice  she need  back myspace leave singing folks know 
1,cassie bad  resort stripping panties video clip get music sales  you know definately got talent  like looks  she ashanti  even less talent  hahaha  her voice sounds like raised dead  voice sounds lazy song quite boring  she got vocal talent 
5,this book advertised used  i n t know used never opened  i m finding useful guide fully use table saw  the drawing excellent jigs i ve made far actually work 
3,better illustrated previous two editions  remarkable number errors picture captions pertaining year model descriptions  anyone using  last word  reference better look elsewhere 
2,if likednd editon standard catalog cadillac  ll undoubtedly disappointed edition  this edition trades lasalle information price guide color photos cadillacs  while lasalle price guide gone completely  cadillac price guide unbelievably incomplete  leaving pricing    through   this edition leaves lot desired true cadillac lasalle aficionado 
5,you will really enjoy  acoustic journey   it takes you on a musical trip to diverse places around the world and delivers a masterful interpretation of each work as though it were his own  my favorite tune on the cd is  blue chili  and dimitri s tango   blue chili  is like a slow blues jam with some jazzy stuff thrown in as well as some rock n roll riffs   tango en paraiso  is a wonderful tropical groove that makes me want to order a pina colada and sit out by the pool  i highly recommend this cd to anyone who just digs good music 
2,i contractor twenty years  fairly successful  im sitting local cigar shop i regular basis i meet harvey  author   talk  tells book  i read  well fourth reading  still picking new thoughts  i recomended book many fellow contractors  due ease reading simple principles forget time time  all i say great insight simply stated 
1,a little frustrated seller  i bought book realized i got wrong  okay  fault  i tried contact return ever subtly refused contact back  tried couple times  this book good  i first  amazing  aesthetically appealing  the cover made think would bunch artists like first computer based artist artists paint far loosely  maybe would appeal  lot  i n t know  work tighter book n t inspire like first  overall  though  seller sucks 
4,what anyways  i think entire premise book based history concept secularism definitions associated  because legal background  feldman draws together cases helped shape america s history behind cases  it interesting see america s idea secularism changed  this book well complimented stark finke s  acts faith    habits heart  bella 
3,this book valuable students terms providing historic background rise secularism us  the conclusion  however rather flawed presupposes level civility  present future  among parties somewhat naive  a lot unwarranted  shoulds   other authors  notably william connolly  raise similar points considered framework 
2,feldman attempts  solve  church state tensions dividing country two camps  secularists evangelicals  this starting premise dooms book  he bought evangelicals  rhetoric  rather actual array beliefs issues  those opposition evangelicals anti religion  term  secularist  implies  rather vast majority circumstances religious  the debate relgion u s reduced simple dichotomy  this ivory tower worldview  untouched empirical reality 
3,very interesting review many issues surrounding god  whatever definintion god  comments becomes repetitive awhile  many good points made  just needs condensed

5,the reviews good  trouble right dvd becoming unavailable  this import spoken english  n t worry  subtitles turned  it s full wide screen  the credits cut short music stops  spoils mood   middle credits   there s bit nudity rees the title may mislead people thinking s cheap gore film  no  s literate masterpiece  based serious novel

4,watching film  heart aches s much talent display never got work together length film  sudden sense much richer golden age hollywood musicals could african americans given due    anyhow  like everyone else i m wowed especially lena horne nicholas brothers dance sequence  the latter probably single amazing physical achievement dance ever  ll see  believe saw  ll irresistably driven show people  which fair  nobody without seen 
4,the connecting thread review african american entertainment spanning world wars reminisces hoofer bill williamson  bill robinson   this light hearted pretense show rich tapestry african american contribution collective culture  and great gathering contributors  robinson  lena horne  cab calloway  fats waller  nicholas brothers  etc  everybody s top game full knowledge opportunity strut stuff major hollywood production would n t afforded often  the performances infectuously joyful betraying pain many probably felt discriminated  i approached film initially sociological experience point i sucked fun 
4,my parents used rave film  lena horne title song became signature tune  finally i ve caught wait worthwhile  this film beautifully restored soundtrack clean whistle  i never seen fats waller perform whole song let alone two  we see cab calloway prime  younger audiences catching years later  the blues brothers   the dancing original  mr bojangles   nicholas brothers renowned katherine dunham dance troupe beathtaking  lena horne beautiful gowns accentuate beauty  it highly recommended i must register feeling sadness seeing all black cast movie way go back  stage performers even wear blackface top natural complexion 
4,as young watching movie  instilled since pride dignity knowing challenges stop greatness forever preserved dvd  i d agree great gregory hines known statment   the best tap dance number film   nicholas brothers big white staircase   these brothers stole show  get library 
2,let s frank  this terrible movie  racial stereotypes  might expect  abound  demeaning say least  the plot weak barely exists  the acting dreadful  the choreography lousy  and heart love story year old year old woman  as robinson s dancing  well  nicholas brothers stars regard  and exactly cab calloway s talents  there positive side movie  it lena horne  she s delight  three standard songs film  horne deserved better  time great talents would recognized  stormy weather seen historical context  blacks needed effort  rare nod entertainers major studio 
4,this film showcase black song and dance entertainers first halfth century  the plot   thin simply involved romance lena horne bill bojangles  robinson  releasedth century fox  black and white  we thomas fats  waller singing playing ai n t misbehavin   cab calloway orchestra frenetic thing geechy joe  rhythm cocktail   acrobatic dancing nicholas brothers  full supporting cast singers dancers  dooley wilson appeared n t given anything sing play  the high spot film lena horne s singing title track harold arlen ted koehler  hand screenplay  an enjoyable entertainment 
3,lena horne  bill robinson  cab calloway  fats waller nicholas brothers  great performers  actually  bill robinson may little past best  final number  feels though s warming  s finished  i m saying s bad  based reputation  i d hoped little  but performer would overshadowed nicholas brothers  dancing  incredible mixture energy acrobatics  i saw film today  i d assume d digital manipulation however  great performances stitched together dull plot  we re given characters  romance perfunctory  though actors n t even trying convincing  lots classic moments  adds good film  great 
4,i saw netflix buying dad  he plays trumpet loves jazz standards  this film great scenes upbeat 
5,how could love movie  it lena horne  cab calloway amazing artists  the music numbers blend seamlessly story line  this star studded cast anyone anyone back day  incredible  i still love day  i seen times i count  it neat see favorite people back young  way cool 
5,this another old movies i watch appreciate  this largely singing dancing film  at times much times awesome  before watching film i d never seen cab calloway perform watched whole film lena horne  both entertainers great job  if re interested classy entertainment early black actors film watch 
4,to say made forties  i think excelent musical  better ones even story line medioca  music thesongs terrific  g jackson 
3,this movie starts good  kinda loses track  the dance scenes excellent cool zoot suit scene  fats waller bojangles best makes nice watching  swing dancers add collection
3,remembering true period piece film   stormy weather   nonetheless delightful difficult view  it s standard black stereotyping nothing enhance miserable plot bad acting  yet  performances fats waller  cab calloway  bill  bojangles  robinson impressive nicholas brothers wonderful  lena horne  sings signature piece   stormy weather   course  if get past dialogue  much merit film 
2,i bought dvd i missed seeing local theatre features old films  i disappointed story n t good interesting  however  i wanted see dancers  step brothers  i think called  fantastic dance stairs  that unbelievable  also wanted see beautiful lena horne  disappointed n t beautiful gowns  so  step brothers dancing  i bored

2,fish hooks     a portly george c scott reprises role classic patton  too bad movie awful  briefly stated  sequel made  the flimsy dialog  poor editing  cumbersome made for television format justice francis ford coppola s original epic  be sure note expanding belt line   months movie time  scott looked like d hanging marlon brando years films 
1,i would give rating movie  stars  picture quality dvd dismal  it almost watchable  the picture blurry  like watching old tv broadcast rabbit ear antenna 
2,the original patton motion picture masterpiece favorite movies  george c scott genius favorite actors  i happy find movie amazon demand  disappointed movie itself looks like low budget made tv movie is casting poor  outside george c scott bunch b c actors  richard dysart eisenhower particularly bad as noted many reviews  video quality poor way long way depressing i hoping movie would cover postwar patton less george c scott lying hospital bed  if cut last third movie  might four stars i recommend pass movie  least stop watching accident  he suffers paralyzed hospital bed  there nothing useful point lot overacting 
2,good sequal  patton   worthy addition original  the quality dvd however leaves alot desired  my copy looks like copy made vhs tape  but  cent  shipping i guess i n t complain 
3,just popped dvd  i m sure i ll enjoy i love patton s history i see right  goerge c scott form major theater predecessor this release brentwood indeed poor transfer reviewers mentioned  i notice appears recent release slightly higher price  perhaps better in case    i m going complain 
3,i watched dvd last night  the best thing george c scott playing general patton  this movie made scott looks older less energetic  there battle action  the drama consists mostly political inter personal reactions generals opinions ideas concerning defeated germans russians  noted movie  patton   of historical interest  accident lead death hospitalization afterwards depicted detail 
4,i purchased streaming version tv movie  historally  s pretty accurate tv movies go  the problem streaming amazon instant video pretty choppy  there s studder every two minutes makes pretty distracting  amazon needs work video movie  but    expect 
3,this movie was the sequel to part i  general george s patton  tank commander   this was part documentary as well as being a movie   this did not show much  blood and guts  as his first movie    
2,i found movie disappointing  i guess patton anything else would hard compare  that said  i high hopes given fact i enjoyed original much  i even get half way becoming bored plot  stick original  sorry 
4,history  military enthusiasts enjoy film  however  recreation patton s car  accident  match facts known actual events  accident  scene  recent evidence witness testimony suggests car crash pre meditated act assassinate patton major cover up potential crime scene occurred event  the truth behind patton s demise remains fully told film leaves facts  patton s legacy deserves better 
4,george c scott reprises role pattonnd part movie  patton  it picks movie left  wwii tragic car accident left patton paralyzed  eva marie saint climbs aboard mrs patton  beautifully done 
4,ladislas farago wrote definitive biography general george s patton back s    book upon film george c scott based  even though patton little older  fatter wiser film  still coveys historical accuracy general s final days  scott s portrayal patton lost none personality deserves rightful place volume two patton story 
3,i love patton original spin sequel think destroys first movie portrayed i would never watch  its insulting

1,not recommended non neoconservatives believe true justice  the author rightwing politics  the neonazi neocons complain activist judges promoting set process  if believe losing constitution turning country theocratic dictatorship  buy book join losers 
1,as expected book endorsed edwin meese george bush  book talks permit right wing fascism undermining balance power afforded judicial branch  phyllis typical form  blasting judges things ending segregation protecting human rights  like another reviewer said  past title nothing new  if see people like reverend pat mahoney  pat robertson jerry falwell get ideas destroy country breaking balance power build murderous theocracy  book 
1,i knew mrs schlafly s ideas reading columns townhall  book therefore taught nothing new  if read book description displayed  need buy book her point  modern judges bad job interpret constitution instead listening majority 
1,you n t throw baby bathwater  if feel judicial system flawed held accountable  would n t argument checks balances less  so really  i believe author afraid social evolution  evidenced books   although i n t understand  without could n t author  lawer  columnist  and mother six  anyways  would like replace judges know alls like  she good job presenting facts back agenda  misses evidence system proposes would doomed fail  after  history shows us ugly death previous theocracies  if afraid moving forward  book  if save money book balance 
3,well  best time review book s clear  least next four years  fewer  supremacists   judicial lawmakers  writing laws rather interpreting  only courts left able succeed pushing cultural agenda  schlafly reviews suprising number cases book illustrate way judges become powerful forgers government legistlators actually elect  her case strong book readable  however  i would recommend waiting paperback comes book far short worth full price  it helpful primer though us fading memories marbury v madison ex parte mccardle

2,the recipe instructions inconsistent ridiculously overcomplicated   great  pumpkin pie  example  the instructions say bake pie directly oven floor  if gas oven heats bottom  getting nothing burnt pie  thanks thanksgiving failure  rose   designer apple pie nice  trick boiling apple juices slick  but cream cheese crust  i ve better results joy cooking recipes  her recipes fragile reproduced consistently  if degree oven  minute timing  forget  pie ruined  other pie recipes less sensitive  working crust recipes like walking eggshells i ve making pies years  i n t say details make berenbaum s recipes complicated make pies much better ones i ve made past cookbooks  very disappointing 
4,good recipes  easy follow instructions pictures  i think author famous rose levy spend little pictures 
2,i ve book since year nought  but i never made anything  having said i currently cubed butter flour mixture freezer  my first stab making pie tome  obviously rating  stars reflect quality recipes  it s reserved wonderful folks scribner  i think ms beranbaum might world s gifted cake pie bread maker certainly needs bit help comes picking publisher  my cake bible  fell apart quickly pages could n t wait detach feeble spine  this happened pie bible coz i said  i ve never used  the sections well organized refer back forth annoying  a couple built in bookmarks  like gourmet cookbook  would helpful  anyway  i go day reviewers beaten

3,this machine worked fine years makes great coffee   bad side seat filter basket perfectly ground two clogs little hole  coffee runs floor and irritating thing beeps machine finishes  they loud enough wake house way shut off c mon cuisinart  give consumer control 
5,this fictional story  might well real taiwanese  the story starts near lukang kmt soldiers steal god family sent bring back  much story focuses around american newsman stationed taipei learns nationalist taiwan seems  the true story behind fiction sneider ed paine  eye witness massacre paine hooked sneider interpreter  the history fuzzy  places  story allegory s taipei dreaded race track deaths  this book considered rare following years kmt student spies stealing libraries   review  maowang forumosa
3,this book worthwhile simply subject  but revelations  merely conslidates information appeared articles interviews years  the interviews rewarding  edited coherence attribution  the writing trite  hackneyed  author frequently inserts biased opinions story  and number factual blunders calls apparent research question  disappointing  sometimes apalling  game town 
3,i fairly recent  since  fan rt  i ve always wanted know person artist  the interviews good  especially ones bandmates current wife ex wife  however politics album details really bog reader  i appeciate context  sometimes much  still  book fascinating parts i recommend fans 
3,humphries concentrates history thompson s recording career  that involves double reduction  life work largely reduced career  career largely reduced recording career  the result woefully narrow  book could called genius as marginality  problems in the marketing of richard thompson  to make matters worse  humphries weak grasp difference achievement reception  reader wants know albums buy find told ones well received   clive gregson   i n t believe richard ever really bothered making records  it s real thing    yet interesting quotes  articulate thompson perceptive wives  friends  colleagues  critics  their voices made book pleasure read

5,ottfried preussler  german ww ii veteran  wrote book  my krabat tells     personal story  story generation story young people get touch power temptations become entangled   the story based old wendish  west slavic  takes small part parable totalitarian systems  run means force seduction individuals get away it interesting see miller described demonic master   later human slave haunting journeyman thus serves cog wheel evil system 
5,i purchased replacement e powered mtb  i gates belt stretch pretty quick  it n t break  stretching bothered  i installed goodyear belt able push power belt without keep adjusting tension 
3,two lifeships crash uninhabited planet  passengers must struggle survive the storyline fairly simple adventure survival  lots detail  it somewhat like golding s classic  less gruelling  bit faith human nature first trilogy    the avengers carrig   the repairmen cyclops
4,brunner rightly famous masterpieces stand zanzibar  shockwave rider  sheep look up  however  earlier pulpish sci fi polymath actually pretty good survival interesting planet  secondly  i find slight disturbing nature annoying  perhaps since i managed read sheep look up tons philip k dick  yes  captain gnomes unbelievable  villains   fiction   however devia lex suprisingly well rounded characters brief book probably took brunner months write  for hundred fifty four pages suprisingly good read  
3,you pay attention within    the simple  dont think much  survivalthe past  furrows  anywasy pondered ploted well tilled  garden of thoughts  would happen  tommorrow  awfull jobs done and deeds done to insure  pragmatised erotised theorised  nearly death indetail stuns  explodes insight the follys proabably shall still embrace far tommorrows yesteryear  brunner makes clear again and again its clear he thinks it worth doing  all the brilliant crap  dont me nothing if you dont stir in the essentials  like equation author examines plain tell home spun  good versus  bad survivalist yarn  future science glory hard boiled collide alien natural  
1,after starting read first many stories book  i closed n t read rest  i like fiction fiction story made someone else s head  i thought would true stories  so like fiction  like book  if true stories  i prefer   it s fault disappointed book merely fiction  i guess s good book   like fiction 
4,the taste sensational well liked guests  it tastes like frango mint chocolates would purchase marshal fields  the price seems little high 
5,i highly recommend version sherlock holmes mystery  richardson suits role holmes well  bringing confidence intellectual flare solving case i n t critical much movie  i enjoyed immensely vhs   dvd  it s well acted  well scripted  well produced  i think ian richardson favourite sherlock holmes  although i n t think played role many times actors  again  brings confidence ability  viewer n t really think s going solve mystery thumbs  enjoy 
2,a disappointing movie  clich ridden directing  cardboard scenery  acting i feel dated  despite presence great ian richardson young martin shaw  the low point imo ian cuthbertson  often featured days  acting solely means raging shouting rrrolling eyes rrrolling r  
1,i m fan ian richardson s fu series i saw tapes finally available sherlock holmes i immediately bought  they re awful  he n t play holmes well action slow stagey  even damn credits long roll beginning  mothers  tell children i done  save your money watch jeremy brett instead  richardson seems like natural role  s disappointment 
2,i made mistake watching kids family church sunday  i idea would rape scene  for kids stick halmark version matt frewer 
2,i could watch movie way  i found acting sub par especially american actor  i hoping scenery old england would hold movie scenery n t even good  the sherlock holmes series aired television better dvd  perhaps i give dvd gift movie buff 
1,it seems object writer see much could rewrite still keep connection original story  for example blessed booth s characters changed father daughter husband wife lestrade would look foolish arresting husband wife s murder  nothing film works i gave charity  if ian richardson sherlock holmes get the sign four 
4,douglas hickox among directors understood mystic horror doyle s terrifying masterpiece  directing brilliant nicholas clay  hickox presents audience best film version story date   stars 
4,the movie well put together  thought  i really liked stick fairly close story  change things  i m sure best  i like hound holmes fight  happen movie  i n t like mrs lions murdered  n t happen either   all  i d give four five stars  the acting supurb  i got chills listening sound hound   
5,this session begins shimmering peal gong  enter somber  mysterious intense world john coltrane   love supreme   poem great tonal color emotion  hailed coltrane s religious awakening new period embarked mission uplift people  prior recording album  coltrane s faith tested bombing black church alabama  death eric dolphy tumults   civil rights  change  new music  new worlds  all coltrane s recorded work  love supreme  forward groundbreaking every level  this listeners new coltrane  wish hear mainstream coltrane prestige  blue train  period  this serious listener seeking different challenging experience sound  history 
5,the negative reviews people poor taste poor ears  as review trying to write ebonics  titled  what s hype    idiot garden city  mi united states  white guys fronting black guys easily discerned knowing  know  playa hatin  white boy  now  album  this pure music comes undiluted soul highly evolved empathetic human  knows depths ecstasies human soul  genius express every shade gigantic wisdom understanding you n t need look jazz encyclopaedia throw words around understand  people usually trying show lack soul a healer plays sounds  medicine  coltrane truly bodhisattva 
2,okay already  i m convinced chops  you n t keep trying impress       this album encapsulates fatal flaw jazz music  element relegating dustbin history  form substance  nobody technical achievements guys years  many except confuse self obsession depth   there moments  especially middle section  coltrane co hint melodic structure  level aesthetic appeal  inevitably stylized flourish ruins everything  i suppose s good someone pushed repetitive droning squawking  envelope  really listen  art reaches  speaks universal  appeals heart  jazz excludes  speaks code  demands analysis  i prefer art 
2,i like title  i understand people excited  i mean  sixties really breakthrough  i guess  but many sax players play better coltrane  much polished straight  i think kenny g  instance  his rythmic session much regular  whereas coltrane s session seems sometimes loose beat  and coltrane really precise   but title interesting least historical recording  first step towards perfection todays players 
5,for seeking ultimate jazz experience the album  man seeks meaning finding beautiful aesthetic  coletrane helped us find moment think moment recorded  a love supreme stands right border beauty chaos  while many later avant garde works even later works coletrane run past border become difficult listen  a love supreme remains realm listener allowed enter experience artist  a love supreme ultimate jazz album the classic  
5,john coltrane s expressionistic existentialist masterpiece released superbly remastered edition essential additional material  this album turning point coltrane  away past material closer hard bop realms free jazz  this picked atonalities would trademark later recordings gives listener chance  spiritually rich expressionistic  jazz s greatest albums  if original album  worth purchase additional disc  outtakes album archie shepp included  full length concert time album performed publicly  by time  coltrane picked dissonance later albums listeners less satisfying appreciate coltrane complexity  well appreciated  highly recommended 
5,i enjoy jazz   i m far thoroughly versed style though  i key discs collection  s  a love supreme  a lot good music sets mood  coltrane s disc really talks   s amazing  where musicians hint idea  coltrane rattles spiritual epic  if re looking add stimulating  startling jazz collection  re talking kenny g     disc 
5,john coltrane best recording  some people dislike believe excessively serious  deeply emotional even joyful  it really takes open mind  concentration  enjoy cd properly  reward listener energy expends musically  would absurd attack recording  writing  improvisation  interaction flawless one word warning  if someone listens music simple entertainment background  cd  listening cd background would like reading sleep james joyce s  ulysses   it really boils see music  some people n t think music deeply expressive artistic outlet  s fine  n t enjoy cd 
5,all needs said  a love supreme     buy it  if disc collection  missing vital pieces music ever recorded  no matter musical tastes  i guarantee find something interest trane s visceral evocative performance  a classic sheer beauty emotion  peace 
5,  i wonder much awesome result due rudy van gelder re mastering process rather dsd sacd new teach  i wonder sometimes music major trying sell us n th remastering try make us re buy music collection  it would nice compare re mastering hi rez dvd a dsd sacd btw i astonished much better compared vynil  i buy red book cd waiting hi rez re issue      stars music  i d vote  starts possible     stars sound
5,john coltrane    long winded   from first  breath  swan song know  love supreme  safe playing taken exremes    maybe best long composition jazz tazzthe live stuff hits hard
4,i ll first admit i really n t know much jazz john coltrane  but search something different i picked cd  it certainly departure   rock world  i love  it adventurous compelling  if like wondering fuss  go ahead give cd spin  ll glad  there whole new world inside 
3,i really jazz fan  i bought taking jazz class college putting aside spiritual theme  john s gift god  comments  i comment instrumental music  i always get distinct feeling repetitive  title track  instance  repeated four note theme starts getting monotonous   lot songs n t really going anywhere  i hard time style  it sounds like bunch notes  nothing i would term  catchy   nothing latch onto really remember s done  something i really like dixieland  cool  swing styles jazz music i start thinking instrumental music representing theme coltrane s so called spiritual awakening  album would gained much respect  taking music alone  instrumental jazz music  i admit i grow weary fast 
5,john coltrane truely ahead time  vacuum tubes still state art album came  yet  fidelity pretty amazing   jimmy garrison down shifting bass first cut   acknowlegement  aka  love supreme   elvin jones mckoy tyner rounding things  blew my mind  if do n t  feel   no soul 
3,this review music  the music course awesome  but get copy record today hole drilled way  label side barely stuck  this first record purchased lately badly drilled holes poor label application once drilled hole properly record plays great 
5,said record n t  i beg pardon  n t say  record party  s ears  this pure joy  guy gave star like jazz  listen late night girlfriend broke  life affirming s hopeful taps emoticons beyond  knew would make copy s cheap enough  check screwed impress lady  either way score 
5,this album may serve acid test  n t like  n t like jazz  never  the flawless interplay four voices work builds upon came anticipates came  those n t like  far  usually aggressively drowsy conservatives listen coltrane wishing listfully genius arrived scene disturb sanguine haze american music late s  a love supreme created new musical idiom depth human sentiment could commiunicated  a towering accomplishment 
3,after reading context coltrane s autobiography  i thought i would either hate love  when i listened i surprised find i liked  it s good example avant garde jazz sounds good  s far s hard listen  influences earlier types jazz combined classical sensibility  a spiritual feeling sense 
3,the sound quality performance extra tracks n t add anything original recording 
3,i tried tried listen release  i appreciate lot jazz artists  especially trumpeters  s something sax s tone puts sleep  and trane puts every time  not s peaceful dreamy  because i find coltrane boring   okay i ve said  i m guilty heinous lack cool  committed hearsay  blasphemy even  that said  ornett coleman is inspirational  trane  keep rolling right outta   would n t bother bit  no offence intended  s opinion

2,this product i got yesterday n t features connected mitsubishi  it seemed work ok i actually tried record something would lose connection  will probably return i n t get stable weekend 
4,this product fits perfectly wrists  it s light time adds little variety workout  if beginner like  i highly recommend product 
2,i     weighlbs tiny hands wrists  these weights tiny  barely stretch  i hardly even get wrists  plus  lb weight nearly enough 
1,discription says pound wrist weights  product received pound wrist weights  a deceptive rip off 
1,i recently purchased wrist weights  thinking i d able use ankle weights  i could n t get foot  completely understandable fact wrist weights  this would fine fact weights n t even fit hands  i quite skinny  pretty small  even i tried best get wrist  i cutting circulation i n t know kind fluke  definitely small  i n t use i sending back 
3,for ex  never used  thought expensive paperweights  they  pass 
5,these super soft  like silky terry cloth  these bit small side medium large framed woman s wrist  however  perfect child s wrist even ankle  these used child s therapy  fit perfectly  yr old s wrists ankles  very comfortable 
3,its seemed like would good product  the material felt nice  it impossible put wrist
1,the day i received tore open little beads grannules inside started  mention i   inch wrist small hands difficult slip hands onto wrists  i dont see anyone larger hands wrists could wear  my advice dont waste money tear worth shipping send back  
3,these work great really small  i really small hands wrists difficult get  i thinking wrap around velcro kind i ordered 
2,i really excited adding cardio workout  add bit weight without feeling much  that idea anyway  the issue n t fit well  way adjust  i m   tall woman proportions go height  i m dainty  these tight wrists start  i wore times thinking use material would stretch bit  material came apart seams sand inside started spill  even n t that tight  i would n t thought would fall apart  even fit i imagine would n t last long for smaller people work fine  people robust  including  simply n t work well  i wish adjustable kind came lighter weights 
2,as soon i opened package i knew something n t right sand inside  i put later day sand arm  i finally found hole weights  not happy say least 
2,ca n t say good product really got way i typing computer work  my doctor suggested tremors uncomfortable  you may like using  not negative review personal choice review 
3,on picture  wrist weights look like sleek modern design  instead get fabric feels rough like sack cloth instead smooth texture lycra i expecting  in words look feel like bean bags attached wrists  i guess get pay  plus  work  s matters 
1,i actually disappointed thing  second time i wore  little rocks coming sown together  and annoying thousand little rocks shoe walking around 
3,one weights started leaking sand seem uses  i used little duct tape patch held many months  but still  really   
2,it hurts wrist slip  it would much better velco strip something could wrap around wrist instead force 
5,i small  tiny wrists weights fit fine great enhancement daily workout  in fact i wear almost everyday day long except i sleeping 
4,the product well made small easily get hands place wrists   once comfortable but lite needs   made small people i think i look bigger set  
3,i m average height woman  medium boned  slightly overweight obese  i could get wrists  took effort  i took  minutes  they right weight i use  i think would better way make open  velcro  snaps  elastic would made worth   stars  as  n t work well adults  especially larger adults 
4,i agree reviews thin wrists fit be comfortable  i m quite petite hard time slipping wrist weights 
1,i used weights  well  almost made it one wrist weights came apart seam sand leaked carpet 
2,the wrist weight size may used tiny thin adult lbs child  i could get hand wrist  the advertising say size hand needs use 
3,great accompany advanced weight regiments  however  depending wrist size  might overstretching put causing seems unravel contents bit 
2,so purchased weights days ago appeared comfortable  but days  cloth started expand sand started seep  this product good first days purchase 
3,not bad price  adjustments  i large hands wrist  fit little tight little hard get  but trick 
2,let start saying nothing  wrong  weights  the quality great  material soft  however  people say small   mean  i petite size  barely fit  i actually got therapy use one year old s ankles one pounders i could find  they fit chuncky little perfectly 
3,these say  pound wrist weights read information better  wrist weights  pound  i n t know advertised like  other valeo products pairs  like lb hand weights  advertised pounds get two pounds hand weights  uh why  they fit hands wrist fine

5,first  music zelda ocarina time matches setting  example  listen water temple music  people get image watery icy place  game s songs impressed many people sure  game already great self  music takes next level 
5,i loved compositions game i think nobuo uematsu great composer  fitting perfect music perfect environments however  i could abide repetative synthesised instruments accompanied music occasions  i recently bought original ff  thinking perhaps implemented real instruments but luck then i saw  absolutely amazing   a single pianist plays greatest ff tracks  clever re arrangements  listen  fully imersed final fantasy atmosphere  my highlight must card game theme  shuffle boogie   excellent bar blues  anyway  yes  buy  also get japanese packaging   always good  bizarre reason little plastic see though sheath real case goes   lovely 
4,just like final fantasy music collections  cd  must have   although s best uematsu   since theme final fantasy viii  love   cd gives sense sweet  loving relaxing  the first track  blue fields  followed super hit   eyes   track newly rearranged  but still good   the rest cd gives sensation  i find cd good relaxing day bed time everytime i listen  i like  as i said  like final fantasy series uematsu s work  like cd 
2,i travel extensively fan frommer s guides i generally find nice assortment options varying price ranges  the volume south africa however  great disappointment  if frommer s believed  pay  decent room  fortunately i often traveled south africa  enjoyed reasonably priced accomodations  knew prices nonsense  i stayed cape town  johannesburg  durban top destinations season less half much  the guide overlooked destinations bit beaten path proved little use i n t bother pack home  i strongly suggest eyewitness guide instead surf web tons great information south african tourism board

1,we fans frommer s guide books previous trips choose book amazon com without reviewing old fashioned way  browsing pages sections  too late discovered book barely mentioned destination points  pretoria  tshwane   private game reserve bordering kruger national park  we missed where dine  suggestions places interest in near pretoria  particularly helpful past in addition  found least map reference sent reader page corresponding text map cross reference  we ended leaving book home

2,an interesting story  author tried much pages  too many characters many voices resulted somewhat awkward full flat  one note caricatures  at first  i found somewhat misogynistic  first hundred pages lacked single female character n t monster  nutjob  complete waste oxygen  i read  i realized male characters n t better   being un christian  especially un catholic  i n t  get  lot horror aspects book  either  ho hum  succubus killing someone else  next  this author s first novel  though  maybe next attempt better  not horrible book  compelling enough finish plane 
3,michael marono superb writer  his style beautiful  his descriptive prose original nothing deviate story  fact  enhances  my problem book simply many characters  it got real annoying trying remember names storylines  plus  i hated author would begin new segment three four paragraphs descriptive writing without informing reader heck talking  dawn song good solid story comes across convoluted times 
5,as fan horror genre i often forced book well known author although major affect scaring wits  rarely gets deep personal life  mr marano succeeded others failed  from moment i picked book  i could n t put i finished story the story two princes hell trying world gripping frightening  left wanting author  his style prose amazing of course real good stuff emotional roller coaster get privilege almost page  this book takes everywhere  sorrow hopeful  taking little pitstops emotion along way with characters i could really feel  struggle earth beautiful mix great insight moments pure suspense pick  s great read

2,i enjoyed storyline charactor development  it good read    spoilt cumbersome presentation arty  expression  i looking story theme promised got lost litteray world  why n t writers present ideas thoughts simply  complexity equate quality   i deplore trend many horror novel nowadays statutary gay component  what s wrong bit plain old spine chilling touch straight side  when i finished story i desperately looking another author  compare  the stake   crota  fun reads 
2,well written probably would enjoyed plot able follow  lost interest lost book   sweat back  nothing special would probably better going library 
1,mr marano s story wanders   wanders   wanders  his characters n t interact  development pointless  this book fully pages long  how long demons hell stir existence still keep attention  not pages  there good moments  succubus inhabiting mouse  far  the premise novel promising  i excited read  and i let completely  mr marano  please  next time good idea story  please write story  epic adventure style

5,not fun second album  accessible first   probably best whole album sdre  some great songs    two promises     million  title track  guitar video games  stand sdre s best does require couple listens get truly  rewarding 
4,i m actually giving   stars  i huge sdre fan  i cd s contains favorite sdre songs ones i like least  pillars  every shining time  what it feels like to be something on amazing  they beautiful complex alone worth    however  roses water prophet standards i set sdre  otherwise  amazing cd best indie alternative rock bands s  i definately recommend buying  diary   excellent debut cd  n t already 
4,i like album lot  there s lot power swirling guitars  melodies knock flat  enigk s soaring tenor tremendous  every shining time arrive classic     title contains dirty word  beautiful jarring transitions i ve heard years  great cd on another note  i think s funny previous reviewer  heidikakis ny  lifted almost    review pitchforkmedia com   why would someone  i m sure folk pitchforkmedia com n t pleased 
2,when i bought album  i felt like crying  my favorite band  sunny day real estate  reformed i thrilled  then i actually heard cd  slap  sunny day sounds nothing like  diary    lp   anymore  they rather watered down alternative rock   every shining time you arrive  definetely great song  s song cd would make buy  let s   sunny day dead  first two cds makes legendary 
2,this album plainly dissapointment  half album brilliant half  well put e p  half songs  sure pillars  every shining time  how feels  brilliant  but ruined million  two promises  roses water  i expected best album  hearing jeremy s solo album  must buy  turns studio  means much emotion  sure jeremy screaming  nothing scream  maybe nate important ll admit  the emo slightly emo  not alt rock  do n t start  buy diary  hear promising bands time used sound like  maybe n t gotten back together

5,i read husband buy college course actually really good play read   the part i hate reading plays keeping says straight 
4,this first play i ve read anton chekhov i interested russian culture  good play read fall russian aristocracy  however  i n t think characters fully developed could  nonetheless  i truly enjoyed reading play hopefully day i watch stage 
2,the packaging allowed something stab thepaper book ruin bottom two pages  i repaired tape  itcould used anyone  i keep however 
1,although chekov s play accurately reflects decline aristocratic powerth century russia  unfulfilling  mdm  ranevskaya s orchard bought feet  friend  whose hunger profit motivated friendship  so transformative moment  mdm  ranevskaya loses cherished possession   her friend  lopahin  feins innocense  mdm  ranevskaya runs paris  we never find  it s sort like biting pretty good apple fall ground 
3,the item great condition  however  package got lost mail shipped another copy  i received  i grateful  i really needed book early wait almost month receive copy 
1,reading book  though short  incredibly large waste time  it confusing  badly written pointless  reading book plot hidden choppy sentences weird russian words contributed dislike book  take advice  going read book dont read bed definatly fall asleep 
1,  the cherry orchard  atrocious play  if hold play high regard  dramatist s need reevaluate standards  chekhov wrote play make inch character s situation    for think comedy makes wonder understood point trying make  the characters pathetic ll make pity  predicaments   i recommend 
1,this book lost credibility i read authors  attack fundamentalism  i former fundamentalist  i might expected apostate s bias fundamentalism  authors inaccurate almost comically biased  the authors claim fundamentalists  belief truth bible  borders idolatry   fundamentalists  often parasitic  define belief scriptures truth  opposition  approaches   instead examining mainstream christian fundamentalist beliefs  authors simply define fundamentists  totally closed world view   damn fundamentalists guilt supposed association ayatollah khomeini  david koresh taliban lastly  title misleading  especially sold secular stores   the title would accurately  _a liberal christian response philosophy  instead current title 
2,a whole bunch commercials couple articles even less pictures worth looking 
3,i tad disapointed  price honest  i ordered cd christmas gift someone delivered promptly  received  days estimated time    great condition  pleased  however  cd  think bit expensive  i expecting set something price paid   shipping charges  product  when delivered opened box  little cd there    the music good fault reading desription better  if  way i would spend much cd 
1,what single worst cd ever made how someone thought good idea hank sr  s low fi mono recordings  peel voice put modern  digital stereo surrounding beyond me imagine hank jr singing line  great guitar solo  hank iii taking vocal turn  guitar solo  hank sr coming vocals seem lp found lying gravel somewhere flea market it beyond bad  not good idea  nothing like  there s tear my beer   
2,i picked back seeing hank iii first time  perhaps hank jr fans worth time hank sr  hank iii fan disappointing  i m aware family lineage i n t need hear blend voices appreciate songwriting talent hank williams i talk hank iii recording sounded like dad s idea  out dozens recordings three artists  least favorite 
5,excellent    the way compiled  great voices together miracle    the sound simply  awesome   one hank sing part  another hank sing another part   these re mixed upbeat rock versions hank william s classics  this cd contains classic  men broken hearts   everyone hear song  this simply poetic masterpiece   hank s version  awesome   this  required  listening hank fan    i ve seen hank jr perform live great  thanks may god bless   
2,i love legos  little disappointing  the roof tiles wider  normal  lego tiles kits  n t combine sets  the reason i got set create bigger houses  i still n t since tiles n t match tiles  not sure  as windows doors  great

4,the third secret timely piece fiction steve berry  the book alleged appearances virgin mary throughout last years  father colin michener  papal secretary  brought potential conspiracy mentor  pope clement  we find conspiracy past popes cover part  the third  secret   part marian appearance  this secret part would allegedly contradict present church doctrine this nice work fiction  based good bit truth  if like dan brown  enjoy book 
2,i wish catholic bashing would stop  perhaps way would realrd secret  i finished book i took total fantasy  if put aside preconceptions doctrine  catholic history  etc  willing go ride without expecting thing make  catholic sense   book actually rather enjoying plot  of course  actualrd secret  revealed everyone reviewing book  ludicrous  entertaining set aside everything else  so s expect  steve berry novel  universe  you expect get know buying author  nothing 
3,i thought book great disclosed third secret it suspense  mystery romance  ending lame  the author could used creativity 
1,i kept reading past midpoint book  hoping going another liberal inspired jab catholic church  but  wore  sure enough liberal jargon found way final chapters  pro choice  homosexuality ok  female priests  married priests  this suppose novel  i hate see author play fast loose factual history satisfy political motive  this book waste time  my first steve berry read  last 
1,this book rife misconceptions catholic church disappointing read anyone even slightest understanding marian apparitions  the suspense builds finally  near book  missing portion  third secret fatima  revealed  the problem missing portion secret preposterous unbelievable  making climax book disappointment i surprised best selling author steve berry would produce book poorly researched  he lost credibility i never read another books beyond betraying author s ignorance catholic church  book poorly edited many typos  at point  even main characters misspelled  while many would find book s suspense compelling  i thought reading waste time 
1,i began reading steve berry s books order  the first two fine  the third secret absurd  i got almost gave  very rarely i finish book i get  i overlook implausability use imagination reading  far  i thought dan brown s demons  angels pretty farfetched  the third secret even worse  i particularly religious  n t i offended book  i stopped reading mr berry s books quite time book  i finally decided pick next book  much better far i recommend author  general  light  entertaining reading  skip installment 
3,this third suspense novel published steve berry i aware  it good beach read   however  secret  disappointing  you read discover clever not i read previous two novels published fourth novel bedstand read soon so far  i still amber room best 
3,an interesting read keep going secret revealed way main characters reacted throughout   spoilers i two main issues plot  if really revelation god via mary  things would he choose reveal things  why global push towards clarifying religion    since revelations anti catholic current sense  would n t main characters think might deception devil  i mean apparition says s mary  believe s mary  what happened faith necessary sign  if obvious signs time  would n t need faith the book much potential  i think berry blew 
3,although intriguing  author fails acknowledge our lady s message love repetence substitutes tolerance  berry s characters interesting takes many liberties liking  a good read far fatima fiction  i place book far windswept house secret fatima 
2,i ve read berry s books although i mostly enjoyed story lines  i progressively grew weary berry re writes version christianity  i realize fiction  story seemed try harder change truths christianity  i read the third secret last  finally decided stop reading berry s books  writing mary  mother jesus  visiting earth telling us heaven approves homosexuality abortion fine s mother wants    i realize everyone believes bible  but  two issues clearly defined  interesting  writer s note  book  discusses fact fiction   absolutely fails mention fictional words put mouth mary  decent story ficticious third secret revealed 
3,i truly enjoyed suspense intrigue surrounding main character s  colin  search discover third secret  i sure  real   backstabbing inner workings vatican fascinating however  many plot devices  vatican secretary state using colin s ex lover spy  numerous recording devices around vatican  shades nixon  rang false  author really stretching  i n t get feeling i read davinci code  books seems like second grade imitation most disappointing revelationrd secret  this alluded previous reviews  i n t give away  suffice say  s highly disappointing leave feeling cheated do n t buy book  check library 
2,the author quite talented  book well written  the religious history interesting  there sufficient adventure  intrigue excitement but central theme  many core beliefs catholicism odds god purports serve  mary repudiated beliefs  progressive pope shortly put beliefs  stretch  devolves anti catholic message wrapped around good yarn  this exacerbated depiction high church officials evil mafia type figures readily engage heinous acts  including murder extortion  yes  church officials past guilty deceit cover ups protect child abusers  far cry high church officials engaging conduct rivaling characters  the godfather  series  but comparing catholic church evil demonstrated movies cup tea  book 
4,typical steven berry book  action thriller historical fact base  a quick read keeps pages turning  i enjoy books immensely  particular book little far fetched heavenly appartitions such having siad  great entertainment  provides enough interesting historical tidbits remains classic berry good read 
4,although good read  nice build  couple nasty bad guys including pope side kick seemed trained terrorist camp  ending unbelieveable quite strained  i n t imagine bvm  blessed virgin mary  agreeing liberals issues today s citizens  understanding empathizing plight  yes  far i would go 
2,i enjoyed berry s two novels  despite reading reviews complained books far fetched improbable  i mind suspending reality read book watch movie  book took things little far  i catholic  maybe i found berry s third secret revealed fatima subsequently hidden church unbelieveable  there several parts secret  berry would limited scope  book would compelling believeable  the portion secret deals motherhood totally improbable berry goes far  also  trite villian novel always able figure protagonist s next step  this book starts well  attempts accomplish much  makes difficult reader suspend reality enjoy story 
2,if n t mind liberal propaganda way berry totally ignores scripture contradicts agenda  may enjoy book  it page turner  however  third secret finally revealed  quite anti climatic build up given  i expecting something apocolyptic got democratic platform social policy instead  conservative catholics christians happen believe bible true find book offensive 
5,sure  secret  outrageous   said organized religion general  i n t problem  i loved book thought great plot entertaining read  i believe intended  hello  fiction  it n t preachy didactic therefore  general  annoying many authors seem similar subjects  case point  the last templar raymond khoury  omg  bleck      taken  good page turner  s berry s best  opinion  certainly inspired read novels  first i read   none disappointed date 
4,pretty good story  really enjoyed concept books fast pace  looking forward reading author s works  thumbs 
3,as far modern pop thrillers go  ok steve berry placed likes dan brown tom clancy  yes  books good  literature never  regardless  berry great job building suspense delivering goods  my problem    potential spoiler   ending  without completely giving away  i found uninspired  unimaginative  plain disappointing  to credit  i seen coming  telegraphed throughout novel  still  kind books  i typically walk away like i  good  movie  this n t case here aside  like typical catholic conspiracy evil cardinals  like  it appears  catholic  conspiracies dreamt within church george bush s presidency 
4,it good read  weak ending  i ve read worst  his two books better endings  however  good  the history lesson useful  i would buy book  now i think i buy next  templar legacy  tell 
1,ready third secret      wait     spoiler alert      god is sick of the church s opposition to homosexuality and abortion  among things  
2,to preface  i religious i politically liberal  this book terrible  the beginning rest novels pick grocery store  warrants couple stars  ending terrible  the third secret bunch author s political views shoved mouth virgin mary  i disappointed i read three quarters book s worth build up ridiculous climax 
1,i looked forward book  i enjoyed  the romanov prophecy  fun summer read  unfortunately  berry s allowed religious social views turn latest book screed  the hero s antagonist cardinal believes priestly celibacy traditional catholic dogma  makes merely wrong headed scheming  blackmailing  cartoon villain everything twirl mustache ties heroine railroad tracks  the  secret  barry s concocted intended  provocative  model  the da vinci code   instead revelation manages hilarious  s word  blasphemous  save time money 
3,not bad writing  plot interesting  however i find mr berry problems characterization  and serious dislike catholic church  s review his female leads often start strong  turn one dimension flat  contributing nothing story save another  i noticed the romanov prophecy  well  villains seem omnipotent  they know things use knowledge very conveniently foil whatever hero trying accomplish specific story  colin michener seems little nave foolish  i m sure managed live  let alone uncover third secret  as secret   i found unbelievable  again  suspense good  secret  no 
2,and i recovering catholic episcopalian  also  registered democrat moderate liberal views  part argument religous  left  far religous  right  seem everything clearly outlined defined  like taking bible verbatim  with exception ten comandments anything said bible jesus clear bell       that  left think bible divine inspiration divine dictation  there way mother god would clearly say thingsrd secret suppose reveal clearly syntax dayst century      it interesting point author clement pope german birth book probably started long benedict s election  the stuff st malachy s predictions interesting althought probably fraud 
2,this book  according various sources  written  hardly intruding brown territory esp regard book angels demons  deals election pope  compared brown books lowkey version events makes actually rather effective  unfortunately ends making mistake brown book  villains turn worthy sympathy heroes  in particular cardinal alberto valendrea  barry determined paint scoundrel  admiration far unhappy colin mitchner colorless girlfriend  both father cardinal contesting content lost third secret fatima  reviewer s opinion might well stayed lost  the book s good airport read  s little serious import 
4,let begin saying novel way similar davinci code teased cover  however  good suspenseful story made hard put  although fictional  story built around number true facts  i enjoyed author s visual descriptions locale scenery  i liked characters  however  i find ambrosi little hard believe could elevated high position church  fiction  the writing interested reading works author 
3,i really did enjoy book  problems left shaking head  the death book completely unnecessary  i would liked see plot twist point hell   i n t know   fake tic tac s mentos the story pretty basic  evil church leaders   i trouble feeling anything charecters  maybe littel development necessary i do not agree reviewers hammer book s message  the dogma created church whole reason message is plausable took hours knock s  pass arounder  circle friends i hope next book better 
2,held attention airplane ride  hence  stars   i sincerely disappointed last third  kept reading i n t think author would brazen  trivializes current political  social  religous arguments insulting degree 
2,the book suspenceful throughout i enjoyed much i could wait get back  ending less satisfying boardered  corny   
4,this well written book deals operation politics catholic church  specifically vatican 
5,steve berry become favourite authors  the third secret disappoint  get ready thrilling ride 
4,i read book two days loved  what third secret fatima church long release  while fiction novel poses intriguing questions religion  faith told believe  great book conspiracy theorists  curious faithful 
2,this book deals ever fascinating subject prophesies  vatican church  corrupt officials  the book good grip suspense tries create  actually aggravates reader  frustrates  the plot different usual da vinci code  type books  could handled much efficiently  in  book good reading  definitely keeper 
2,the third secret follows typical suspense thriller model  it adequately interesting keep reading  the early pages filled interesting bits information vatican s history  however   and i n t give away secret  page  book takes dive  steve berry apparently thinks object shoves personal views divisive church issues  but whether agree  revelation completely unwarranted  i suppose berry trying set religious thriller vein dan brown s  heretical  books  in book devolves treastise berry s personal views  presented way debate impossible  that added absolutely deplorable behavior story s protagonists  berry makes attempt challenge  makes book disappointing read best 
2,each taste  i wish i d read negative reviews i wasted time money book  the  secret  revealed book author s personal  overt political pro abortion gay marriage agenda  seriously  christian  favor skip ridiculous attempt make fun christian beliefs 
3,of steve berry novels  happens slowest s written  it s  opinion  worst book s written while berry always detail orientated  gets bogged details  further  never really seems get point  the  climax  book really stifled yawn i firm policy reading book way   however time  i almost n t make  too details  many threats  many political  intrigues  without excitement back  enough berry s famous nail biting  adventure death right hero  heroines tale avoid   s good 
4,this second steve berry novel i read  certainly better amber room  the plot intriguing story held interest novel the downside novel third secret n t shocking  second straight novel  s five letter word describe personality lead female character  is berry misogynist going divorce drafting novels  also  antagonists almost cartoonish  how individuals become priests first place 
1,i truly enjoyed good portion book  i read quickly i could n t wait find third secret  but  i disappointed  the secret revealed virgin turns liberal  politically correct nonsense  i could barely finish book 
2,the book pretty well written  typical conservatives evil ones liberals good guys  how tiresome plotline   but unforgivable third secret  it plain stupid  any knows anything catholicism laugh third secret  it wishful thinking people catholicism cafeteria style  i stopped reading 
2,this book targets political issues right heart catholic church  s unbelievable part  cardinals engages priests kill priests maintain status quo ultimately become pope  i m catholic i n t think premise book actions characters believable 
4,this first steve berry s books i ve read  i liked much i bought novels i could lay hands  favorite local used books store   it action packed well researched  i admit conclusion book seems bit far fetched  his depiction vatican s intrigues seem far truth though  except perhaps murder parts   it kind novel i find perfect relax day vacation 
3,i enjoyed read  secret really  i tried imagine much intrigue vatican probably amusing 
2,the characters berry s novel seem computer generated  story  once  evil catholic church hidden  truth  blind  stupid laity  must recued liberal elite  those priests  bishops  nuns failed live vows due exclusive knowledge  truth   i e   situational   berry quotes extensively scripture piece work  he even quotes scripture makes whole story plain silly   what loose earth loosed heaven  bind earth  bound heaven   guess overlooked   us loyal church  dumb  blind  catch   i m old woman  i ll stick ongoing conversations jesus eucharist  rosary   plain  listening   by way steve  jesus loves    he s fond way presented his mother kathleen rineytroy  tx 
2,although the third secret first book i bought and or read steve berry  i impressed  the first two thirds book written well  the book bviously puts catholic church bad light  the mysterious untold portion third secret  keeps reading book  bizaar completely rediculous blew away semblance believability reader may point  what severe let  fiction type retain trace believablity even  i recommend book 
1,painfully  painfully  painfully bad  at first s bad writing stock cardboard characters  if re looking psychological nuance complexity  n t open book  thank god author spared us love scenes  but time secrets revealed  book descended comic awfulness reserved greatest bad books  i writhing groaning couch  if book club used reading good books  read sometime  around like guys mystery science theater great time poking fun  but hey  best seller  says lot us n t  
2,i wanted like book could n t  it close slow  predicatable certainly thriller  somewhat interesting twist  secret  enough recommend must read 
4,the author brings characters focus makes us  detest  i n t much interest fatima appearances mary  necessary enjoy well researched drama oldest continuing institution history  the catholic church  the author linked together events church history give modern view vatican modern struggles within church within society  i m catholic  book gives appraciation vatican means billions people 
3,another vatican bad fast paced suspense novel  well written certainly fairly well researched  my  complaint  wonderful research mr berry done  things certainly highly inaccurate  among  certainly least  burial place pope john xxiii  when author makes foolish little mistake  makes wonder else went wrong 
1,i agree  disappointing  review would add resolution mystery could without author s agenda  to suggest blessed mother would actually call murder  suicide  abortion  homosexuality promiscuity priesthood appalling  i would reccomend book anyone i full time employee county library upscale community  i tell patrons pass novel 
2,plot line may twists turns newer spin  book n t  new  terms fast paced thriller  mr berry keep reader engaged  many books market similiar plot lines centering around church  well  see ending actually happens  the characters pretty much stererotypical  woman hard boiled woman lost faith forth  love interest   however  need good read plane traveling  pick 
2,the third secret good story  unfortunately written mediocre manner  the plot shallow poorly developed times  obvious  its akin work amateur published author  although berry seems stumbled penning work  editor badly let reader  errors prose  style consistency numerous mention i suggest wish read berry s work wait paperback edition visit public library  the third secret poor waste hard earned wages 
4,this book great read anyone  even better background religion  it great factual basis yet spins great fiction book readers enjoy    spoiler   great timing due new pope taking office  well catholic issues marriage  children  etc news  i would recommend anyone enjoyed dan browns books  would encourage readers check steve berry s novels 
1,being big fan genre  i read quite steve berry s books enjoyed point  but reading the third secret  i never read another steve berry book again the plot line borrowed significantly likes dan brown davinci code angels  demons books without providing anything original besides ludicrous conclusion  when i finally arrived conclusion terrible felt like i got punked berry  i physically threw book disgust i never read terrible book life goodbye steve berry 
1,  frustrating  another review said really hits nail head  the suspense whole book waiting see third secret takes find  only find   suicide o k    priests marry    homosexuality o k    abortion o k  so much could done book  how many people disturbed fact virgin mary actually told pope kill 
5,brilliant video  i agree replacement everyday play excessive tv watching good anyone   but first hand practical experience daughter loves certainly learned practical things   dont put tv everyday just every often   restless ill   mommy really needs get something done     much prefers anything else seen past   fact dvd gets excited about it wonderful format copy gives simple great ideas easy play  good new parent  it thing would stop crying teething   rate valuable things bought

3,in general  book good overview topics needed get six sigma certification  however  large number mistakes typos unacceptable  a lot confusion created poor text editing just think  book printed asq  quality press   they quality 
1,this book came six pages errata  even  i still found multiple mistakes throughout book  this book six sigma written sigma level  i would recommend book anybody  you trust book 
5,it said whole movie much whether like disliked movie  rather  leave lasting impression upon  taking idea account  i would say  singapore sling  without doubt indelible addition film noir genre  albeit bizarro kind  as reviewers mentioned  movie n t taken seriously  you open mind ll rewarded beautifully photographed film noir filled black humor   singapore sling  like demented cousin  laura     sunset boulevard    grey gardens   it s basic detective story torture  bizarre erotica  outstanding overacting  just make sure parents asleep ve got right kind friend tow watching 
5,obviously live troubled times  many unable confront tragic events recently took place  others feel important know ahead us  if like mind read nostradamus predictions of world war iii  it contains host material seers earlier prophecies right third anti christ said living middle east  does book answers    probably  author delve meaning nostradamus words well bringing visions seers current  and  addition  things besides predictions world war iii contemplate  even invasion space 
3,it s okay read  the beginning chapters interesting  later book  seems like author run material started talk aliens ufos  there better books topic 
4,another interesting book nostradamus predictions wwiii  it wothwhile reading believing    everything  it well explained verses nostradums wrote matter interpretation 
1,we n t receive item called company ask  they said longer making  neither company amazon bothered let us know  we get refund dragged  i suggest amazon discontinue relationship parts lego company  our grandson disappointed huge lego fan  shame  lego

2,there s minutes horror film  but rest  hours made  confused people trying terms histories related horror story portion analogy  s brief contact dead children   there supposed psychological reason behind horror  n t strike particularly insightful  instead dreary  the acting  even jun ji hyun  dreary  the actions characters dreary  the sign life comes fiancée  strong  dynamic performance attractive yu seon to see jun ji hyun best  i recommendmy sassy girl  daisy  oril mare 
3,the social system technocracy way  sentient  races interact quite interesting  festina great character s able taking  the fight get melaquin keep jelca destroying world good  i liked writing  pacing  way novel formatted however  extremely irritating facet book kept solid  star  oar  snooty  whiney  blithering  oar took lot enjoyment story  she got skin good way  her personality grating  she could much better character 
4,festina  admiral chee make great pair characters start book  i wish sort duo could continued longer  the humor replaced duo n t effective  melaquin seems like ideal place settle n t myth surrounding place  the follow adventure well done ideas kind boring  unadventurous  however  entire idea expendables hilarious sad time 
2,this book novel premise s  this might made good short story  novel completely uninspiring  the characters cardboard cutouts inspire empathy  the plot consists unbelievable deus ex machina turn another  the contrived mini chapters giveaway titles annoying  the natives planet melaquin depth ingenuity behind  do n t bother book 
5,i m getting tired wading novels main antagonist incredibly annoying  left plot d reason continue writing without    so get annoyed character book  mercifully  ends expendible books  the characters strange never annoying  if nothing else  re human without resorting extremes  the book reads quickly cleanly you d inclined think s fluff  since read well  s actually quite bit food thought interesting insight human nature  go read 
4,i ve gotten back reading sci fi books  i say interesting story  the characters lead sad life  course vindicated  the plot took twist landed  planet   i n t expecting  i might add   became somewhat political  i still enjoyed  i ll likely read books part series 
3,it s imaginative fast paced  logic problems never quite grabbed  it starts pretty well  stalls middle in final analysis  s straightforward s f  s interesting enough worth look 
3,like good sf  book makes uncomfortable points current society picking facet exaggerating  how see  different  meet standards physical perfection  in book  frankly contemporary america  distasteful look expendable  this book takes extreme  wraps powerful evocative story  unfortunately  gardner finds necessary sprinkle miracles improbabilities add little story message  the characters solid well envisioned  gardner tells story elegantly well  much novel   expendable  overall  though  good novel complex issues  well worth time takes read 
1,basically i agree john clute s assessment novel  mr gardner fine writer  knack using really dumb sociobiological explanations  let us hope mulled consequences writing commitment hour  he deserves another chance 
2,the first chapters original content writing style  i intrigued reading hopes high  original  adventure  alas  author quickly ran promising creativeness book turned amalgam sci fi books  it felt like reading ringworld meshed others  my interest lost i skimmed latter two thirds book without losing much 
5,this a stirring sf adventure that pits a memorableheroine  festina rampos against a strange anddeadly world which she is stranded on  in thethcentury there is no war  crime or poverty but ifyou are deformed  crippled you are probably aexplorer sent to different worlds and your lifeis not worth very much  this novel of adventureand discovery was fascinating and festina wasa heroine you can easily root for 
4,this book surprised  for gardner s first books  great  he tosses around tons different concepts ideas ease  he paints vivid picture universe  the technocracy  regulates lifeform s behavior eliminating non sentients  this s self makes pretty interesting rules  in story  main characters must deal rules  bend  and way happens mixes recipe n t typical sci fi fare very interesting stuff 
3,this lightweight somewhat  say   restrained   s lead character  characters lacking detail intensity s story line  the entire plot reads like juvenile comic book  rather serious piece sci fi not even close personal best author  genre  still fairly good read late night rainy weekend 
3,i d read couple chapters  n t really find engaging  i set  intended returning  i picked back i d run books  decided stick hopes d get better  the premise story good intriguing  i found actual content boring  i felt main character festina flat  d  it hard keep hearing thought would better told another character s perspective  also  i know language oar set tone learned english  overdone  the repetitive cussing dulled purpose made annoying  rating  idea premise  b  content  c  overall  c 
3,explorer festina ramos  partner crazy admiral exiled planet of no return  they expendable ugly freaks  i admit i somewhat expected comedy novel  raise odd mild laugh really memorable novel i really keep somehow festina woes exiled fail raise great deal tension  her problems turn mostly reasonably easily solved book slides like bland desert  i know books series  i say first instalment make inclined seek 
2,the red limit another timothy s ferris excellent distilliations astrophysics public consumption  as usual  skilled making science concepts comprehensible bringing vivid detail story science  know know  it even includes occasional philosophical discussion so low rating  because book twenty years old  i assumed reprint would maybe updated material  n t  this effectively book state cosmology circa do n t waste money  ferris s whole shebang better written date  you might check lonely hearts cosmos  similar book far better updatee recent discoveries  bill bryson s brief history nearly everything covers cosmology basic detail  far up to date 
5,another classic story author artist graham oakley  the church mice books best  artwork priceless  hilarious    check books  they great 
3,patterson fine job presenting years watergate bush gore scratches surface underlying stories  i believe sufficiently cover dramatic effect watergate executive branch government  it empowered legislative judiciary branches ever  ever intended constitution  it caused presidents followed less endowed executive powers intended made word   gate  suffix described every stumble executive encountered  it made american public distrustful leaders  granted failure great magnitude  since graded political individual warily 
3,i found two books patterson  grand expectations restless giant  two weakest series  i lived times caught cliches times  n t capture times  that said  books informative worth reading 
2,i love history books read books series this weak  it starts okay  go along  becomes reviewers noted  opinionated  biased piece  but even  book stops reading history narrative mishmash events ever present biased commentary i hate putting books started took better part two years get  i could pages time i d set aside while anyway  i say major disappointment 
3,this series generally excellent  patterson s effort drifts sociology history  he predictably dislikes nixon like   academics  this volume something disappointment 
3,this rather superficial book questionable value  it presents jack welch s slogans without almost discussion declares genius  jack welch interesting manager whose methods results deserve lot detailed approach  each slogans ideas analyzed  discussed explained good example  otherwise  book written  ideas taken seriously professional  this book serves good introduction jack welch manager  really learn something  better buy different book 
3,i previously read  jack welch ge way   slater published  i never read original version  get better get beaten   this newer version  get better    contained substantial amount material already covered detail  ge way  book  except material covering events since  i think  ge way  better choice two  especially re looking detail analysis  in many ways i felt like i re reading book  on hand  re looking sort cliff notes  version good insight six sigma  newer  smaller work slater certainly satisfactory  there s marginal benefit reading 
4,robert slater puts together factual wonderfully insightfull collection jack welch s leadership secrets  a must read anyone wants effective leader

3,this book nice  clear instructions  i would recommend book someone already beginning knowledge basic knitting 
3,fight the good fighti ve paid thousands dollars attend real estate seminars full time real estate investor  legrand king selling product  the books well worth investment usually learn enough earn many times paid information book  on hand seminars  courses really pricey  many people spend upwardsk seminars without ever real estate deal  legrand s greatest student probably robin thompson  queen rehabs  become millionaire many times using techniques  i m students   i good friend spent  grand legrand course never made money  in essence depends person  some techniques become wealthy  others n t

1,it s first time use tivo  this product user friendly  the hardware setup requirs either network  wired  phone line  otherwise n t work  the software designed without exit  if n t like choices n t good case  way skip  it takes hours set  bad design hardware software amazon service excellent 
2,this tivo series dual tuner limited surround sound capabilities  if not using cable satellite box  chances not get surround sound device i running coax cable directly tivo  outputs going directly a v processor  similar vcr tv  my vcr tv producing surround sound  the tivo able send  channel signal i spent almost  hours phone tivo customer support able help continued claim tivo supports surround  however  tivo s website customer forum  i found dozens entries issues supporting surround this appears design flaw 
3,i n t find after i bought tivo i needed sign monthly payments phone line devoted  plus  power failure  takes  minutes tivo reboot i n t like way operated i took landfill got dvr satillite company  half monthly charge twice nice 
2,the tivo arrived good condition easly install  however use device must internet access tv subscribe service montly fee  i prepared either returned device original shipper

5,i longer schedule day around tv  i enjoy program time  i set tivo night going bed n t concern missing favorite programs  thank you  thank you  thank you 
1,perhaps time read amazon clearer tivo description  case n t  need know hardware monthly pay service  i really felt taken ride  referred  service plan    well  i n t  service plan  oven  works fine  it completely misleading call fee charge every month  service plan   tivo n t getting penny   
3,buyers know reason dvr selling   the dual tuner technology outdated  in order dual tuner work  channels analog  in words  record analog channel watching recording another analog digital channel  however  recent switch digital tv  longer analog channels watch record  so  dual tuner useless point i m completely disappointed purchase  however  even though limited watching recording channel time  still good dvr great price  if good low price dvr  get 
5,after spending years cox communications dvrs  motorola scientific atlanta  dealing problems cause  recording everything  recording  crashing  dying etc   decided try tivo  i yet find flaw piece equipment it records supposed  supposed  i love new tivo 
1,tivo copmlete scam  they sell unit year contract   month warranty  the day comes warranty  turn system takes forever respond button clicks making unit worthless  call support  offer sell another  save time  buy tv capture card  buy vcr  buy dvr different company  stay away from tivo  it s scam

3,it s ok price  i gave ok dvr recording drive  channel information even getting netflix etc work unless account tivo   monthly fee   i basically use tuner monitor home  i sure i tivo account i would find lot use receiver 
2,my dad bought tivo mom christmas  excited  however  eventhough easy hook  soon started conflicting hd channels messed sound  also  goes rampages taping shows random quickly filling given hrs  i figured sound problem probably loose audio wires i checked time time  i called tech support i waited hold almost hour told sometimes audio feed would fragment offered replace tivo i shipped back original box   more effort worth  should ve gotten charter dvr  i dont recommend product cable box 
2,i bought i could share movies vids computer tivo play tv  you still need pay monthly subscription thou  you need pay software enable  i realized easier get wireless video audio sender send movies wirelessly tv  month  however  i suppose market somewhere house 
1,please aware  even sign  monthly service plan   plan annual  thing monthly fee  i personally find nomenclature incredibly deceptive purposefully misleading customers  i would recommend staying away tivo 
2,the product works fine  however i told tivo service work  i purchase tivo system  use solely dvr hooked computer  consequently i purchase yearly service  able use purpose i feel unfair  i choose send back due shipping costs returning allow use two weeks without purchasing service  i n t hook right away due vacation arrived  i close return point well  i feel unfair advertise product without foreclosing fact use simpley dvr still need purchase high cost tivo 
3,order extrememly difficult complete online person phone help line clear grasp english langguage that unacceptable
3,this dvr works great  need get tivo work  i wanted dvr  i  without subscription pretty primitive  get subscription machine lot cheaper

5,when i say tivo best thing far dvr s right s understatement  this product absolutely wonderful  i  happy product  i highly recommend 
4,lots of great features and will handle comcast digital channels  the remote is annoying to use 
1,do n t purchase extended warranty  i purchased  year extended warranty tivo broke  months  we put initial tivo even though would record voice turners time like advertised  network card went  thought would get serviced  the network card went bad  sent another unit  hard drive failure within day  i got second exchange told extended warranty would cover replacement unit voidst exchange brandon customer service person help  i never buy anything tivo logo 
3,ouch  you n t buy tivo  need tivo service subscription costs  annually  tivo  i might planet n t know that i wanted dvr replace old vcr  record cable tv channels  without subscription service  new tivo dead box  if replace old vcr  like   make sure new item digital tuner n t require subscription 
3,i tivo fan several years recently upgraded dual tuner version  unfortunately  tivo s idea  dual tuner  really designed use basic cable  i digital cable  i watch analog signal tvs cable box  in area  basic cable signal weak static i prefer watch digital signal  i expect able record either  the way tivo implemented channel changing  always switches analog cable signal n t even let pick digital signal unless specifically tell n t receive channel analog source  however  single tuner  n t allow record channel watching other i hate say  tivo real disappointment 
1,stop  you n t get amazon prime videos  it s linking problems tivo kept sending amazon  amazon showed fix tivo  tivo could told  and charge monthly fee  roku fee  s cheaper  easier use 
4,we selected product daughter apt  cable signal still analog  there ethernet signal bedroom installed wireless router  the tivo needs either phone hook internet connection  since n t land line internet connection living room wanted tv purchase wireless ubs adapter order pick signal  also  problem security router matching adapter changed wap setting wep able complete installation  once set up  seems working well  best  problem getting tivo tech speak us 
3,installation took several hours frustrating  more clear instructions would helpful  the rebate center site customer friendly  different terms used interchangeably instructions complete  the site would service number unit  email rebate customer service never answered  eventually i reached customer service person telephone  general customer service number  rebate number  gives tapes  solved problem manually  i d suggest calling number  booklet comes unit  first sign trouble 
1,the dual tuner feature n t work model tivo june  do n t buy 
1,tivo worked two weeks using tivo wireless adapter  all sudden stopped working giving  network adapter found error  did usual resets router  tivo  etc nothing  called tivo sent new adapter  plugged new adapter problem  called tivo  wasted bunch time people clueless  now i wait business days new tivo unit arrive to sum  clueless customer service no way record given time without network connection froze oftenit seems like tivo company gotten ahead 
4,i gave wife christmas hooked tivo  basically  like everyone says  changes way watch tv  bye bye commercials  see stuff n t watch  now really watch get watch schedule  having said  reason i give five stars setup quite undertaking  the hooking n t bad  oodles menus follow  got part linking wireless network went heads  we still yet get feature function  even purchase separately wireless network adapter  seems though network must set pretty specific way  luckily still phone line well would creek  overall i would say tivo makes happy
